1
00:00:03,521 --> 00:00:05,804
Hey. Get out of my chair,
or I'll have you disbarred.

2
00:00:05,924 --> 00:00:07,807
Oh, wait.
That already happened.

3
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:09,442
- Cash.
- Tango.

4
00:00:09,477 --> 00:00:12,079
My old partner in my new firm.

5
00:00:14,316 --> 00:00:15,837
Does it get any better?

6
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:17,074
Not unless you leave.

7
00:00:17,109 --> 00:00:18,660
Still got it.

8
00:00:18,693 --> 00:00:20,928
So a little birdie told me

9
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,847
you're graduating
kiddie college.

10
00:00:22,882 --> 00:00:24,615
You must be excited
to get that lollipop.

11
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:27,099
Hey.
It's a sticker.

12
00:00:27,219 --> 00:00:27,902
Ha.

13
00:00:27,937 --> 00:00:30,355
I know you're busy, not,
so allow me to whip it out.

14
00:00:30,373 --> 00:00:31,522
Come work with me.

15
00:00:31,556 --> 00:00:33,091
You'll be a full partner,
six figures,

16
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:34,591
corner office,
three secretaries.

17
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:35,694
What's that?
Not enough money?

18
00:00:35,728 --> 00:00:36,978
I'll double it.
Bam, done.

19
00:00:37,029 --> 00:00:38,612
That's how we negotiate.
Lunch?

20
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:40,832
Wow.
I drive a hard bargain.

21
00:00:40,865 --> 00:00:43,250
But, mark, aren't you worried
I'm a little out of practice?

22
00:00:43,286 --> 00:00:46,137
The only cases I've tried lately
are about sandwiches and yams.

23
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,637
Please, you were
a better lawyer

24
00:00:47,656 --> 00:00:48,656
when you weren't a lawyer

25
00:00:48,658 --> 00:00:50,040
than most lawyers I know.

26
00:00:50,076 --> 00:00:51,042
It's still in you.

27
00:00:51,076 --> 00:00:53,795
I'll give it some thought.

28
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:56,085
Just shake my hand, idiot.
It's simple.

29
00:00:59,784 --> 00:01:00,951
I like simple.

30
00:01:00,987 --> 00:01:02,786
Take a look around, Winger.

31
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,923
This is your new old life.

32
00:01:04,956 --> 00:01:06,257
I don't get it.

33
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:08,259
We just had Christmas,
and now it's warm outside.

34
00:01:08,293 --> 00:01:09,343
Of course it is, dummy.

35
00:01:09,394 --> 00:01:10,978
We just finished
fall-spring semester.

36
00:01:11,013 --> 00:01:12,346
Bring on summer-winter.

37
00:01:12,397 --> 00:01:13,647
I can't wait.

38
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:15,066
My final film school class
is just called opinions.

39
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,251
Professor Taylor
is scheduled to teach,

40
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,368
but I have a rebuttal.

41
00:01:17,402 --> 00:01:18,802
Lucky.

42
00:01:18,837 --> 00:01:20,771
I transferred to forensics late
and got the worst classes.

43
00:01:20,805 --> 00:01:23,992
Skull fragment collection,
advanced advanced decomp,

44
00:01:24,025 --> 00:01:26,293
and intro to senselessness
were all full.

45
00:01:26,329 --> 00:01:27,912
I still have a year
of A/C repair left.

46
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,046
I passed all my classes,

47
00:01:29,081 --> 00:01:30,248
so now I just do yoga

48
00:01:30,281 --> 00:01:31,349
while the teachers
write down my wisdoms.

49
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:33,734
Wait a minute.
Jeff passed history.

50
00:01:33,769 --> 00:01:34,985
He's graduating early.

51
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,287
I'm totally unprepared
to deal with this.

52
00:01:37,323 --> 00:01:38,605
No, Annie,
please, don't--

53
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:42,593
Well, it's official.
It's on a banner.

54
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:44,045
Congratulations, Jeffrey.

55
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,362
You worked hard
not to work hard

56
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:46,414
to earn that degree.

57
00:01:46,448 --> 00:01:47,581
Yeah, you took
so many blow-off classes

58
00:01:47,633 --> 00:01:48,665
and pointless electives.

59
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,616
What did you end up
majoring in?

60
00:01:49,652 --> 00:01:50,652
Education.

61
00:01:50,686 --> 00:01:51,870
You had to win, didn't you?

62
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,905
When I was inches
from the finish line.

63
00:01:53,938 --> 00:01:54,889
Pierce, you have
so many credits,

64
00:01:54,924 --> 00:01:55,884
they have grand-credits.

65
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:56,890
Just graduate already.

66
00:01:56,926 --> 00:01:58,206
When's the graduation ceremony?

67
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:59,828
Never.
It's community college.

68
00:01:59,861 --> 00:02:02,930
You just send in some papers
and they stop charging you.

69
00:02:02,981 --> 00:02:04,783
It's moving, in its own way.

70
00:02:04,817 --> 00:02:06,034
So this is it?

71
00:02:06,067 --> 00:02:07,468
A banner and some soda
Troy forgot to bring?

72
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:08,986
No.

73
00:02:09,021 --> 00:02:10,805
As far as graduations go,
it's boring but grounded.

74
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,924
I was hoping for more.

75
00:02:12,942 --> 00:02:13,942
Can we at least walk with you
to the Dean's office?

76
00:02:13,975 --> 00:02:15,259
What, now?
No.

77
00:02:15,276 --> 00:02:16,894
I was just--I was going
to mail it in next week,

78
00:02:16,912 --> 00:02:17,961
or, you know, whenever.

79
00:02:17,997 --> 00:02:19,030
Don't be silly.

80
00:02:19,048 --> 00:02:20,169
We started as a study group,

81
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:21,865
we'll finish as a study group.

82
00:02:21,884 --> 00:02:24,002
All for one, and one dude
we can all leave behind.

83
00:02:24,036 --> 00:02:24,985
Everybody, go quickly.

84
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,054
Go.

85
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,438
- Go, go, go, go, go, go.
- Hey.

86

87
00:02:29,692 --> 00:02:31,408

95
00:02:54,265 --> 00:02:56,968
All right, Mr. Winger.
Et al. Britta.

96
00:02:57,002 --> 00:02:58,552
Emotions are running high,

97
00:02:58,603 --> 00:03:01,105
so I will keep this
tight and short.

98
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,306
You always do.

99
00:03:02,324 --> 00:03:03,707
I see you have
all the necessary paperwork.

100
00:03:03,741 --> 00:03:06,127
Necessary?
You asked for proof of inseam.

101
00:03:06,177 --> 00:03:07,679
Ah, Jeffrey.

102
00:03:07,712 --> 00:03:11,432
I'm going to miss our playful,
"Get a room already" banter.

103
00:03:11,467 --> 00:03:12,866
- Oh, Dean.
- I can come back.

104
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,318
No, I can do this.

105
00:03:14,353 --> 00:03:16,837
Just need to sign
the old John Dean-cock

106
00:03:16,872 --> 00:03:20,775
and you will be graduated.

107
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,544
So this is it?

108
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:24,262
- Mm-hmm.
- Huh.

109
00:03:24,295 --> 00:03:27,882
I, uh--I expected
a little more pageantry.

110
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:29,884
I'm listening.

111
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:31,352
Annie's right.

112
00:03:31,402 --> 00:03:33,638
We should throw a party
to mark the occasion.

113
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:34,788
A small one.

114
00:03:34,824 --> 00:03:35,889
The teensiest.

115
00:03:35,925 --> 00:03:38,009
Just close friends,
a small cake--

116
00:03:38,043 --> 00:03:39,194
Maybe some flowers,
an archway--

117
00:03:39,228 --> 00:03:40,211
A string quartet.

118
00:03:40,228 --> 00:03:41,846
Ooh, he could wear a suit.

119
00:03:41,881 --> 00:03:42,796
Starting to sound
like a wedding.

120
00:03:42,831 --> 00:03:43,981
Not a wedding.

121
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:46,484
Just your average,
low-key diploma signing,

122
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:47,451
to which you're all
cordially invited,

123
00:03:47,485 --> 00:03:48,453
tomorrow afternoon.

124
00:03:48,486 --> 00:03:49,653
Tomorrow?

125
00:03:49,671 --> 00:03:51,088
Is that enough time
to plan a whole wedding?

126
00:03:51,122 --> 00:03:52,841
- Absolutely.
- I'll get my book.

127
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,395
Listen, I can't do a big party.

128
00:03:57,429 --> 00:03:58,479
It's too much.

129
00:03:58,531 --> 00:04:00,731
Oh, I see what's going on here.

130
00:04:00,765 --> 00:04:03,450
This is about you getting
cold feet about graduating.

131
00:04:03,502 --> 00:04:04,669
Pshh, yeah.

132
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:05,637
I've been looking forward
to graduation

133
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,920
since freshman registration.

134
00:04:06,972 --> 00:04:08,473
I already got a job lined up

135
00:04:08,507 --> 00:04:09,774
at my old partner's firm.

136
00:04:09,807 --> 00:04:11,675
Well, then, let them eat cake.

137
00:04:11,693 --> 00:04:15,062
It's just, I'm worried
that the group might not be able

138
00:04:15,114 --> 00:04:17,398
to handle it,
you know, emotionally.

139
00:04:17,432 --> 00:04:19,334
Everyone wants you
to graduate, Jeff.

140
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,785
Well, what about Abed?

141
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,836
I mean, the stress of me leaving
might send him spiraling.

142
00:04:22,872 --> 00:04:24,355
Come on,
give him some more credit.

143
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:27,307
He's really progressed since
he opened up to my therapizing.

144
00:04:27,358 --> 00:04:28,759
Do you remember last year,
when he wouldn't stop

145
00:04:28,776 --> 00:04:30,612
talking about that
"darkest timeline" thing?

146
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:31,963
The one where I lost my arm?

147
00:04:31,997 --> 00:04:33,965
And Pierce died,
and Annie went insane,

148
00:04:33,999 --> 00:04:35,933
and he blamed it all
on you throwing some dice.

149
00:04:35,968 --> 00:04:39,571
He has not brought that up
in months.

150
00:04:39,605 --> 00:04:42,490
You're right, Britta.

151
00:04:42,524 --> 00:04:44,341
I just need
to give Abed a chance.

152
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:45,659
Then it's settled.

153
00:04:45,711 --> 00:04:47,161
The six of us will
take astronomy next semester.

154
00:04:47,213 --> 00:04:48,446
So now you're leaving me out.

155
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,846
No, we're leaving Jeff out.

156
00:04:49,882 --> 00:04:52,082
So I'm not even the one
who gets left out anymore.

157
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,084
Everything's
Jeff, Jeff--

158
00:04:53,101 --> 00:04:54,067
Jeff.

159
00:04:54,103 --> 00:04:55,737
This seat taken?

160
00:04:57,122 --> 00:04:58,540
So everyone still excited
about the big shindig?

161
00:04:58,574 --> 00:04:59,891
Totally.

162
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,375
I was worried about
the wedding-graduation mash up,

163
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,911
but it's testing really well
with women.

164
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,134
Oh, well, that's a load off.

165
00:05:05,163 --> 00:05:06,213
Hey, we should probably
figure out

166
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,048
who's bringing the soda now,
right?

167
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,384
Just so there's not
another hang up.

168
00:05:09,435 --> 00:05:12,403
I brought it.
I-I just drank it all.

169
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,187
It's okay.
I've got it covered.

170
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,189
No, no, no.
You've already done so much.

171
00:05:16,242 --> 00:05:18,910
Besides, I think I have
a fun and fair way

172
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:23,548
to decide which of the six of us
will bring the soda.

173
00:05:23,581 --> 00:05:25,667
We'll roll for it.

174
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,978
It didn't land on a number.

175
00:05:38,012 --> 00:05:39,262
That probably means nothing.

176
00:05:39,281 --> 00:05:41,531
- Or it means everything.
- Let's hope not.

177
00:05:41,567 --> 00:05:43,117
You know what,
I'll bring the soda.

178
00:05:43,151 --> 00:05:44,869
Don't worry, I'll make sure
there aren't any more hang-ups.

179
00:05:44,903 --> 00:05:47,151
Must I bear this cross forever?

180
00:05:50,793 --> 00:05:52,994
I was hoping for more.

00:06:18,221 --> 00:06:21,117
Do not even tell me
you dropped that cake.

190
00:06:25,757 --> 00:06:26,990
Parasites.

191
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,180
Hey.
What's going on?

192
00:06:29,214 --> 00:06:31,475
Why are you trying
to avoid graduating?

193
00:06:31,711 --> 00:06:32,678
I wish I knew.

194
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,334
I think it's because
you're scared

195
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,504
to take this law job
with your old partner.

196
00:06:36,538 --> 00:06:38,673
But don't let that stop you
from graduating.

197
00:06:38,706 --> 00:06:40,324
Take the job,
don't take the job.

198
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:41,808
Either way, your friends
are always going

199
00:06:41,843 --> 00:06:43,194
to be here to support you.

200
00:06:43,228 --> 00:06:44,161
Good to know.

201
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:47,180
See you at graduation.

202
00:06:47,215 --> 00:06:48,949
And they call us the worst.

203
00:06:48,983 --> 00:06:50,117
Took you long enough.

204
00:06:50,151 --> 00:06:51,831
Hey, nobody said you had
to travel naked.

205
00:06:51,853 --> 00:06:53,420
Oh.
You brought the good one.

206
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:55,840
You hold that,
I'll do the sleeve.

207
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:58,259
Wait for the click.
There--

208
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:00,560
Ah.
Good.

209
00:07:00,596 --> 00:07:03,730
Middle finger works great now.

210
00:07:03,764 --> 00:07:05,266
It's worse than I thought.

211
00:07:05,283 --> 00:07:08,035
They made lame Jeff
too lame to leave Greendale.

212
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:09,637
He's got to take that job.

213
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,338
But how do we make him do that?

214
00:07:11,355 --> 00:07:13,206
By turning the study group
against him

215
00:07:13,242 --> 00:07:16,377
so he'll run screaming
from this rancid cocoon

216
00:07:16,411 --> 00:07:18,596
into the welcoming arms
of darkness.

217
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:20,047
How hard is that to understand?

218
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:21,399
It's not.

219
00:07:21,432 --> 00:07:23,151
I just like when you
talk down to me like a child.

220
00:07:27,923 --> 00:07:29,891
Oh!
Jeff.

221
00:07:29,925 --> 00:07:30,942
It's bad luck
to see the graduation

222
00:07:30,975 --> 00:07:32,108
before the graduation.

223
00:07:32,144 --> 00:07:33,394
I had to talk to you.

224
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:36,329
Today is bringing up
so many emotions.

225
00:07:36,365 --> 00:07:37,514
It's a lot to take in.

226
00:07:37,548 --> 00:07:38,882
I'm not making you feel nervous

227
00:07:38,933 --> 00:07:40,300
about graduating, am I?

228
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,372
Well, you are making me
feel something.

229
00:07:44,406 --> 00:07:46,990
And it's not about graduating.

230
00:07:47,024 --> 00:07:48,192
I'm saying I'm hot for you.

231
00:07:48,226 --> 00:07:50,577
Me?

232
00:07:50,612 --> 00:07:51,646
Is this for real?

233
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,581
Is my beating heart for real?

234
00:07:53,615 --> 00:07:54,981
Oh, Annie.

235
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,084
I don't know if it's
the beautiful decorations,

236
00:07:57,119 --> 00:07:59,536
or the impending
floral archway,

237
00:07:59,571 --> 00:08:03,673
but there's something about this
that feels so right.

238
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:06,326
It's the perfect moment
to remember you by.

239
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,978
Remember me by?

240
00:08:08,012 --> 00:08:09,362
I'm not going anywhere.

241
00:08:09,398 --> 00:08:11,348
Exactly.
You're going nowhere.

242
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:14,819
I'm about to return
to my cool, adult, lawyer life,

243
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,821
and you're going to be
stuck here, playing high school.

244
00:08:16,855 --> 00:08:17,855
Why are you saying this?

245
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,322
So you face the facts.

246
00:08:19,358 --> 00:08:21,809
Once I graduate, I'm gone.

247
00:08:26,113 --> 00:08:28,499
Winger, streaking
on your last day of school?

248
00:08:28,533 --> 00:08:30,401
Respect.

249
00:08:30,435 --> 00:08:32,253
Oh, so I got the save the date
for your graduation.

250
00:08:32,287 --> 00:08:34,538
Should I bring a date,
or try to hook up there?

251
00:08:34,572 --> 00:08:36,890
I'm not going to your
stupid graduation, jerk.

252
00:08:36,924 --> 00:08:39,210
I can't believe you said
those things to me.

253
00:08:39,244 --> 00:08:40,845
- What things?
- Don't play dumb.

254
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:42,263
You want to leave?
Leave.

255
00:08:42,297 --> 00:08:43,364
See if I care.

256
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:44,881
What did you do?

257
00:08:44,917 --> 00:08:48,152
I have no earthly idea.

258
00:08:48,202 --> 00:08:51,304
Look up there.

259
00:08:54,475 --> 00:08:56,443
- Hello, Abed.
- Hello, Evil Jeff.

260
00:08:56,477 --> 00:08:57,628
What?
How did you--

261
00:08:57,663 --> 00:08:58,946
I may not be good
with facial expressions,

262
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,697
but I know an evil doppelganger
when I see one.

263
00:09:00,731 --> 00:09:02,616
Plus your arm makes a noise
every time you move it.

264
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,051
Silence.

265
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,385
Are you here to kill Jeff?

266
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,488
Oh, you non-evils
are so naive.

267
00:09:07,522 --> 00:09:08,822
I'm here to save Jeff

268
00:09:08,856 --> 00:09:11,408
from the smothering teat
of his study group.

269
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,419
Is that a paintball gun?

270
00:09:12,443 --> 00:09:17,398
You wish.

271
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,066
Cool.

272
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,586
Wait.
Cold.

273
00:09:24,172 --> 00:09:26,106
How did I get
to the Dean's office?

274
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,390
Hi.

275
00:09:32,581 --> 00:09:37,418
Out of my chair, monkey.

276
00:09:37,436 --> 00:09:39,370
The darkest timeline.

277
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,426
Annie.

278
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:51,499
Um, okay,
let's start with "Huh?"

279
00:09:51,533 --> 00:09:55,001
Jeff, I'm sorry.
I made it all up.

280
00:09:55,037 --> 00:09:57,221
I've been so upset
about you graduating

281
00:09:57,254 --> 00:09:59,956
that I've gone
a little crazy, emotionally.

282
00:09:59,991 --> 00:10:01,942
Oh, good.
I thought I was losing my mind.

283
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,561
Make it up to you with a hug?

284
00:10:09,433 --> 00:10:11,936
This breakfast sandwich cart
is such a great idea.

285
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,703
It's never too early
for Shirley--

286
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:15,405
to make a boatload off
of hung over college kids.

287
00:10:15,456 --> 00:10:17,490
Speaking of great idea having,
hear me out.

288
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:20,360
It's called
"The Troy-jan Horse."

289
00:10:20,394 --> 00:10:24,815
It goes bread, lettuce, ham,
ham, bacon, chocolate--

290
00:10:24,865 --> 00:10:26,650
Oh, how you doing,
the graduate?

291
00:10:26,684 --> 00:10:28,985
Just stopping by
to hand out some un-vites

292
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,303
to my graduation.

293
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,139
Here's one
for the desperate housewife

294
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,674
who spends more time
with her pathetic business

295
00:10:34,692 --> 00:10:35,926
than with her family.

296
00:10:35,961 --> 00:10:37,477
And you.

297
00:10:37,495 --> 00:10:39,879
If you call a sandwich
a "Troy-jan Horse,"

298
00:10:39,914 --> 00:10:41,716
people are going
to think there's horse in it.

299
00:10:41,732 --> 00:10:44,684
Oh, my dreams.

300
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,138
Whatever, losers.
See you never.

301
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,023
Where's Abed?

302
00:10:51,225 --> 00:10:52,293
Is anyone here?

303
00:10:52,326 --> 00:10:54,412
Hello, Abed.
Welcome to our home.

304
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:56,663
- Hello, Evil Abed.
- It's just Abed now.

305
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:58,177
After we met,
I abandoned my evil goal

306
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,033
to focus on brightening
my own timeline instead.

307
00:11:00,067 --> 00:11:01,769
- Do you live here alone?
- Yes.

308
00:11:01,802 --> 00:11:03,803
Evil Troy moved out
when I gave up the cause.

309
00:11:03,822 --> 00:11:05,405
Now he only listens
to Evil Jeff,

310
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,024
who sort of took over this year,
villain-wise.

311
00:11:07,058 --> 00:11:09,043
Jeff left Greendale and
became a scummy lawyer again,

312
00:11:09,076 --> 00:11:10,378
but the more evil he got,

313
00:11:10,412 --> 00:11:11,662
the more he became tortured
by the idea

314
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,147
that there's still
a good Jeff out there,

315
00:11:13,181 --> 00:11:14,664
being good somewhere.

316
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,732
That's why he forced me
to show him

317
00:11:15,767 --> 00:11:17,006
how to travel
between timelines.

318
00:11:17,018 --> 00:11:19,253
My God.
This is so cool.

319
00:11:19,287 --> 00:11:20,653
I know.
You have no idea

320
00:11:20,687 --> 00:11:22,523
how long I've been waiting
to talk to you about it.

321
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:24,041
Kind of a <i>Superman III</i>
meets that <i>Star Trek</i> episode

322
00:11:24,076 --> 00:11:25,509
meets season three of <i>The Cape</i>.

323
00:11:25,543 --> 00:11:27,094
- <i>The Cape</i> was cancelled.
- Not here.

324
00:11:27,129 --> 00:11:30,063
They retooled it for cable,
and it's awesome.

325
00:11:30,097 --> 00:11:31,065
Want to see it?

326
00:11:31,099 --> 00:11:32,349
Desperately.

327
00:11:32,384 --> 00:11:33,433
But I need to get back
to my timeline

328
00:11:33,467 --> 00:11:34,784
and stop Evil Jeff.

329
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,403
So I came to the only person
who could help me--me.

330
00:11:36,437 --> 00:11:37,705
I'll get you home, Abed.

331
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:41,125
But first,
you'll need some supplies.

332
00:11:46,932 --> 00:11:48,399
Everyone must be running late.

333
00:11:48,432 --> 00:11:50,584
Here, Jeffrey.
You're graduated.

334
00:11:50,619 --> 00:11:52,820
Take your precious diploma
and just go.

335
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:55,389
I cannot believe
the hurtful things

336
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,557
you said to me in my office.

337
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:57,758
I'll have you know

338
00:11:57,793 --> 00:11:59,426
that wanting a little pageantry
in your life

339
00:11:59,443 --> 00:12:02,779
isn't a crime
or a lifestyle choice.

340
00:12:06,951 --> 00:12:10,037
Okay, Annie, something
definitely weird is happening.

341
00:12:10,071 --> 00:12:12,005
No one's here,
the Dean is mad at me,

342
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:14,307
and he is never
mad at me, and--

343
00:12:14,341 --> 00:12:15,809
a third reason.

344
00:12:15,844 --> 00:12:17,677
Congratulations, Jeff.

345
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:18,846
Don't worry
about the study group.

346
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:19,945
You can talk to them later.

347
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,231
Why don't you and I
go celebrate

348
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:24,033
someplace private and boozy?

349
00:12:24,068 --> 00:12:25,402
Annie, why are you acting
like a mistress

350
00:12:25,437 --> 00:12:26,553
in a lifetime movie?

351
00:12:26,587 --> 00:12:28,338
You're funny.

352
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:31,091
Oh, sweetheart,
you dropped your phone earlier.

353
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,760
You've got a voicemail
from a guy named mark?

354
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,062
You should call him.

355
00:12:35,096 --> 00:12:36,346
Not now.

356
00:12:36,398 --> 00:12:37,480
I have to find the others
and figure this out.

357
00:12:37,515 --> 00:12:40,150
Crap.
We're losing him.

358
00:12:40,184 --> 00:12:41,134
- What?
- What?

359
00:12:41,168 --> 00:12:42,452
Who are you?

360
00:12:42,486 --> 00:12:44,154
You're me?

361
00:12:44,206 --> 00:12:46,105
- But how?
- But how?

362
00:12:46,124 --> 00:12:47,408
Enough of the pleasantries.

363
00:12:47,442 --> 00:12:48,802
I've come
from the darkest timeline

364
00:12:48,826 --> 00:12:50,827
to make sure you take that job.

365
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:52,879
It's essential to our future.

366
00:12:52,913 --> 00:12:54,597
You want it, idiot, so take it.

367
00:12:54,633 --> 00:12:55,633
I can't.

368
00:12:55,667 --> 00:12:57,116
I've spent
almost four years here,

369
00:12:57,134 --> 00:12:59,302
growing and changing
and making dioramas.

370
00:12:59,336 --> 00:13:00,336
I'm not that guy anymore.

371
00:13:00,337 --> 00:13:01,639
You're wrong.

372
00:13:01,673 --> 00:13:04,258
Greendale may have dulled
your killer instinct,

373
00:13:04,292 --> 00:13:06,594
but trust me,
it's still in you.

374
00:13:06,628 --> 00:13:10,431
It's time to leave this place
and reclaim your proper life.

375
00:13:10,465 --> 00:13:13,817
No.
Not without my study group.

376
00:13:13,851 --> 00:13:16,202
Ugh.
Now who's in a lifetime movie?

377
00:13:16,238 --> 00:13:18,154
Then I'll be rid of you
another way.

378
00:13:22,443 --> 00:13:27,581
Friendship!

379
00:13:32,671 --> 00:13:34,455
Mm.
Cold.

380
00:13:34,489 --> 00:13:36,490
Well, the subtle approach
failed.

381
00:13:36,508 --> 00:13:39,259
What's next?
Explain it slowly.

382
00:13:39,293 --> 00:13:41,846
Need some help?

383
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:44,163
Let's burn this mother down.

384
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:51,775
Jeff must be graduating about now.
I wonder if anyone's there.

385
00:13:51,895 --> 00:13:53,078
Doubt he cares.

386
00:13:53,114 --> 00:13:54,831
Pierce won't even
respond to my texts.

387
00:13:54,865 --> 00:13:57,049
I wonder what terrible things
Jeff said about him.

388
00:13:57,084 --> 00:13:58,335
I've got some guesses.

389
00:13:59,385 --> 00:14:00,452
Let me finish.

390
00:14:00,488 --> 00:14:02,455
Look, I know this may
sound crazy,

391
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:03,923
and more
than a little convenient,

392
00:14:03,957 --> 00:14:06,525
but whatever I said to you,
it wasn't me.

393
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:07,594
It was Evil Jeff.

394
00:14:07,628 --> 00:14:09,278
Come on.

395
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:10,529
Something happened
when I rolled that die.

396
00:14:10,563 --> 00:14:11,581
Something terrible.

397
00:14:11,631 --> 00:14:12,966
Something only nerds
can understand.

398
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,966
Mm-hmm.

399
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,268
You have to believe me.

400
00:14:15,302 --> 00:14:16,519
They're coming for us.

401
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:17,988
No.

402
00:14:18,038 --> 00:14:19,673
We're coming for them.

403
00:14:19,706 --> 00:14:20,657
Abed, where have you been?

404
00:14:20,691 --> 00:14:21,875
The darkest timeline.

405
00:14:21,908 --> 00:14:22,908
You guys never believe me,
so this time,

406
00:14:22,943 --> 00:14:25,195
I brought proof,
the doppeldeaner.

407
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,321
Abed brought me here
to prove to all of you--

408
00:14:28,331 --> 00:14:29,749
Whoa.

409
00:14:29,783 --> 00:14:31,017
Actually, I figured that
these paintball warping guns

410
00:14:31,052 --> 00:14:32,067
would convince you.

411
00:14:32,102 --> 00:14:33,485
Listen up, people.

412
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,671
We've got an inter-dimensional
battle on our hands.

413
00:14:34,705 --> 00:14:36,355
Our evil counterparts
are waging a war,

414
00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:38,240
and it's either us or us.

415
00:14:38,275 --> 00:14:39,643
All right.

416
00:14:39,677 --> 00:14:42,028
Let's light up
these dark suckers.

417
00:14:42,062 --> 00:14:44,397
Okay, everyone.
Stay sharp.

418
00:14:44,431 --> 00:14:47,133
If you see yourself,
warp on sight.

419
00:14:47,168 --> 00:14:50,370
I'd like to warp myself
to a dairy-free mudslide.

420
00:14:50,403 --> 00:14:51,654
That's just vodka, Shirley.

421
00:14:51,688 --> 00:14:52,638
I know what it is.

422
00:14:52,657 --> 00:14:53,789
Ah-ha.

423
00:14:53,823 --> 00:14:55,158
Pierce?

424
00:14:55,192 --> 00:14:56,192
We thought you were dead.

425
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:57,210
Hell, no.

426
00:14:57,244 --> 00:14:59,296
After I got shot,
I faked my death

427
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:00,929
to teach you all a lesson.

428
00:15:00,965 --> 00:15:02,282
Lesson about what?

429
00:15:02,316 --> 00:15:04,134
Who can remember?
It was more than a year ago.

430
00:15:04,168 --> 00:15:06,436
And yet, here you all are,

431
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,238
planning an invasion
without me.

432
00:15:08,272 --> 00:15:10,740
Again,
we thought you were dead.

433
00:15:10,774 --> 00:15:13,375
Listen, I-I can help you guys
beat the lame study group.

434
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:14,644
Just tell me how this works.

435
00:15:14,678 --> 00:15:15,711
Fine.

436
00:15:15,745 --> 00:15:17,263
It's complicated,
but basically,

437
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,049
the first person
to shoot themselves wins.

438
00:15:21,085 --> 00:15:22,568
Winner.

439
00:15:22,602 --> 00:15:24,019
Well, that bow tied itself.

440
00:15:24,054 --> 00:15:25,904
Dang, I got hair dye
on my coat.

441
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,907
Dang, it's spreading.

442
00:15:27,942 --> 00:15:28,892
Damn it, Britta.

443
00:15:28,926 --> 00:15:30,125
Did you shoot yourself too?

444
00:15:30,177 --> 00:15:31,094
Every time.

445
00:15:31,128 --> 00:15:32,095
Hey.

446
00:15:32,145 --> 00:15:34,813
Don't talk to her like that.

447
00:15:34,847 --> 00:15:35,764
Every time.

448
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:37,417
We're here.
Scatter.

449
00:15:45,058 --> 00:15:48,077
Get help.

450
00:15:48,111 --> 00:15:50,746
Can't hide forever, lame Annie.

451
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,048
Just let me shoot you.

452
00:15:52,082 --> 00:15:54,200
You'll love
the darkest timeline.

453
00:15:54,234 --> 00:15:56,086
We're sleeping with Jeff there.

454
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,604
What?
We are?

455
00:15:57,638 --> 00:15:59,438
All the time.

456
00:15:59,472 --> 00:16:02,509
And he loves it.

457
00:16:04,211 --> 00:16:06,462
Nobody sleeps with Jeff.

458
00:16:06,496 --> 00:16:09,048
Not even me.

459
00:16:11,568 --> 00:16:12,985
I've been counting bullets.

460
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:14,019
One of us is out.

461
00:16:14,054 --> 00:16:15,721
- Is it you?
- Yes.

462
00:16:15,755 --> 00:16:17,307
Why would you tell me that?

463
00:16:17,308 --> 00:16:19,259
To sound intimidating.

464
00:16:21,423 --> 00:16:27,644
Oh. Almost worked.

465
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:30,403
Ballin'.

466
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:35,924
Okay.
Only Evil Jeff is left.

467
00:16:35,975 --> 00:16:37,177
You've got to take him out.

468
00:16:37,211 --> 00:16:38,311
Why don't I just give him
what he wants?

469
00:16:38,345 --> 00:16:39,696
What?
You can't give up now.

470
00:16:39,746 --> 00:16:41,563
- Why not?
- Because it's not real.

471
00:16:41,599 --> 00:16:42,782
Look around, Jeff.

472
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:43,966
Haven't you noticed
the vending machines

473
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,753
are full of meats
and hard-boiled eggs?

474
00:16:46,787 --> 00:16:47,821
Or that
all the background students

475
00:16:47,855 --> 00:16:50,273
are attractive women?

476
00:16:50,323 --> 00:16:51,790
Hi.

477
00:16:51,826 --> 00:16:53,125
Yeah.

478
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:55,245
This is a world you've created
in your own mind.

479
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:56,796
The real battle is within.

480
00:16:56,813 --> 00:16:58,297
You're afraid to graduate
because you think

481
00:16:58,315 --> 00:17:00,100
Greendale has
changed you too much.

482
00:17:00,134 --> 00:17:01,533
So part of you
wants Evil Jeff to win,

483
00:17:01,568 --> 00:17:02,869
because then you could
go backwards

484
00:17:02,903 --> 00:17:04,237
and pretend you're the same guy
you were four years ago.

485
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:06,055
But you're not.
You're stronger.

486
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:08,074
You're better.
You have friends.

487
00:17:08,108 --> 00:17:09,608
No, screw that.
You have a family.

488
00:17:09,643 --> 00:17:11,478
Wait.

489
00:17:11,511 --> 00:17:12,612
If this is all in my mind,

490
00:17:12,645 --> 00:17:14,047
then I don't really need
to fight him.

491
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,465
Don't logic this one
away from me.

492
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,951
We finally figured out a way
to make paintball cool again.

493
00:17:23,441 --> 00:17:24,390
Hey, handsome.

494
00:17:48,632 --> 00:17:50,182
On second thought,

495
00:17:50,217 --> 00:17:51,567
who needs to roll a die?

496
00:17:51,602 --> 00:17:53,036
And who cares if we have soda?

497
00:17:53,069 --> 00:17:54,820
As long as you guys
are with me,

498
00:17:54,855 --> 00:17:57,056
I have everything I need
to graduate.

499
00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:00,093
Yeah.
Forget soda.

500
00:18:00,126 --> 00:18:04,079
Friends, Greendalians,
human beings,

501
00:18:04,114 --> 00:18:05,898
we are gathered here today
to honor

502
00:18:05,932 --> 00:18:10,537
that sacred and eternal bond
between a student and his Dean.

503
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:13,839
Neither time nor distance
nor screening one's calls

504
00:18:13,874 --> 00:18:17,259
could ever sever what
nature herself has ordained.

505
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,510
When two men are drawn--

506
00:18:18,546 --> 00:18:19,612
I'll take it from here, Craig.

507
00:18:19,645 --> 00:18:23,282
Fair enough.
I was reaching.

508
00:18:23,317 --> 00:18:25,868
Three and a half years ago,
when I came to Greendale,

509
00:18:25,903 --> 00:18:28,203
I met six
very important people.

510
00:18:28,239 --> 00:18:30,423
Ooh.
Burn on Britta.

511
00:18:30,441 --> 00:18:31,490
Sorry, seven.

512
00:18:31,525 --> 00:18:34,993
And meeting these people
changed my life.

513
00:18:35,028 --> 00:18:36,897
Yep.

514
00:18:39,215 --> 00:18:41,334
I'm sorry.
I-I don't know what to say.

515
00:18:42,353 --> 00:18:43,769
- Yeah, okay.
- Whatever.

516
00:18:43,804 --> 00:18:45,521
I'm so used to being the guy

517
00:18:45,556 --> 00:18:47,557
who can talk his way
out of anything,

518
00:18:47,607 --> 00:18:51,611
but what do you say
when you don't want a way out?

519
00:18:51,628 --> 00:18:56,298
What you all have done
for me is indescribable.

520
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,549
It's unbelievable.

521
00:18:57,585 --> 00:19:02,105
And my love for you
is immeasurable,

522
00:19:02,155 --> 00:19:06,643
even when you split it
seven ways.

523
00:19:06,676 --> 00:19:09,828
Well said, Jeffrey.

524
00:19:09,863 --> 00:19:12,582
If anyone here
should have just cause

525
00:19:12,615 --> 00:19:15,050
why Jeffrey Tobias Winger
should not be graduated,

526
00:19:15,102 --> 00:19:16,685
speak now
or forever--

527
00:19:18,105 --> 00:19:19,305
Pierce.

528
00:19:19,338 --> 00:19:20,440
You don't have to do this.

529
00:19:20,473 --> 00:19:21,441
I'm ready to graduate.

530
00:19:21,474 --> 00:19:23,192
Yeah?

531
00:19:23,227 --> 00:19:24,943
Well, I'm ready
to graduate first.

532
00:19:24,979 --> 00:19:27,846
Seems oddly appropriate.

533
00:19:27,865 --> 00:19:29,848
Congratulations, Pierce.

534
00:19:35,489 --> 00:19:37,205
Perfect.

535
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,208
So what's next
for Jeffrey Winger?

536
00:19:39,242 --> 00:19:41,877
I'm thinking I might look
into some small local firms.

537
00:19:41,912 --> 00:19:43,796
I'm going to use my big mouth
to help the little guy.

538
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:44,881
Aww.

539
00:19:44,914 --> 00:19:45,999
Plus, if I stay in town,

540
00:19:46,032 --> 00:19:47,750
I can pop by any time I want.

541
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,036
You know, just to settle
any group arguments

542
00:19:50,054 --> 00:19:51,287
about who misses me the most.

543
00:19:51,322 --> 00:19:52,904
Oh--

544
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,222
What do you think?

545
00:19:54,258 --> 00:19:55,865
- To Jeff.
- To Jeffrey.

547
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:05,939
Welcome back.

548
00:20:06,058 --> 00:20:07,710
We've got a jam-packed show,
so let's get started.

549
00:20:07,755 --> 00:20:08,704
Today, as always,

550
00:20:08,756 --> 00:20:09,957
we'll be visited once again

551
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:11,156
by Greendale's king
and supreme lord master,

552
00:20:11,174 --> 00:20:12,509
Dean Chang.

553
00:20:12,542 --> 00:20:14,542
Looks like he'll be
talking about squash this time.

554
00:20:14,615 --> 00:20:16,065
Oh, I'm super excited for that.

555
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:18,250
And not only
because it's mandatory.

556
00:20:18,285 --> 00:20:20,036
But first, we'll take a spin
around the timeline map

557
00:20:20,069 --> 00:20:21,487
and find out what's happening
in the universes

558
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:23,239
that parallel ours.

559
00:20:25,174 --> 00:20:26,259
Thanks, us.

560
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:27,544
I'm standing here
in timeline five,

561
00:20:27,577 --> 00:20:28,978
where things
are pretty much normal.

562
00:20:29,012 --> 00:20:30,012
Normal?

563
00:20:30,047 --> 00:20:32,015
Troy, people are on fire
in Nairobi.

564
00:20:32,048 --> 00:20:33,883
You call that normal?

565
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:36,102
I've become much more conscious
of world issues

566
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:39,471
since Troy and I decided to give
our baby an African name.

567
00:20:39,522 --> 00:20:41,691
Isn't that right, Chewbacca?

568
00:20:41,724 --> 00:20:43,259
It means,
"He who hunts bounties."

569
00:20:43,277 --> 00:20:44,730
Back to you.

570
00:20:46,195 --> 00:20:48,998
Wow, it sounds like things are
really heating up in Nairobi.

571
00:20:49,032 --> 00:20:50,032
That's nothing compared
to the fire

572
00:20:50,067 --> 00:20:52,317
in our studio audience.

573
00:20:52,353 --> 00:20:53,569
Hey, idiots.

574
00:20:53,604 --> 00:20:54,636
How many times have I told you,

575
00:20:54,672 --> 00:20:56,072
the show doesn't really exist.

576
00:20:56,105 --> 00:20:58,074
No one's watching.

577
00:20:58,107 --> 00:20:59,826
Duh-doy.
We know.

578
00:20:59,876 --> 00:21:01,076
Yeah, we're just
messing around.

579
00:21:01,111 --> 00:21:02,077
See you at lunch, Evil Jeff.

580
00:21:02,112 --> 00:21:03,473
See you at lunch.
