1
00:00:01,585 --> 00:00:04,713
- Troy and Abed back from summer.
- Troy and Abed back from summer.

2
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,634
Wait a minute.
Something's changed.

3
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:12,221
There's 12 additional thumbtacks on
that board. They're driving me crazy.

4
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:15,724
No, I meant this.
Trying out the hipster look.

5
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,977
It's cool, but also not.

6
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:20,562
Hey, guys, have a good summer?

7
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,397
Take them off.

8
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:26,235
Happy first day of school.

9
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:30,906
Good morning. I brought brownies.

10
00:00:33,242 --> 00:00:35,702
Congratulations, it's me.

11
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,916
I see we've all reinvented ourselves
over the summer.

12
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,001
A little late
to the hipster party much?

13
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:44,920
A little much on the "much" much?

14
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:48,131
We should get to class.
Where's Pierce?

15
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:50,050
- I don't know.
- Hey-o.

16
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:53,387
Sorry, I'm late.

17
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:56,807
Damn Mexican cleaning woman
did a cha-cha on my glasses...

18
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:58,600
so I gotta wear this old pair.

19
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,356
Abed. Abed.

20
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,775
- Abed.
- Yeah?

21
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,378
- Did you go to your happy place?
- Yeah.

22
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:11,071
Did you envision a babbling brook
like I described?

23
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:13,967
I started with a babbling brook, then
layered in elements from our world.

24
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:16,785
I'm sure fans of the brook
will complain, but it was limiting.

25
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,121
- Keep it simple.
- It was a babbling brook.

26
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:21,456
Okay. Here's the deal, Jessica Biel.

27
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:24,459
The first day of senior year
is emotional for everyone...

28
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,504
so I hereby therapize you
to go to your happy place...

29
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,923
whenever you feel stressed.

30
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:33,260
- I found my lucky notebook.
- Found my lucky charm.

31
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:36,138
Abed, you ready for our last
first day of school?

32
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:38,974
Are you ready, buddy?

33
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,269
I just need a minute.

34
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:46,648
This is my show It's about me.

35
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,319
And all my friends on Abed TV.

36
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:53,071
My happy place Nothing but fun.

37
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:57,326
Nothing but laughs and smiles
And then we rerun.

38
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:02,331
For those times
When life's too hard to face

39
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:07,002
I'll find some happy
In my happy place

40
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,398
Abed's Happy Community College
Show is filmed...

41
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:12,299
before a live audience
inside of my head.

42
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:18,347
I can't believe we're getting
into this class.

43
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,682
I can't believe
there's a History of Ice Cream.

44
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,517
Seniors.

45
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:23,976
Hey.

46
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,979
There they are.

47
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:28,023
I missed you guys.

48
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,942
- Seniors.
- Speaking of seniors...

49
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,528
I've decided
I'm gonna do senioritis this year.

50
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,197
You know, just hanging out...

51
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:39,743
and blowing off classes,
pulling pranks, not saying my G's.

52
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:41,536
I'll pull some pranks with you.

53
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:45,207
Okay. Or Jeff or whoever. You know,
whoever's around, whatever.

54
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:48,260
Abed, after class we're still doing
our first-day-of-school tradition?

55
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,004
- You know it.
- We make wishes in the fountain.

56
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,340
Fellas, I hate to tell you,
wishes aren't real.

57
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:56,343
If you want something bad,
you have to work for it.

58
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:58,595
- Or use a spell.
- All of our wishes come true.

59
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,723
Last year, Troy wished
we got Bin Laden and the Dorito taco.

60
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,475
But Obama got credit for both.

61
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,519
Could you wish for Jeff
to be on time?

62
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:08,021
No. No wasting wishes
on impossibilities.

63
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,993
We have to make this year count,
especially since it's the last one.

64
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:16,071
Oh, no. Is all this for
The History of Ice Cream?

65
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,407
Overbooked.
It's first come, first serve now.

66
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,992
- Just like real ice cream.
- Guys, over here.

67
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,369
- Oh, Jeffrey.
- Jeff.

68
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,917
Jeff, I can't believe
that you came early.

69
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,212
Don't you read Garrett's Twitter?
He posted a crisis alert about it.

70
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:35,090
I came early to save seats.
Oh, you know what, girls?

71
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:39,010
I gave you the old flyer.
Instagram for Besties is in Room 44.

72
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:43,765
Showing up early, helping others,
sending girls away?

73
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,101
Could this be
a whole new Jeff Winger?

74
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:47,686
Don't ruin it by approving it.

75
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,067
Oh, so that's progressed.

76
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:57,612
I mean, it's progressed,
but it hasn't "progressed" progressed.

77
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:58,904
It's progressive.

78
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,866
- Good luck, Troy.
- Hey.

79
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:02,659
You can't just walk in here.

80
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:06,371
I've been pissing in jars for an hour
trying to keep this seat.

81
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:07,789
Leonard, keep those...

82
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:11,960
Yes. All right, all right, all right.
Simmer dean.

83
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,546
This can't be good.
He's dressed as himself.

84
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,591
Greendale's registration system
has been hacked.

85
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:20,844
That's right. Someone hacked
into the supply closet...

86
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:24,139
and counterfeited these
History of Ice Cream admission cards.

87
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,976
Whoever did this is very good.

88
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,479
There is only one fair way
to solve this.

89
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:35,108
So follow me to...

90
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

91
00:04:57,756 --> 00:05:00,967
the Hunger Deans.

92
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,511
Thank you. Thank you.

93
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:05,764
There are 35 tests of strength
and agility.

94
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:08,600
The winner of each one
of these contests...

95
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:11,102
will be awarded a red rubber ball.

96
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,146
No ball, no ice cream.

97
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,857
And these
are impossible to counterfeit...

98
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:20,362
because each one has been marked
by my distinct bite print.

99
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,364
- Oh, Lord, no.
- Yeah.

100
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:25,826
We need to take this class. It's the only
history credit this semester.

101
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,370
Whatevs. We'll take it next semes.

102
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:29,871
Ter. Semester.

103
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,623
But I need it now.

104
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:34,417
Okay.
I took some extra classes online...

105
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,212
and I'm one history credit away
from graduating.

106
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,172
Jeff, you're graduating early?

107
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:42,217
Well, graduating after 30
can't be characterised as early.

108
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:45,178
- When were you gonna tell us, Jeff?
- I was working on a speech.

109
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,305
Believe me, it tied in a lot of things.

110
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,724
There was a lot of resolutions
and epiphanies.

111
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,685
It would have gone down
a lot better...

112
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:54,271
after we had taken
the ice cream class together.

113
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:57,065
That's why you held our seats,
your own selfish reasons.

114
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,109
No, I want us
to take the class together.

115
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:02,070
I just want it to be the last class
we take together.

116
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,574
- I should've phrased that differently.
- Win your ball. What do I care?

117
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,826
I've got a senior prank to pull.
Shirley.

118
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:12,414
Abed, ready to make some wishes?
Make chocolate hot dogs a reality?

119
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:15,041
Go with Britta.
I'll just hang out here and watch.

120
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,085
- Really? Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

121
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,379
F-I-N-E or F-Y-N-E?

122
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:22,215
We made one of them a code
for "not fine."

123
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,259
F-Y-N-E.

124
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:25,886
Okay, he's fine. Let's go.

125
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:27,721
See you around, old Jeff.

126
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:31,016
No, new Jeff. New Jeff does not
just look out for himself.

127
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,184
New Jeff is gonna win
seven red balls.

128
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:36,646
Because he is not gonna take that
class unless you guys are with me.

129
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:39,608
Look, we're gonna have to leave
this place sometime.

130
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,694
Like an ice cream cone
melting in the sun...

131
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:45,238
our time here can't last forever.

132
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,282
That was part of the speech
I was writing.

133
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:53,121
- Hey, guys. What's going on?
- Oh, just making plans for the future.

134
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,831
Can't stay at Greendale forever.

135
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,876
Hey, is mine different than yours?

136
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:04,299
Look out below.
Coming in for a Ian-dean.

137
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:07,552
Amelia Earhart?

138
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:11,264
Close. I am America's sexiest aviator,
Leo DiCaprio.

139
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,143
And just as his character
lost his mind...

140
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,812
so have I lost
your student records.

141
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,982
What? I can't believe it.

142
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,985
Yeah, Amelia Earhart
would have been faster.

143
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:28,156
As you know, our student records
are stored on a Microsoft Paint file...

144
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,660
which I was assured
was future-proof.

145
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:35,830
Meanwhile, our extended warranty
is not being honoured...

146
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,959
by the restaurant
that used to be Circuit City.

147
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,586
But I think the fairest way
to handle this...

148
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,965
is to have everyone
repeat the last three years.

149
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,633
You can't be serious.

150
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:48,760
In-dean, I am.

151
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:51,972
We're gonna be here forever.

152
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:56,226
Forever.

153
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:58,979
I'm gonna stay in here forever.

154
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:06,611
Gentlemen and ladies.

155
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:10,115
My first red ball is way up high.

156
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:14,494
To touch my ball, first touch the sky.

157
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:15,954
Go.

158
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:21,042
- Give it up, Leonard.
- I'm gonna eat your ice cream, Winger.

159
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:25,130
- You? You're premed.
- I want ice cream.

160
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,215
Yeah, well,
I wanna graduate with dignity.

161
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:30,218
Come over.

162
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:33,972
Jeff's really going after that ball.

163
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,850
There's gotta be a joke in there
somewhere.

164
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:39,811
That's my first ball. New Jeff.

165
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:42,814
Give me a minute.
Give me a minute.

166
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,941
This one! This one!

167
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:46,901
No.

168
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:51,906
If we're doing the first three years
over again, I could change majors.

169
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,492
I've always been curious
about forensics.

170
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,578
Did you know you could major
in antics?

171
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,205
You need a tomfoolery prereq.
They waive it for women.

172
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:03,877
This is lunacy. We are not gonna
start over as freshmen.

173
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:06,880
Hey, there's a freshman mixer tonight.
Are you guys freshmen?

174
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:08,840
We can be.

175
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,647
This prank is amazing.
He's gonna come in here later...

176
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,734
and have the creepy feeling
someone was in here.

177
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:30,945
- We should go before we get caught.
- Aren't we gonna do something?

178
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,697
Do something?

179
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:37,702
All right. A prank on a prank.

180
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:41,915
Let's move everything on his desk
over an inch except his stapler.

181
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:45,293
Then he'll think we moved his stapler.
There's so many levels to this.

182
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,462
How about we fill his car
with popcorn?

183
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,422
That sounds messy.

184
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,300
That sounds messy.

185
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,804
Okay. Keys. Keys.

186
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,806
Okay, I'm the dean.

187
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,308
I come into my office,
turn on the light.

188
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,603
"Oh, my, did my stapler grow legs
and move?"

189
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:06,856
Then come over here for coffee.

190
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:12,153
I would hide my keys in...

191
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,831
- Heels.
- You got skills.

192
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,501
Look who got his ball.

193
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:29,254
Not my ball, your ball.
I wanted you guys to see it.

194
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,506
- New Jeff.
- Is that blood on your shirt?

195
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,675
Oh, no, it's cool. It's Leonard's.

196
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,510
Two balls.

197
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:41,516
This is gonna be so good
when I finally get it.

198
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,229
It's a little weird doing this
without Abed.

199
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:49,691
Come on, it'll be fun.
I'll put my Britta twist on it.

200
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,528
I got skills. I got skills.

201
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,239
- Sorry.
- Let's get this started.

202
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:59,033
We always do the first one together.
One, two, three.

203
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,161
- A great school year.
- A thousand wishes.

204
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:02,704
Great school year?

205
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:06,040
- First wish is always for 1000 wishes.
- But we have all these coins.

206
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:09,711
- Yeah, but the coins aren't the wishes.
- Oh, I didn't know that.

207
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:13,673
I wish for Britta
to have 499 of my remaining wishes.

208
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,216
Thank you.

209
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,386
- I wish to end all wars.
- That's another rule.

210
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,681
No wishes containing the word "all."
Guaranteed ironic consequences.

211
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:23,892
I don't think
anyone's gonna miss wars.

212
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:27,312
Star Wars, thumb wars.
Wow, Storage Wars.

213
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:28,897
Fine.

214
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,733
- You can't get in.
- I'm taking that penny back.

215
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,752
I already told you,
the pennies aren't wishes.

216
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,070
You can't flip a wish.
That's ridiculous.

217
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,698
- Your rules are ridiculous.
- They're Abed's rules.

218
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,159
They're awesome.
They always work.

219
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:43,328
Well, Abed's not here...

220
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,537
so unwish.

221
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,540
- You can't do that.
- I just did.

222
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,042
- Unwish.
- No. Rewish.

223
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,334
- Unwish.
- Un-unwish.

224
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,378
- Give me! Unwish!
- No!

225
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,089
No! Oh, I'm sorry.

226
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,591
What...? You're helping me!

227
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,843
You're helping. I like it.

228
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,135
Unwish!

229
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:02,555
- Unwish!
- Why does this feel good?

230
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:07,769
Stupid, selfish Jeff coming here
ruining our senior year.

231
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,562
Great, my G's are back.

232
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,941
It's crummy Jeff is leaving early,
but we're all graduating eventually.

233
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:17,111
But why the rush? What, so Jeff can
run off and be a gross lawyer again?

234
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,947
Troy and Abed start drinking coffee?

235
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,115
I become a boring
hospital administrator?

236
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,743
- Who wants to do that?
- You do. Right?

237
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:25,995
Hospital administration.

238
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:29,791
Can't wait to be buried alive under
a pile of paperwork and bedpans...

239
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,460
trying to summon the courage
to ask out Dr. Patel...

240
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,296
the gorgeous neurosurgeon
who doesn't know I exist.

241
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,965
This isn't a conversation, is it?

242
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:40,468
The sad, slow march
toward death begins.

243
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:44,555
Senioritis.

244
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,267
Ready, set...

245
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:54,941
Third ball.

246
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:01,823
Fourth ball.

247
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,500
Well, well, well.

248
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,837
Looks like someone
wants to be a hero.

249
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,839
A big man.
A huge, throbbing, sweaty...

250
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,341
I wanna get my history credit
and get out of here.

251
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,510
And I just need to know
how bad you want it.

252
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,722
Next competition will be particularly
difficult for some of you...

253
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:28,474
because it requires
complete emotional commitment.

254
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:33,062
The tango. I will be the judge.
There can only be one winner...

255
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,981
so choose your partners wisely.

256
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:37,442
Come on, Winger.
Water under the bridge, right?

257
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,861
- Partners?
- Sorry, my dance card's full.

258
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:45,116
For my partner
in the tango competition, I choose...

259
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:47,869
the dean.

260
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,704
The fountain works.

261
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,883
All these balls.
I'm so close, I can taste it.

262
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:10,350
Pierce, only you could turn
a freshman mixer into a disaster!

263
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,852
I was this close
to getting those two girls.

264
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:16,564
Look how close you're holding your
fingers together. That's your penis.

265
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:19,441
Guys, great news.

266
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:23,321
After just one forensics class, I found
a way to retrieve our student records.

267
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:26,240
It turns out there's a backup,
and it's in this safe.

268
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:36,084
- I have a theory, dean.
- Do tell.

269
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,544
I don't think you want me
to graduate.

270
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,505
Don't be absurd, Jeffrey.

271
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,757
I want success
for all Greendale students.

272
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,051
Oh, really? Then answer me this.

273
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:47,220
What happened
to the other history class?

274
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:48,930
What other history class?

275
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:53,267
The second history class,
the one that actually taught history...

276
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:57,105
that disappeared from the schedule
after I took summer classes.

277
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,190
You're telling yourself a fantasy.

278
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:01,901
Who really made those counterfeited
ice cream tickets?

279
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:04,404
Who's so good
that they got your handwriting...

280
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,614
with its hearts and flourishes?

281
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,324
Oh, God, you're right.

282
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:11,285
I can't let you go, Jeffrey.
You weren't supposed to compete.

283
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,621
You were supposed to walk away
with the group.

284
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,374
You can't not get rid of me
that easily.

285
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,794
Oh, God. Why'd I make it feats
of strength and grace?

286
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,964
It's... It's as if I wanted you to win.

287
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,716
But that can't be true.

288
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,595
Smile.

289
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,389
Best friends.

290
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:40,398
So let's hug it out. Okay.

291
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,443
Here. One more ball to go.

292
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:46,821
But it's another dance contest,
so I think I got it.

293
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:49,449
What's wrong with Abed?

294
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,623
Don't. We're redoing our first
three years. That's what I want.

295
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:01,502
It's okay, Abed. Here's a trick I use
when I feel overwhelmed.

296
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:06,090
Just imagine a happy place
and then go there.

297
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,679
Greendale Babies.

298
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,182
They're happy and they're free.

299
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,517
Greendale Babies.

300
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,603
Fun for you and me.

301
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:20,938
Greendale Babies forever.

302
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,024
Greendale Babies will be right back.

303
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,650
Forever.

304
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,823
Pierce, what did you do to Abed?

305
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:32,783
Gay balls.

306
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,160
Nailed it.

307
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,122
- Don't ask.
- Don't tell.

308
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,708
Poor Abed.
Is he in his imagination emporium?

309
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,544
Dreamatorium?
No, this seems like something new.

310
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:47,215
Abed was having some anxiety
about all the changes this year...

311
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:50,718
so I may have told him
to go to a happy place in his mind.

312
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,513
You told him to go somewhere
in his mind?

313
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,348
Do you realise who you told that to?

314
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,227
The last competition to win a red ball
begins in one minute.

315
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,480
Honestly, Jeff, you can go.
No one will think you're selfish.

316
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,400
- This looks bad.
- I wish I hadn't broken Abed.

317
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:09,987
There is one thing we could try.

318
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,656
Oh, okay.

319
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,165
Hey, let's play pretend.

320
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,084
Yeah, we could be cowboys.

321
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:24,585
We could be spacemen.

322
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,591
That's right, baby Pierce.
We can play forever.

323
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,345
- It's not working.
- What's not working?

324
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:37,932
Okay, contestants,
final competition begins right now.

325
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,268
God, I hate new Jeff.

326
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:45,231
Hey, guys, I have something to say.

327
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,108
Like always.

328
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,235
I was just outside Babyville.

329
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:52,738
- There's nothing outside Babyville.
- You know what? There is.

330
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:56,867
And it was scary,
because change is always scary.

331
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:00,496
But then I thought of you guys,
and I wasn't so scared.

332
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,748
Abed, when you brought
this group together...

333
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,127
you changed our lives.
But then we changed each other.

334
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,713
And we're gonna keep changing
in unexpected ways.

335
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:12,466
We'll still be friends even if we don't
all become professors at Greendale...

336
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:13,918
blind/blonde marathon up next

337
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,094
open a restaurant...

338
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:17,826
or move into the same
apartment building after Pierce dies.

339
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:22,643
And even if we go somewhere,
we're not going anywhere.

340
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,450
That was a killer speech, Jeff.

341
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:40,161
I didn't say anything.
I literally just walked up.

342
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,830
I made the speech for you.
It hit all the right notes.

343
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,601
I was trying to hang on to this moment
because I was afraid of the future.

344
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,918
But then I realised
all of this was once the future.

345
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:52,256
It was different from what I'd known
before, and it was happening so fast.

346
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:55,468
But in the end, or in the now, I guess,
it turned out great.

347
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,013
And just like ice cream, we've melted
together and made a new...

348
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,390
I just had to run the scenario
to figure it out.

349
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,684
- Sorry I missed the fountain.
- It's okay.

350
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,854
Britta introduced a new rule:
No rules.

351
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,146
We can discuss it.

352
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:11,317
When they were incepting,
I got their balls.

353
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:14,654
- Hey. That... Over there.
- Come on, get out of the way.

354
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,864
Now that we're out
of History of Ice Cream...

355
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,533
I can finally take
Advanced Claims Denial.

356
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,619
You should take forensics.

357
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:27,583
Can somebody tell me
what the hell we just did?

358
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:31,379
Jeffrey. Jeffrey, wait.

359
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:34,548
What are you...? You smell
like the floor of a movie theatre.

360
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,968
Yeah, but not for the usual reasons.
I have had the worst day.

361
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,013
Our dance photo didn't come out,
someone moved my stapler...

362
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,474
and, worst of all, I hurt you.

363
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:47,061
You'll be happy to know that we'll
be offering another history class...

364
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:48,562
because I care about you.

365
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,732
Not because I found out
if we don't offer a real history class...

366
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,693
we'll lose $40,000 in grant money.

367
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:57,071
Thank you, dean. You didn't have
to come all this way to tell me that.

368
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,907
Oh, no, it wasn't a problem.
It's on my way.

369
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,412
Tell me you're breaking into
that condo.

370
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:07,540
No, I bought it.
Now we'll be like almost roomies.

371
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,333
Oh, good, you got wine.

372
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,752
I've got Friends With Benefits.
No subtext.

373
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,588
I don't know why I was so worried
about change.

374
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,591
This year's gonna be great.
I'll be right over.

375
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:37,903
"Hello. My name is Kevin.
I have Changnesia."

376
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,959
- Sure this will work?
- Guaranteed to. It's an antic.

377
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:55,963
Not so fast, you two.

378
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,299
- Get ready to run.
- In these heels?

379
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:02,553
Where'd you girls get those dresses?
They're fabulous.

380
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,306
They're charming.

381
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,893
- Not so fast, mister.
- Excuse you?

382
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:11,312
Excuse me.
Thank you, sir. Not for you.

383
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:14,106
- Hello, it's Britta.
- Okay, I know a man when I see one.

384
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,984
Oh, Lord, no

384
00:21:17,305 --> 00:21:23,694
