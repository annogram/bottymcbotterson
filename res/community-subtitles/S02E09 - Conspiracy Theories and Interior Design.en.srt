1
00:00:11,648 --> 00:00:13,885
Agnes, cancel my appointments.

2
00:00:13,886 --> 00:00:15,268
What appointments?

3
00:00:16,315 --> 00:00:17,801
Wishful thinking.

4
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:20,360
It's called alternative energy,

5
00:00:20,361 --> 00:00:22,635
the key to a brighter tomorrow.

6
00:00:29,841 --> 00:00:31,961
Notice all the animals
wearing sunglasses.

7
00:00:31,962 --> 00:00:33,286
Because it's a brighter tomorrow.

8
00:00:33,991 --> 00:00:35,002
Yeah.

9
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:38,123
My boys are in elementary school.

10
00:00:38,124 --> 00:00:40,156
They don't make nearly
as many dioramas as we do.

11
00:00:40,157 --> 00:00:42,388
The whole environmental club
is making them for green week.

12
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:43,961
And this afternoon in the cafeteria,

13
00:00:43,962 --> 00:00:45,990
we're having a bio-diorama-rama.

14
00:00:45,991 --> 00:00:49,082
I heard one kid made a diorama
about a world without dioramas.

15
00:00:50,999 --> 00:00:53,140
It's still cool if I sleep
at your place tonight, right?

16
00:00:53,141 --> 00:00:55,487
Totally. Hey, since we're
both done with classes,

17
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:57,409
- we can start the sleepover now.
- Let's get in our pajamas

18
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:59,025
- and build a blanket fort.
- Let's do it.

19
00:00:59,091 --> 00:01:01,402
A blanket fort. Wow!

20
00:01:01,403 --> 00:01:03,051
You can come hang out in it
with us later if you want.

21
00:01:03,052 --> 00:01:04,889
Uh, thanks, but I think
I'll find something

22
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,687
- more grown-up to do.
- Hmm. Okay.

23
00:01:07,688 --> 00:01:10,016
Enjoy eating fiber and
watching The Mentalist.

24
00:01:10,228 --> 00:01:11,565
Britta, that wasn't nice.

25
00:01:11,566 --> 00:01:13,603
I'm sorry, Shirley,
but who wants to hang out

26
00:01:13,604 --> 00:01:16,918
in a blanket fort with
grown men in tiny underoos?

27
00:01:16,919 --> 00:01:19,264
Hello! So... Jeffrey,

28
00:01:19,265 --> 00:01:21,945
I was just looking over
your class schedule.

29
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:23,266
- Why?
- Uh...

30
00:01:23,267 --> 00:01:25,114
Maybe it was a random spot-check.

31
00:01:25,115 --> 00:01:27,234
Maybe it was a specific spot-check.

32
00:01:27,235 --> 00:01:29,651
Maybe I'm making a scrapbook.

33
00:01:29,652 --> 00:01:31,050
The point is

34
00:01:31,051 --> 00:01:34,221
you will not be receiving credit
for your independent study:

35
00:01:34,222 --> 00:01:37,148
Conspiracy theories in US history.

36
00:01:37,149 --> 00:01:38,196
What? Why not?

37
00:01:38,197 --> 00:01:40,198
Because the class doesn't exist.

38
00:01:40,199 --> 00:01:44,059
And neither does the teacher...
Professor Professorson?

39
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,207
What? That's his name!

40
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:46,407
- Oh...
- It's Dutch.

41
00:01:46,408 --> 00:01:50,044
- I think it means professor.
- I think it means poppycock.

42
00:01:50,045 --> 00:01:52,503
The ultimate Jeff Winger
blow-off class...

43
00:01:52,504 --> 00:01:54,343
The one that doesn't exist.

44
00:01:54,344 --> 00:01:57,819
Now I have to audit an
entire system for shenanigans,

45
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,180
which means... bye-bye weekends.

46
00:02:00,181 --> 00:02:01,897
Bye-bye writing at Starbucks

47
00:02:01,898 --> 00:02:04,871
till a certain persian barista
asks me about my novel.

48
00:02:04,872 --> 00:02:05,831
God, Jeff!

49
00:02:05,832 --> 00:02:07,650
It's one thing to blow off
regular classes,

50
00:02:07,651 --> 00:02:10,712
but this devalues all the credits
I work very hard for.

51
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:11,925
- Mm-hmm.
- Can I defend myself

52
00:02:11,926 --> 00:02:13,376
and say this is nuts?

53
00:02:13,475 --> 00:02:14,862
I've been meeting with this professor

54
00:02:14,863 --> 00:02:17,920
in his office every Wednesday
all semester.

55
00:02:17,921 --> 00:02:19,887
Professor Professorson.

56
00:02:19,888 --> 00:02:21,359
- Yes!
- Really?

57
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,683
You're gonna commit to this?

58
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,088
Commit to what... Reality?

59
00:02:24,089 --> 00:02:26,188
Okay, then, please... lead me

60
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:28,618
- to Professor Professorson.
- Gladly.

61
00:02:28,619 --> 00:02:30,797
- This I gotta see.
- I have always dreamt

62
00:02:30,798 --> 00:02:32,256
of playing charades
with you, Jeffrey...

63
00:02:32,257 --> 00:02:34,861
Just not like this, not on dry land.

00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:07,918
Oh, man!

68
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,164
You thinking what I'm thinking?

69
00:03:21,217 --> 00:03:22,615
We're too big for this, aren't we?

70
00:03:22,616 --> 00:03:23,407
Yeah.

71
00:03:24,575 --> 00:03:26,243
But if we went two pillows
higher in the corner,

72
00:03:26,244 --> 00:03:27,579
we could vault the ceiling...

73
00:03:27,776 --> 00:03:29,198
Bump up the square footage.

74
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:31,913
Make this a blanket fort for men.

Well, here we are.

78
00:03:40,446 --> 00:03:42,981
Professor Professorson's office.

79
00:03:46,566 --> 00:03:47,621
Oh!

80
00:03:48,587 --> 00:03:49,766
Oh...

81
00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:53,492
I don't know what's goin' on.

82
00:03:53,493 --> 00:03:54,750
You guys have to believe me.

83
00:03:54,751 --> 00:03:57,372
I have spent a whole year
studying conspiracy theories

84
00:03:57,373 --> 00:03:59,509
with Professor Professorson right here!

85
00:04:00,012 --> 00:04:01,942
Wait! Of course!

86
00:04:02,234 --> 00:04:03,951
Conspiracy theories.

87
00:04:04,068 --> 00:04:05,425
This is a test.

88
00:04:05,513 --> 00:04:08,009
He's teaching me about real conspiracies

89
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:09,698
by erasing his existence!

90
00:04:09,768 --> 00:04:12,096
Oh, my God.
Do you know what this means?

91
00:04:13,024 --> 00:04:15,491
That's how stupid Jeff
thinks other people are.

92
00:04:15,492 --> 00:04:18,099
I always knew you were lazy,
but I didn't realize

93
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,310
that you would stoop
to such pathetic lies!

94
00:04:21,016 --> 00:04:24,415
One man's lies are
another man's truth...

95
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:25,969
Wouldn't you say, Jeff?

96
00:04:26,008 --> 00:04:28,142
I'm sorry. And who are you?

97
00:04:29,214 --> 00:04:31,549
I'm Professor Professorson.

98
00:04:32,369 --> 00:04:34,095
Ha. Wow, you...you really
had me going there

99
00:04:34,096 --> 00:04:35,208
for a second, professor.

100
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:36,485
I thought I was going insane.

101
00:04:36,486 --> 00:04:37,726
Precisely.

102
00:04:37,925 --> 00:04:41,132
An actual conspiracy to
round out your education

103
00:04:41,133 --> 00:04:43,786
in conspiracies and theories thereof.

104
00:04:44,209 --> 00:04:47,593
Your real name...
is Professor Professorson?

105
00:04:47,594 --> 00:04:49,575
My family name is Professorberg,

106
00:04:49,576 --> 00:04:52,108
but we changed it when we
were fleeing from the Nazis.

107
00:04:52,109 --> 00:04:53,068
Oh, I'm so sorry.

108
00:04:53,069 --> 00:04:54,429
You've probably never heard of me

109
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,206
since I primarily teach night school.

110
00:04:56,207 --> 00:04:58,098
My faculty ID.

111
00:04:59,487 --> 00:05:00,764
Oh, well, I...

112
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,676
guess I never stuck around late enough

113
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,982
to meet you night school professors.

114
00:05:04,983 --> 00:05:07,071
TV's gotten crazy good, you know.

115
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:09,396
I have to take this.

116
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,111
Thank you for indulging me, dean.

117
00:05:11,241 --> 00:05:13,546
Jeff, read chapters 10
through 12 of Douglas

118
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:14,933
and see you next week.

119
00:05:16,722 --> 00:05:17,839
That is...

120
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,300
if I still exist.

121
00:05:21,734 --> 00:05:22,927
See you, professor.

122
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,014
Sorry to doubt you, Jeffrey.

123
00:05:26,207 --> 00:05:28,698
More importantly, out with this audit,

124
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:31,584
back to chapter one of time desk...

125
00:05:31,585 --> 00:05:34,456
The Chronicles of Dean Dangerous.

126
00:05:34,753 --> 00:05:36,370
That is gonna be the
worst book I'll ever read

127
00:05:36,371 --> 00:05:39,347
- cover to cover.
- I'm a terrible friend.

128
00:05:39,356 --> 00:05:42,048
I accused you of being a lying cheat.

129
00:05:42,386 --> 00:05:44,730
- Can you ever forgive me?
- Sure.

130
00:05:44,731 --> 00:05:46,073
Here's the thing, though.

131
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,870
I've never seen that guy in my life!

132
00:05:48,871 --> 00:05:51,858
What? That wasn't
Professor Professorson?

133
00:05:51,859 --> 00:05:53,366
There is no Professor Professorson!

134
00:05:53,367 --> 00:05:55,569
I made him up! I forged a form

135
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:58,243
with a phony teacher and
class for a free credit!

136
00:05:58,244 --> 00:05:59,115
I knew it!

137
00:05:59,116 --> 00:06:00,892
Oh, you lying cheat!

138
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,082
Wait. Then...

139
00:06:04,527 --> 00:06:05,463
who was that?

140
00:06:05,464 --> 00:06:06,657
I don't know!

141
00:06:09,058 --> 00:06:10,946
- Wait, what?
- I don't know!

142
00:06:14,814 --> 00:06:15,722
What should we do?

143
00:06:15,723 --> 00:06:16,993
I think we should grab some lunch.

144
00:06:16,994 --> 00:06:18,313
- I'm serious.
- So am I.

145
00:06:18,314 --> 00:06:19,968
I just saw fat Neil
head to the cafeteria

146
00:06:19,969 --> 00:06:21,156
with that look in his eye.

147
00:06:21,157 --> 00:06:23,097
We got ten minutes to
grab the last lima bean.

148
00:06:23,098 --> 00:06:24,361
Jeff, you made up a professor,

149
00:06:24,362 --> 00:06:25,722
and he just appeared out of thin air.

150
00:06:25,723 --> 00:06:27,475
You're not the least bit
curious how that happened?

151
00:06:27,476 --> 00:06:29,154
My latest theory?
Maybe I'm a God.

152
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:30,528
I've denied the signs for too long.

153
00:06:30,529 --> 00:06:31,515
This is so typical.

154
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:32,887
You're just gonna
blow off what happened.

155
00:06:32,888 --> 00:06:34,315
Yes, especially when not blowing it off

156
00:06:34,316 --> 00:06:36,198
might cost me my free credit.

157
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:37,326
Now, do me a favor.

158
00:06:37,327 --> 00:06:39,487
Be very un-Annie and blow it off too.

159
00:06:39,488 --> 00:06:41,300
Oh, sure. I'll just blow it off.

160
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:43,135
I'll just blow everything off.

161
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:45,197
Heck, I guess I'll just
blow off walkin'!

162
00:06:45,429 --> 00:06:47,599
- Okay.
- I'll just blow off standing.

163
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,342
I'm just blowin' everything off!

164
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:52,653
Maybe I'll blow off talking language.

165
00:06:52,654 --> 00:06:53,229
Okay.

166
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:56,607
Blee blu blah blah blah
blee blu blu blah...

167
00:07:01,445 --> 00:07:03,157
Hey, bros, what's the ha...

168
00:07:04,441 --> 00:07:05,580
Ohh!

169
00:07:06,056 --> 00:07:08,029
Sweet fort!

170
00:07:08,074 --> 00:07:09,544
Can I come inside?

171
00:07:17,035 --> 00:07:18,202
You could, Pavel...

172
00:07:18,556 --> 00:07:21,242
or... maybe the inside
could come to you.

173
00:07:21,334 --> 00:07:22,267
How would you characterize

174
00:07:22,268 --> 00:07:24,034
the amount of blankets
and pillows you have?

175
00:07:24,627 --> 00:07:25,887
A butt load?

176
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:28,444
I get wicked cold, bros,

177
00:07:28,445 --> 00:07:30,231
and mad sleepy.

178
00:07:39,044 --> 00:07:40,839
If you're here to
help me take my diorama

179
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,814
to the bio-diorama-rama,
I can do it myself.

180
00:07:43,817 --> 00:07:45,115
Yes. You made that clear

181
00:07:45,116 --> 00:07:47,711
in your 11th "I can do it myself" text.

182
00:07:47,712 --> 00:07:49,586
You even work too hard
at passive-aggression,

183
00:07:49,587 --> 00:07:50,603
you know that?

184
00:07:52,344 --> 00:07:54,376
Hey, so...

185
00:07:55,119 --> 00:07:57,127
do you know anything about
greendale's night school?

186
00:07:57,128 --> 00:07:58,721
Yeah. I'm assuming it's the worst thing

187
00:07:58,722 --> 00:08:00,325
you could ever hope to be in...

188
00:08:00,676 --> 00:08:01,950
Only at night.

189
00:08:03,096 --> 00:08:05,534
Damn it, Annie.
Have you been playing detective?

190
00:08:05,553 --> 00:08:07,574
You are gonna Nancy
screw me out of my credit.

191
00:08:07,575 --> 00:08:10,192
Relax. All I did was ask
the administration desk

192
00:08:10,193 --> 00:08:12,237
if I could borrow a faculty directory.

193
00:08:14,391 --> 00:08:15,735
Take a look at this.

194
00:08:17,095 --> 00:08:18,315
Is that Professorson?

195
00:08:18,316 --> 00:08:20,317
His real name is Professor Woolley,

196
00:08:20,318 --> 00:08:22,616
and he actually does
teach night school here.

197
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,632
Why would someone you've never met

198
00:08:24,633 --> 00:08:26,193
pretend to be your phony Professor?

199
00:08:26,194 --> 00:08:29,116
He was already carrying
falsified faculty credentials.

200
00:08:29,117 --> 00:08:30,338
Do you know what this means?

201
00:08:30,339 --> 00:08:33,707
Yes. You are making me do work
for my fake conspiracy class!

202
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:36,630
Exactly.
There's a conspiracy here.

203
00:08:36,893 --> 00:08:38,970
A dark, vast conspiracy

204
00:08:38,971 --> 00:08:40,666
that may just go all the way to the top.

205
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:41,980
This is greendale, Annie.

206
00:08:41,981 --> 00:08:43,223
If there's a conspiracy,

207
00:08:43,224 --> 00:08:45,558
it goes all the way to
slightly below the middle.

208
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:46,611
Wait a minute.

209
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,370
Something's wrong.

210
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:50,493
My car won't start.

211
00:08:50,494 --> 00:08:51,635
Hold on one second.

212
00:08:52,711 --> 00:08:53,453
Hello.

213
00:08:53,454 --> 00:08:54,364
Tell your little friend

214
00:08:54,365 --> 00:08:56,409
to stop snooping around night school,

215
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:59,646
otherwise, things
might get... explosive.

216
00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:06,074
Annie!

217
00:09:19,187 --> 00:09:20,125
You okay?

218
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,121
Yeah.

219
00:09:22,211 --> 00:09:23,790
Probably didn't need to tackle you.

220
00:09:23,848 --> 00:09:25,057
Probably not.

221
00:09:26,377 --> 00:09:28,840
Looks like someone sent us a message...

222
00:09:29,205 --> 00:09:32,762
A tiny, thoroughly
underwhelming message.

223
00:09:34,066 --> 00:09:35,635
I hope you've already
laid out your outfit

224
00:09:35,636 --> 00:09:36,963
for tomorrow morning...

225
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:39,023
because we're going to night school.

226
00:09:43,155 --> 00:09:45,358
I stole these from my son's house.

227
00:09:47,527 --> 00:09:49,342
When does a fort stop being a fort?

228
00:09:49,343 --> 00:09:51,821
Hey. As long as it's still
made out of blankets...

229
00:09:51,926 --> 00:09:52,985
Right?

230
00:09:54,873 --> 00:09:55,585
These'll be perfect

231
00:09:55,586 --> 00:09:57,156
for the Pierce's mom memorial tunnel.

232
00:10:03,449 --> 00:10:04,583
How ' bout this one?

233
00:10:06,287 --> 00:10:08,237
No. That's Professor Huyck's class...

234
00:10:08,238 --> 00:10:10,811
"History of... Something."

235
00:10:10,812 --> 00:10:11,876
You can't pronounce it?

236
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:13,973
No. It literally says
history of something.

237
00:10:14,055 --> 00:10:15,179
Let me see that.

238
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:19,393
"Principles of Intermediate?

239
00:10:19,394 --> 00:10:22,369
"Studyology"? "Class 101"?

240
00:10:22,687 --> 00:10:24,264
Look, this one just says learning

241
00:10:24,265 --> 00:10:25,821
with an exclamation point.

242
00:10:29,982 --> 00:10:32,417
Hello, Professor Professorson.

243
00:10:32,864 --> 00:10:35,334
Or should I say... Woolley?

244
00:10:36,057 --> 00:10:38,110
What class are you
teaching tonight, professor?

245
00:10:38,224 --> 00:10:39,198
Math.

246
00:10:39,244 --> 00:10:40,776
- Math?
- Uh-huh.

247
00:10:41,034 --> 00:10:42,418
Do you mind if we sit in?

248
00:10:42,764 --> 00:10:44,649
Not at all. Right this way.

249
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:50,540
So what kind of math
do you teach, professor?

250
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:52,006
Well, you know, math.

251
00:10:52,007 --> 00:10:54,056
Uh... Numbers.

252
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,974
Pi.

253
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,957
New math. Uh...

254
00:11:02,518 --> 00:11:03,560
Get him!

255
00:11:11,014 --> 00:11:12,714
He went into that blanket fort!

256
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,029
I think he went this way!

257
00:11:15,725 --> 00:11:16,786
- Do you see him?
- Oh, sorry.

258
00:11:16,787 --> 00:11:18,115
- No!
- Sorry.

259
00:11:19,158 --> 00:11:21,019
- Troy! Abed!
- Hey, guys.

260
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,133
Welcome to Fluffy town.

261
00:11:22,134 --> 00:11:23,682
No smoking, no farting,
no pillow fighting.

262
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,897
- We're in a chase!
- That's allowed.

263
00:11:26,194 --> 00:11:27,334
There he is!

264
00:11:29,179 --> 00:11:31,042
- Follow us.
- But afterwards,

265
00:11:31,043 --> 00:11:33,337
you should really check out
our civil rights museum.

266
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,348
Leonard, back up!

267
00:11:43,349 --> 00:11:44,472
You shouldn't even be in here, Leonard.

268
00:11:44,473 --> 00:11:45,933
You already have three
farting strikes against you.

269
00:11:45,934 --> 00:11:47,195
W... He's getting away!

270
00:11:47,196 --> 00:11:49,728
I know a shortcut.
Through the turkish district.

271
00:11:57,012 --> 00:11:58,020
Britta?

272
00:11:58,475 --> 00:11:59,684
Hey.

273
00:12:00,175 --> 00:12:01,127
Go!

274
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:08,458
There he is!
What the hell's this?

275
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:10,204
Latvian independence parade.

276
00:12:11,128 --> 00:12:13,543
Don't look at me.
They had the proper permits.

277
00:12:13,544 --> 00:12:15,577
Dang it! We lost him!

278
00:12:15,578 --> 00:12:18,147
Luckily, I sent the
diorama car to the chem lab

279
00:12:18,148 --> 00:12:19,432
to have the explosive analyzed.

280
00:12:19,433 --> 00:12:21,752
Isn't that him playing the trejdeksnis?

281
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:24,955
Nice try, Woolley!

282
00:12:24,956 --> 00:12:26,679
Now, tell us everything.

283
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,111
Tell you?

284
00:12:28,877 --> 00:12:30,041
Ha ha ha.

285
00:12:31,038 --> 00:12:32,775
I'll show you!

286
00:12:38,776 --> 00:12:40,349
What is this place?

287
00:12:42,296 --> 00:12:44,424
This, Annie, is night school.

288
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:47,974
Every student, every teacher,
every class...

289
00:12:48,505 --> 00:12:49,668
Figments...

290
00:12:50,487 --> 00:12:51,775
Puffs of hot air...

291
00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:53,367
from the lips of a ghost

292
00:12:53,368 --> 00:12:55,696
in the shadow of a unicorn's dream.

293
00:12:56,471 --> 00:12:58,791
I made it up.
Night school doesn't exist.

294
00:12:58,792 --> 00:13:01,239
I used to be a student here
at Greendale like you, Jeff,

295
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,096
then one day I invented a
fake course to get a free credit.

296
00:13:05,097 --> 00:13:07,238
To keep up the lie,
I had to create a fake teacher

297
00:13:07,239 --> 00:13:09,164
who needed other fake classes

298
00:13:09,165 --> 00:13:11,338
that needed to be filled
with other fake students,

299
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:14,539
and so on and so on
and so on, "etchethra"!

300
00:13:14,638 --> 00:13:16,574
Did you just mispronounce et cetera?

301
00:13:16,575 --> 00:13:18,356
My Latin class is fake, Jeff...

302
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,233
Like all my classes, like my life.

303
00:13:20,234 --> 00:13:21,006
Aren't you listening?

304
00:13:21,007 --> 00:13:22,126
Yeah, I am.

305
00:13:22,393 --> 00:13:25,380
And a very familiar feeling
is starting to come over me.

306
00:13:25,703 --> 00:13:27,956
I feel like someone is
trying to teach me something.

307
00:13:27,957 --> 00:13:28,758
Jeff, the only thing

308
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:30,960
that's ever been learned
in this room is regret!

309
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:35,320
Would that this desk
were a time desk...

310
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:39,135
so that I could correct
my past mistakes...

311
00:13:39,168 --> 00:13:40,724
Ride dinosaurs...

312
00:13:41,629 --> 00:13:42,861
Fight with Jack the Ripper.

313
00:13:42,862 --> 00:13:44,649
Oh, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

314
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:48,135
Unicorns? Ghost lips?
Time desks?

315
00:13:48,323 --> 00:13:50,848
Doesn't any of this
overly stylized garbage

316
00:13:50,849 --> 00:13:52,256
remind you of anyone?

317
00:13:52,648 --> 00:13:54,198
Everything this guy says is ripped from

318
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:56,327
the Sure-To-Be-Unpublished Pages

319
00:13:56,328 --> 00:13:58,455
of Dean Dangerous.

320
00:13:58,962 --> 00:14:00,247
I don't know what you mean.

321
00:14:00,248 --> 00:14:01,512
Oh, I think you do.

322
00:14:01,518 --> 00:14:04,305
By the way, next time you
walk someone to your fake lair,

323
00:14:04,306 --> 00:14:06,638
don't pass the theater department...

324
00:14:07,057 --> 00:14:09,625
Drama Professor Sean Garrity.

325
00:14:11,762 --> 00:14:12,792
Whoa!

326
00:14:17,831 --> 00:14:19,662
Thank God.
That character was killing me.

327
00:14:19,663 --> 00:14:22,778
Word of advice... If you ever
scrape the dean's car,

328
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,966
don't tell him you're gonna
pay him back in acting.

329
00:14:24,967 --> 00:14:28,355
On Thanksgiving, I'm supposed
to crash his family dinner

330
00:14:28,356 --> 00:14:30,431
and accuse him of
stealing my girlfriend.

331
00:14:30,432 --> 00:14:33,745
Wow. I guess this did go
all the way to the top.

332
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,751
I'm calling the dean right now

333
00:14:35,752 --> 00:14:37,487
and giving him a piece of my mind!

334
00:14:38,157 --> 00:14:39,277
No, wait.

335
00:14:39,682 --> 00:14:40,821
Garrity...

336
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,525
Does the theater department
have any of those prop guns

337
00:14:43,526 --> 00:14:45,087
that fire blanks?

338
00:14:45,255 --> 00:14:47,669
Of course. We just did a
modern retelling of MacBeth

339
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,298
set in gangland Chicago.

340
00:14:49,299 --> 00:14:50,704
Oh. Fresh take.

341
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:52,501
And you think I'm lazy.

342
00:14:52,784 --> 00:14:54,114
Prop guns?

343
00:14:54,115 --> 00:14:56,208
Jeff... What do you have in mind?

344
00:14:56,209 --> 00:14:57,965
A little demonstration for the dean

345
00:14:57,966 --> 00:15:00,117
on the dangers of trying to educate me.

346
00:15:00,187 --> 00:15:01,965
He doesn't like fake classes?

347
00:15:01,966 --> 00:15:04,725
Well, he's about to get
a real lesson on the fact

348
00:15:04,726 --> 00:15:07,499
that Jeff Winger never learns.

349
00:15:11,905 --> 00:15:13,819
Here he comes. Get set.

350
00:15:17,231 --> 00:15:18,494
You wanted to see me?

351
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:19,827
Oh.

352
00:15:20,228 --> 00:15:22,148
Hi, Mr... Professorson.

353
00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:24,221
His real name is Woolley.

354
00:15:24,288 --> 00:15:25,768
And he's defrauded your school

355
00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:28,217
to a tune of dozens of credits per year

356
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:30,510
and nearly twice as many dollars.

357
00:15:30,652 --> 00:15:32,053
Well, that's serious.

358
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:33,710
Fortunately for you,

359
00:15:33,711 --> 00:15:35,605
I'm a big believer in second chances.

360
00:15:35,687 --> 00:15:36,990
I'm not.

361
00:15:38,616 --> 00:15:39,671
Hey!

362
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:40,776
Annie!

363
00:15:40,777 --> 00:15:42,988
Oh, my God, you... you shot him!

364
00:15:42,989 --> 00:15:45,792
Course I shot him!
He was being dishonest.

365
00:15:45,793 --> 00:15:48,501
And if there's one thing
greendale's taught me, it's...

366
00:15:49,052 --> 00:15:51,200
- Whoa, what the hell?
- She had a gun!

367
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:53,174
It was a fake gun! We staged this

368
00:15:53,175 --> 00:15:54,719
to get back at you for deceiving us!

369
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,311
But you're the deceiver, Jeffrey!

370
00:15:56,312 --> 00:15:58,485
Yeah? Well, now you're the dead guy.

371
00:16:01,655 --> 00:16:03,634
Jeff! What are you doing?

372
00:16:03,635 --> 00:16:05,523
Why do you have a real gun?

373
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:07,900
Why did you shoot the dean?

374
00:16:07,901 --> 00:16:10,157
- Well, he shot you!
- Not really!

375
00:16:10,158 --> 00:16:12,455
He and I were in on this from the start.

376
00:16:12,456 --> 00:16:14,192
When he found out you
were faking a class,

377
00:16:14,193 --> 00:16:17,212
he came to me and we cooked
up this whole conspiracy thing

378
00:16:17,213 --> 00:16:19,782
to illustrate the slippery slope

379
00:16:19,783 --> 00:16:21,511
of academic fraud!

380
00:16:21,512 --> 00:16:23,802
You know what you
actually illustrated, Annie?

381
00:16:25,934 --> 00:16:27,553
How to be a crappy friend.

382
00:16:28,531 --> 00:16:29,972
Once it was obvious

383
00:16:29,973 --> 00:16:31,840
the dean had orchestrated everything,

384
00:16:31,841 --> 00:16:33,075
it was even more obvious

385
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:35,807
the dean was too stupid
to orchestrate anything.

386
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:38,215
- Mm-hmm!
- So on a hunch, I called him,

387
00:16:38,216 --> 00:16:41,284
and we hatched a plan to
teach you a lesson or two

388
00:16:41,285 --> 00:16:42,426
about friendship.

389
00:16:42,427 --> 00:16:44,912
But, Jeff, I only did it
because I love you.

390
00:16:46,868 --> 00:16:48,267
Well, when you love someone,

391
00:16:48,535 --> 00:16:50,365
you have to take them as they are.

392
00:16:50,694 --> 00:16:52,475
People aren't playthings, Annie.

393
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:53,703
No, they are not.

394
00:16:53,704 --> 00:16:55,045
Look who's talking.

395
00:16:55,564 --> 00:16:57,728
After everything you've put me through?

396
00:16:58,037 --> 00:17:00,606
Okay. Where'd you get that gun?

397
00:17:02,551 --> 00:17:04,697
There were only three prop guns.

398
00:17:04,698 --> 00:17:06,634
Yeah, well, I live in
a terrible neighborhood.

399
00:17:06,635 --> 00:17:08,946
Annie, put the gun down.

400
00:17:08,947 --> 00:17:10,245
After we kissed,

401
00:17:10,538 --> 00:17:12,727
I waited all summer to see you.

402
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,211
You... buried me

403
00:17:15,212 --> 00:17:16,982
like a shameful secret.

404
00:17:16,983 --> 00:17:17,771
Whoa.

405
00:17:17,772 --> 00:17:19,249
What's the matter, Jeff?

406
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,302
Afraid crazy Annie
would go crazy for you?

407
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:24,287
Well, guess what.

408
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,373
Annie's got a gun.

409
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:27,634
Annie, just put the gun...

410
00:17:34,663 --> 00:17:37,665
Annie... What have you done?

411
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,635
If you love Jeff winger so much,

412
00:17:39,636 --> 00:17:41,908
why did you conspire
with me against him?

413
00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:43,267
I don't know!

414
00:17:43,569 --> 00:17:46,659
I can't keep track of any of it anymore!

415
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:50,047
I just keep teaming up
with whoever suggests it!

416
00:17:50,048 --> 00:17:52,030
Glad to hear you admit it.

417
00:17:52,945 --> 00:17:55,248
When I called you to ask you
to double-cross Annie,

418
00:17:55,249 --> 00:17:57,002
you didn't hesitate for a second.

419
00:17:57,003 --> 00:17:58,908
Do you even understand
what a conspiracy is?

420
00:17:59,007 --> 00:18:01,297
If you conspire with every
person that approaches you,

421
00:18:01,298 --> 00:18:03,219
you're not even really
conspiring with anyone.

422
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,307
You're just doing random crap.

423
00:18:05,308 --> 00:18:06,461
I know, I...

424
00:18:06,462 --> 00:18:08,344
I'm sorry! I just...

425
00:18:08,847 --> 00:18:11,632
I just wanna have fun
with you guys and...

426
00:18:11,908 --> 00:18:15,443
I go crazy cooped up in
my little office, and...

427
00:18:16,764 --> 00:18:20,371
Time travel is really
hard to write about!

428
00:18:20,419 --> 00:18:22,724
Ohhhh...kay!

429
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,771
If I'm keeping track right,
we should be done.

430
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:29,532
I'll just take these back
to the theater department.

431
00:18:30,704 --> 00:18:31,941
- Police!
- Aah!

432
00:18:31,942 --> 00:18:32,854
Drop your weapons!

433
00:18:32,855 --> 00:18:34,408
- Down on the ground!
- Don't shoot, officer!

434
00:18:34,409 --> 00:18:36,098
Don't shoot, please.
They're fake...

435
00:18:40,106 --> 00:18:42,300
Those are prop guns!

436
00:18:42,885 --> 00:18:43,859
Well...

437
00:18:44,213 --> 00:18:45,688
I guess it just goes to show you...

438
00:18:46,405 --> 00:18:49,060
prop guns belong backstage.

439
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:51,287
And... Scene.

440
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:54,345
You have got to be kidding me!

441
00:18:55,188 --> 00:18:56,399
Professor garrity called and told me

442
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,707
what all of you were up to.

443
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:01,016
Made me mad. Guns aren't toys.

444
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:05,560
In 100% of all fake gun
related shootings,

445
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,330
the victim is always the
one with the fake gun.

446
00:19:09,346 --> 00:19:10,962
Hey, Sean, you got breakfast plans?

447
00:19:11,007 --> 00:19:12,155
I do now.

448
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:13,743
So, Sean...

449
00:19:14,873 --> 00:19:17,447
We're still on for Thanksgiving, right?

450
00:19:18,049 --> 00:19:19,942
Just talk to your father, Craig.

451
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:24,545
Would that this hoodie
were a time hoodie.

452
00:19:25,868 --> 00:19:26,858
Hey, dean,

453
00:19:27,201 --> 00:19:28,353
how 'bout that credit?

454
00:19:28,354 --> 00:19:29,504
Aaa

455
00:19:30,574 --> 00:19:31,551
damn it.

456
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:33,410
I'm not sure what lessons

457
00:19:33,411 --> 00:19:34,652
either of us managed
to teach each other,

458
00:19:34,653 --> 00:19:36,466
but I am proud of Annie.

459
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:39,401
She took to deception like
Abed took to Cougar Town.

460
00:19:39,402 --> 00:19:40,339
It's really good.

461
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,240
Especially when she went off script.

462
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,353
You said to be convincing.

463
00:19:45,426 --> 00:19:47,016
Check it out, bros.

464
00:19:47,017 --> 00:19:49,312
You made the front page!

465
00:19:53,337 --> 00:19:54,507
You know what this means.

466
00:19:54,949 --> 00:19:56,277
We've gone mainstream.

467
00:19:56,658 --> 00:19:58,096
Initiate Protocol Omega.

468
00:20:24,077 --> 00:20:25,616
We've started looting!

469
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:32,096
Wanna build a cardboard submarine?

470
00:20:33,534 --> 00:20:34,843
Get out of my brain.

471
00:20:37,898 --> 00:20:39,454
- Once...
- Upon...

472
00:20:39,455 --> 00:20:40,872
- A...
- Time...

473
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:41,990
- There...
- Was...

474
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:43,004
A...

475
00:20:43,924 --> 00:20:45,913
- Big...
- Spaceship.

476
00:20:46,068 --> 00:20:47,588
- And...
- Aliens.

477
00:20:47,824 --> 00:20:49,358
- And...
- Mercenaries.

478
00:20:49,712 --> 00:20:51,144
- And?
- War.

479
00:20:51,923 --> 00:20:54,084
- And?
- Betrayal.

480
00:20:54,819 --> 00:20:55,908
And?

481
00:20:56,424 --> 00:20:57,526
Romance?

482
00:20:57,845 --> 00:20:58,978
- And...
- Karate.

483
00:20:59,201 --> 00:21:00,507
- And?
- Credits.

484
00:21:00,725 --> 00:21:02,027
- The...
- End.

485
00:21:02,768 --> 00:21:04,372
We should write a screenplay together.

486
00:21:04,451 --> 00:21:06,076
Cool. Cool, cool, cool.

486
00:21:07,305 --> 00:21:13,797
