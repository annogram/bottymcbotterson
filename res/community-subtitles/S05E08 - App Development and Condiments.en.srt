1
00:00:01,275 --> 00:00:04,656
Okay, we'll get an estimate
on adding grass to the soccer field.

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:06,493
Good meeting.

3
00:00:06,655 --> 00:00:08,826
Oh, Jeff, what time's dinner?

4
00:00:09,742 --> 00:00:12,672
- Dinner?
- Jeff, you didn't invite Shirley?

5
00:00:12,828 --> 00:00:16,921
Well, it's Tuesday. Shirley always goes
to Elijah's karate practise on Tuesdays.

6
00:00:17,082 --> 00:00:20,179
It's okay. Part of making sacrifices
for my loved ones...

7
00:00:20,336 --> 00:00:23,682
...is not expecting my loved ones
to make sacrifices.

8
00:00:25,549 --> 00:00:27,934
- I can do tomorrow.
- I can't.

9
00:00:28,093 --> 00:00:30,774
- I'm free on Fridays and Mondays...
- We're not moving it.

10
00:00:32,223 --> 00:00:34,856
When Shirley can have dinner,
we'll have another dinner...

11
00:00:35,017 --> 00:00:36,987
...because it's just dinner.

12
00:00:37,144 --> 00:00:40,775
And there's no need to manipulate each
other. You know that's what you do.

13
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,950
You know you're doing it now
with that face.

14
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:46,534
You don't like my face?

15
00:00:50,157 --> 00:00:52,209
Hello, Save Greendale Committee.

16
00:00:52,368 --> 00:00:56,710
This is David and Bixel.
They're app designers.

17
00:00:56,872 --> 00:01:00,882
They'd like to beta test their latest
social-networking app on our campus...

18
00:01:01,043 --> 00:01:04,140
...which could be good for us.
Look what Facebook did for Harvard.

19
00:01:04,296 --> 00:01:07,262
Hey, guys, Bixel and I
would like to introduce you...

20
00:01:07,424 --> 00:01:09,975
...to a little app
called MeowMeowBeenz.

21
00:01:10,678 --> 00:01:13,359
MeowMeowBeenz lets you say
how much you like...

22
00:01:13,514 --> 00:01:15,685
...who you like, when you like...

23
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:18,483
...all from a standard
non-boost mobile phone.

24
00:01:18,644 --> 00:01:20,234
Let's see how it works.

25
00:01:20,396 --> 00:01:23,694
Bixel, what did you think
of the way the dean introduced us?

26
00:01:23,858 --> 00:01:25,068
I thought he did great.

27
00:01:25,234 --> 00:01:29,114
That's why I'm giving him
five MeowMeowBeenz.

28
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,369
Well, Bixel, I'm sorry,
but I thought his intro was just okay.

29
00:01:34,535 --> 00:01:39,922
That's why I'm gonna give him
two out of five MeowMeowBeenz.

30
00:01:40,499 --> 00:01:41,757
My MeowMeowBeenz.

31
00:01:41,917 --> 00:01:44,765
With MeowMeowBeenz,
students can rate teachers.

32
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,261
Teachers can rate students.

33
00:01:46,422 --> 00:01:49,269
Everyone and anyone
can rate each other.

34
00:01:49,425 --> 00:01:50,931
- MeowMeowBeenz.
- MeowMeowBeenz.

35
00:01:51,927 --> 00:01:54,941
You know, I could...

36
00:01:56,974 --> 00:01:59,478
I fought for this country...

37
00:01:59,727 --> 00:02:04,567
...and I know you don't get to pick
and choose the parts you fight for...

38
00:02:04,732 --> 00:02:06,285
...but I know...

39
00:02:06,442 --> 00:02:08,743
I should go number two soon.

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

41
00:02:41,727 --> 00:02:43,649
Hurry up.
I'm late for Human Rights class.

42
00:02:43,812 --> 00:02:45,319
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:45,898 --> 00:02:47,903
Why is Starburns
carrying Garrett's books?

44
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:49,988
It's like toast bossing crackers around.

45
00:02:50,152 --> 00:02:52,620
- I mean, I guess.
- Garrett's got three MeowMeowBeenz.

46
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,579
- Starburns is at two.
- People are using this stupid app?

47
00:02:55,741 --> 00:02:57,829
- It's effective.
- No, it's effectively stupid.

48
00:02:57,993 --> 00:03:01,256
There was a rating system in place
called "cool people get more"...

49
00:03:01,413 --> 00:03:02,671
...and it was working fine.

50
00:03:02,832 --> 00:03:05,715
MeowMeowBeenz takes everything
about human interaction...

51
00:03:05,876 --> 00:03:08,344
...and reduces it
to explicit, objective numbers.

52
00:03:08,504 --> 00:03:09,761
I've never felt more alive.

53
00:03:09,922 --> 00:03:12,307
As long as you're happy, I'm unsettled.

54
00:03:13,175 --> 00:03:14,729
Hey, guys.

55
00:03:15,636 --> 00:03:18,436
- What happened to you?
- I sat so long, my feet fell asleep.

56
00:03:18,597 --> 00:03:21,065
Then I noticed limping
was getting MeowMeowBeenz...

57
00:03:21,225 --> 00:03:23,859
...so I just kind of started committing.

58
00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:26,440
Did you understand a word he said?

59
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:39,083
Hey, here you go. Here you go.

60
00:03:39,243 --> 00:03:42,541
Nobody is gonna down-vote a guy
on his birthday.

61
00:03:42,705 --> 00:03:45,837
- Wait. Are you using MeowMeowBeenz?
- If you can't kill it, join it.

62
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,839
You get older, you see warning signs.

63
00:03:48,002 --> 00:03:51,430
Mark Zuckerberg
is Fidel Castro in flip-flops.

64
00:03:51,589 --> 00:03:55,350
MeowMeowBeenz is gonna make
East Berlin look like Woodstock.

65
00:03:55,509 --> 00:03:56,720
You take my word for that.

66
00:03:57,261 --> 00:04:00,476
Do you own stock
in Trivial Pursuit's Baby Boom Edition?

67
00:04:02,975 --> 00:04:05,692
Britta, please tell me
you're not using this app.

68
00:04:05,853 --> 00:04:09,365
I liked the idea at first,
giving a voice to the unheard...

69
00:04:09,523 --> 00:04:11,860
...but then Annie told me
that the rating system...

70
00:04:12,026 --> 00:04:13,497
...is exponentially weighted.

71
00:04:13,652 --> 00:04:17,164
As your ratings go up, your ratings of
other people become more important.

72
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:19,292
- No.
- It means the more others like you...

73
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,751
...the more likeable you make others.
Makes sense.

74
00:04:21,911 --> 00:04:25,541
- You know who else it made sense to?
- Say "Hitler" and I'm giving you a two.

75
00:04:25,706 --> 00:04:29,503
You not registered? The longer you
wait, the harder to get your number up.

76
00:04:29,668 --> 00:04:33,263
Annie. Listen to yourself.
You're learning its language.

77
00:04:33,422 --> 00:04:36,768
You're letting a video game play you.
I gotta set these people straight.

78
00:04:36,926 --> 00:04:38,183
Hey, hey, you've got a...

79
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:42,688
Students of Greendale!

80
00:04:42,848 --> 00:04:45,980
We don't have to worship a calculator!

81
00:04:46,143 --> 00:04:50,023
There is no formula for people!

82
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:56,199
You're punishing me for being alive!

83
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:58,082
That's the general idea, baby.

84
00:05:00,616 --> 00:05:03,879
You're gonna think I'm joking,
but you were getting through more...

85
00:05:04,036 --> 00:05:05,792
- ...with mustard on your lip.
- Shut up.

86
00:05:05,955 --> 00:05:08,126
He's not kidding.
I thought I was imagining it.

87
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:11,138
When you had mustard on your lip,
I was open to your opinion.

88
00:05:11,293 --> 00:05:15,137
Maybe it dilutes or distracts
from your excessive intensity.

89
00:05:15,297 --> 00:05:18,477
Maybe it dilutes or distracts
from your stupid butt.

90
00:05:18,634 --> 00:05:20,390
- How you doing, Rog?
- Oh, don't be...

91
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:22,973
Hey, Charlotte.
I see what you did there.

92
00:05:23,138 --> 00:05:25,108
Vicki, I love this.

93
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,104
- Shirley's a five.
- How?

94
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,654
She's nice to people, Jeff.
You know Shirley.

95
00:05:31,814 --> 00:05:33,321
Oh, Vicki, thank you.

96
00:05:33,482 --> 00:05:36,828
Did you just give me
four MeowMeowBeenz?

97
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:40,286
I love my four from Vicki.

98
00:05:41,866 --> 00:05:43,337
No.

99
00:05:43,492 --> 00:05:45,213
Stop it!

100
00:05:45,369 --> 00:05:47,421
I didn't mean it.

101
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:51,131
Yeah. I do know Shirley.

102
00:05:55,212 --> 00:05:56,802
We should be having brownies.

103
00:05:57,381 --> 00:05:58,674
I'm going to help Shirley.

104
00:05:58,841 --> 00:06:01,142
Not a bad idea.
She could make you a two again.

105
00:06:01,302 --> 00:06:03,307
Screw your twos,
and screw MeowMeowBeenz.

106
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,108
I know that's your one talking.

107
00:06:07,683 --> 00:06:10,103
- What are you doing?
- Registering for MeowMeowBeenz.

108
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:12,986
I'm gonna become a five
and expose this for the sham it is.

109
00:06:13,147 --> 00:06:15,401
Oh, now you're
speaking my language.

110
00:06:15,566 --> 00:06:17,820
That's unintentional, trust me.

111
00:06:18,402 --> 00:06:20,953
Make sure you know the reason
you're doing something...

112
00:06:21,113 --> 00:06:22,869
...or you'll fail before you start.

113
00:06:23,032 --> 00:06:26,793
- That's actually a good point.
- It is? Why?

114
00:06:28,579 --> 00:06:30,382
Oh, come on.

115
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:37,095
I'm like, "That's two cups,"
and she's like, "What?"

116
00:06:37,254 --> 00:06:41,051
I'm like,
"Two cups, balls back, tops off."

117
00:06:41,217 --> 00:06:44,811
All right, Trent, Mulch, Dave...

118
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:50,439
...Herpie, Clutch, Dirt Mouth, Rope,
Tingles, Cat Woman, Steve.

119
00:06:50,601 --> 00:06:51,894
All right, keep it floppy.

120
00:06:52,061 --> 00:06:53,900
Haul it, ball it, never call it.

121
00:06:54,063 --> 00:06:55,404
- Girls are objects.
- Yeah!

122
00:07:02,988 --> 00:07:04,412
Two MeowMeowBeenz.

123
00:07:04,573 --> 00:07:05,700
Congratulations.

124
00:07:05,866 --> 00:07:08,584
Abed was just explaining
that the fives get to choose...

125
00:07:08,744 --> 00:07:10,298
...what setting
the air conditioning is on.

126
00:07:10,454 --> 00:07:11,795
Yep.

127
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:14,835
Is it me,
or are more people wearing grey?

128
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,586
I feel like someone's about
to hand me a Starburst.

129
00:07:17,753 --> 00:07:20,304
Wear neutral colours.
Looking like you wanna move up...

130
00:07:20,464 --> 00:07:22,386
- ...can get you moved down.
- Abed, hey.

131
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,720
- Hey, come here.
- Hi. Come on.

132
00:07:24,885 --> 00:07:28,516
Those are other threes. We talk
about how we're glad we're not twos.

133
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:31,152
Small talk, guys.

134
00:07:31,308 --> 00:07:32,435
I make small talk now.

135
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:36,450
Hello, Jeffrey. I see you decided
to join MeowMeowBeenz.

136
00:07:36,605 --> 00:07:38,159
Oh, it's a great tool for living.

137
00:07:38,315 --> 00:07:40,202
- You look great.
- You look great.

138
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:42,613
- Know what you're doing.
- Know what you're doing.

139
00:07:42,778 --> 00:07:44,285
I'm watching you, okay?

140
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:49,870
Yeah, you'll be watching my hinder,
Mama...

141
00:07:50,035 --> 00:07:53,915
...and choking on its billowing plume
of highly rated dust.

142
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,778
Fours and above only.

143
00:08:12,933 --> 00:08:14,570
These are snacks for the fives.

144
00:08:15,144 --> 00:08:17,196
Yeah? You're a two.

145
00:08:17,354 --> 00:08:21,412
Leonard, would you rather a three
serve the fives food?

146
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:22,778
No.

147
00:08:24,778 --> 00:08:27,626
It is no secret
that the threes and twos...

148
00:08:27,781 --> 00:08:30,166
...are growing suspicious
of the fours and fives.

149
00:08:30,326 --> 00:08:33,624
All I know is that it's my birthday.

150
00:08:33,787 --> 00:08:37,845
What if we give these people
something to believe in again?

151
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,127
- Koogler?
- Hey.

152
00:08:39,293 --> 00:08:41,263
I know what you guys think of me,
okay?

153
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:44,303
"Hey, it's Koogler. You know, he's cool.

154
00:08:44,465 --> 00:08:46,802
He likes to get laid. He's not that old."

155
00:08:47,551 --> 00:08:51,348
I'm a five because I know what the twos
and the threes need. What do we need?

156
00:08:52,515 --> 00:08:53,689
Entertainment.

157
00:08:53,849 --> 00:08:55,486
A talent show.

158
00:08:55,643 --> 00:08:58,442
An event where threes and twos
can rise and fall.

159
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:01,701
- Helps people believe in the system.
- Give my spot to someone else.

160
00:09:01,857 --> 00:09:04,740
I don't wanna be a five.
I was happy as a three. I'm miserable.

161
00:09:04,902 --> 00:09:07,785
Oh, dear Abed. So humble.

162
00:09:11,909 --> 00:09:13,879
You people are monsters.

163
00:09:14,036 --> 00:09:17,833
Well, if there's nothing else, then.
Speak.

164
00:09:17,998 --> 00:09:19,209
Headline items.

165
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:22,388
Twos broke into a supply closet
and stole a box of peanut butter.

166
00:09:22,545 --> 00:09:25,095
The futurization of the campus decor
is almost complete.

167
00:09:25,256 --> 00:09:28,388
And a few hours ago,
Jeff Winger became a four.

168
00:09:28,551 --> 00:09:31,054
That's nice.

169
00:09:41,397 --> 00:09:42,738
You there, girl.

170
00:09:42,898 --> 00:09:44,405
How many MeowMeowBeenz?

171
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:47,455
Two.

172
00:09:47,736 --> 00:09:50,417
- Two? Are you lost, Two?
- Yes.

173
00:09:51,073 --> 00:09:52,794
Are you lost, Two?

174
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:55,251
I'll escort her to the common area.

175
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:59,088
- You're a four? I don't recognise you.
- He's new Beenz.

176
00:10:00,082 --> 00:10:01,256
Bye-bye, new Beenz.

177
00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:05,178
Threes and twos must leave Building 1
after 7.

178
00:10:05,337 --> 00:10:08,267
Building 1 after 7 is fours only.

179
00:10:08,424 --> 00:10:10,595
- What are you doing?
- How goes the revolution?

180
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:12,052
I can't break a four.

181
00:10:12,219 --> 00:10:14,853
It's impossible to get any higher
without half the fives.

182
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:17,268
- They got this thing locked up.
- They're nervous.

183
00:10:17,433 --> 00:10:20,232
They're hosting a talent show
to prove anyone can be a five.

184
00:10:20,394 --> 00:10:23,242
If you enter, you'll be centre stage
with all eyes on you...

185
00:10:23,397 --> 00:10:26,494
...and you can tell everyone
this isn't democracy.

186
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:27,778
This is tyranny.

187
00:10:28,777 --> 00:10:30,070
Can you put some mustard...?

188
00:10:30,237 --> 00:10:33,831
I shouldn't have to put mustard
on my face for this to make sense.

189
00:10:33,991 --> 00:10:35,961
You know
we have to take this system down.

190
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:46,305
You know, I once loved a two.

191
00:10:48,797 --> 00:10:50,435
Matthew.

192
00:10:50,633 --> 00:10:52,852
He was my everything.

193
00:10:53,761 --> 00:10:56,975
But numbers change.

194
00:11:00,809 --> 00:11:03,443
I'll keep your secret, new Beenz.

195
00:11:11,695 --> 00:11:12,823
It says you're next.

196
00:11:12,988 --> 00:11:15,159
Now, Jeffrey,
I beg you not to take this risk.

197
00:11:15,324 --> 00:11:16,416
You know what they say.

198
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:20,169
Fives have lives, fours have chores,
threes have fleas, twos have blues...

199
00:11:20,329 --> 00:11:22,915
...and ones don't get a rhyme
because they're garbage.

200
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:24,802
Craig, I got this.

201
00:11:34,969 --> 00:11:37,021
No. No, please.

202
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:39,683
Not The Outlands! Please!

203
00:11:39,849 --> 00:11:41,355
Boo on you!

204
00:11:41,517 --> 00:11:43,736
The fives have spoken.

205
00:11:43,894 --> 00:11:46,030
And you...

206
00:11:47,565 --> 00:11:49,985
...are not very good and...

207
00:11:53,445 --> 00:11:55,285
What? No! Please!

208
00:11:55,447 --> 00:11:59,374
I'm just not very good
at public speaking and...

209
00:12:00,703 --> 00:12:02,044
Last chance, Jeffrey.

210
00:12:02,204 --> 00:12:03,925
Showtime.

211
00:12:14,216 --> 00:12:15,390
My name is Jeff Winger.

212
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,730
I recently became a four.

213
00:12:17,887 --> 00:12:22,276
Funny thing is, when I was a two...

214
00:12:22,725 --> 00:12:24,896
...I didn't actually have any less.

215
00:12:27,354 --> 00:12:30,487
But I did have a lot of crazy friends.

216
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:35,573
Hey, my name's Tommy Talouca.
I'm from hallway C. I'm a two.

217
00:12:35,738 --> 00:12:40,080
I gotta get to the cafeteria
before they run out of apples.

218
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:44,044
What is with twos and apples?

219
00:12:44,205 --> 00:12:46,755
You're given three kinds of fruit.
Mix it up.

220
00:12:48,751 --> 00:12:50,922
Then you become a four.

221
00:12:51,086 --> 00:12:54,016
And you get that... That four walk.

222
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:56,937
You know what I'm talking about?
It's like one of these.

223
00:12:58,552 --> 00:13:00,937
And they got a little trail
of twos behind them...

224
00:13:01,096 --> 00:13:03,861
...and they're like,
"Hey, is there an apple up there?"

225
00:13:08,812 --> 00:13:10,900
What else is going on?

226
00:13:11,065 --> 00:13:12,821
He's killing it.

227
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:17,782
There came a time
when I has to ask myself...

228
00:13:17,947 --> 00:13:20,415
...did I even wanna be a three?

229
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,210
Or did I just hate myself
for being a two?

230
00:13:25,913 --> 00:13:26,957
I don't know.

231
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:30,461
All I know is...

232
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,759
...I sure do love them apples!

233
00:13:51,981 --> 00:13:55,694
Oh, the Koog approogs. That's a five.

234
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:02,166
Yeah!

235
00:14:04,326 --> 00:14:07,838
Review, review! Meow, meow, meow!

236
00:14:07,997 --> 00:14:11,425
Review, review! Meow, meow, meow!

237
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:13,470
Down here, guys.

238
00:14:13,836 --> 00:14:15,675
- Yeah, yeah.
- Can I get a picture?

239
00:14:15,838 --> 00:14:18,009
I want my future kids
to know this happened.

240
00:14:18,174 --> 00:14:20,309
I admire your optimism, Garrett.

241
00:14:22,678 --> 00:14:24,517
- What the hell?
- I don't wanna hear it.

242
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,401
I got this far to take Shirley down.

243
00:14:26,557 --> 00:14:30,816
- What about everyone else?
- Look around you. Everyone wanted this.

244
00:14:31,353 --> 00:14:32,777
Fives only, ma'am.

245
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:34,694
Oh, great. Come on.

246
00:14:34,857 --> 00:14:37,538
You... You think
this system's gonna last forever?

247
00:14:37,693 --> 00:14:39,200
I'm gonna free people's minds.

248
00:14:39,361 --> 00:14:41,663
I'm a psych major.
Words are my weapons.

249
00:14:41,822 --> 00:14:44,373
I'm a security guard.
Weapons are my weapons.

250
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:58,887
Welcome, fives,
to the inaugural fancy future dance.

251
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:12,071
I'm glad you don't think
making Jeff a five was a mistake.

252
00:15:12,228 --> 00:15:13,818
I believe in taking risks.

253
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:15,569
Yeah. Jeff's really cool.

254
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:18,407
Couldn't help but notice...

255
00:15:18,567 --> 00:15:21,830
...that Shirley didn't clap with
the rest of you after my performance.

256
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:23,827
Is she always so different?

257
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:25,745
I can't concentrate
on the dance moves.

258
00:15:25,908 --> 00:15:30,084
You don't believe the rumours, do you,
that Jeff manipulated his way to the top?

259
00:15:30,246 --> 00:15:32,215
Shirley, I can hear what you're saying.

260
00:15:32,373 --> 00:15:35,587
You're trying to manipulate someone
into thinking I'm manipulative.

261
00:15:35,751 --> 00:15:37,507
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

262
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,350
No one knows
what you're talking about.

263
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:44,100
Do you wanna have this conversation,
or just keep flexing your veiny arms...

264
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,099
...and throwing out apples?

265
00:15:46,637 --> 00:15:49,057
Tranquillity is advancement.

266
00:15:49,223 --> 00:15:51,358
A happy three is a future four.

267
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:56,026
Twos and Threes, you're accepting
a life you don't have to live.

268
00:15:57,815 --> 00:16:00,698
Stand up for yourselves!

269
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,615
Really?

270
00:16:04,405 --> 00:16:07,952
- Fine. Give me that.
- Hey.

271
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:13,006
You're all alive.

272
00:16:13,164 --> 00:16:16,260
You are all alive.

273
00:16:16,417 --> 00:16:21,138
Look at the mustard on my face,
but listen to my words.

274
00:16:21,297 --> 00:16:23,302
- You're one of the angriest...
- You're angry.

275
00:16:23,465 --> 00:16:25,019
The rules got changed on you.

276
00:16:25,176 --> 00:16:27,394
You can't just be cool
and be in charge now.

277
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:30,768
No, you have to gossip and give out
food and make people feel guilty.

278
00:16:30,931 --> 00:16:34,111
Okay, yeah. I bust my ass
making a world full of selfish idiots...

279
00:16:34,268 --> 00:16:35,312
...remember my name.

280
00:16:35,477 --> 00:16:38,824
Call it hard work, but don't tell me
the system measures who's nice.

281
00:16:38,981 --> 00:16:40,784
Actually, it kind of does.

282
00:16:45,488 --> 00:16:49,498
Security, banish them to The Outlands
with the rest of the ones.

283
00:16:49,658 --> 00:16:52,672
- No! No! No!
- Okay, okay, okay.

284
00:16:53,204 --> 00:16:58,673
Ladies and gentlemen, please put your
tray tables in their party positions.

285
00:16:58,834 --> 00:17:00,341
So sayeth Captain Koogler.

286
00:17:01,128 --> 00:17:04,177
Actually, keep the tray tables
where they are, Koogler.

287
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:06,511
The rule of the fives is over.

288
00:17:06,675 --> 00:17:09,475
Long live the review-lution!

289
00:17:09,637 --> 00:17:10,811
No!

290
00:17:10,971 --> 00:17:12,182
That comes down?

291
00:17:12,348 --> 00:17:15,729
- Okay, all right, all right, all right.
- All right.

292
00:17:25,027 --> 00:17:27,661
- Happy?
- Are you happy?

293
00:17:27,822 --> 00:17:29,874
I knew you couldn't go
to that stupid dinner.

294
00:17:30,032 --> 00:17:32,832
- That's why I didn't invite you.
- It's nice to be invited.

295
00:17:32,993 --> 00:17:34,666
Sure, if you're a control freak.

296
00:17:34,829 --> 00:17:36,549
Oh, and you clearly hate control.

297
00:17:36,705 --> 00:17:39,671
No. I love it.

298
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:45,851
I guess it's easy to pretend
that you don't when you got it.

299
00:17:46,924 --> 00:17:48,347
You'd think we'd be better friends...

300
00:17:48,509 --> 00:17:51,357
...because we're big fans of
the same thing.

301
00:17:52,388 --> 00:17:54,227
You there. Ones.

302
00:17:54,390 --> 00:18:00,523
You are permitted back indoors
by decree of Britta, the Mother of Ones.

303
00:18:01,897 --> 00:18:04,401
And do I hear correctly that as a five...

304
00:18:04,567 --> 00:18:07,829
...you felt you could park
in handicap spots?

305
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:10,834
Well, you see,
that's just part of the Koogler style.

306
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,959
It's human-crap style.

307
00:18:13,117 --> 00:18:15,288
Rate him.

308
00:18:17,037 --> 00:18:19,089
Okay, well, that's low.

309
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:26,849
All fives must be cleansed of
their five filth and reduced to oneness.

310
00:18:28,215 --> 00:18:31,976
Jeff. Hey, Shirley. I'm not a five
anymore. I'm a one like everyone else.

311
00:18:32,136 --> 00:18:33,773
I'm like everyone else.

312
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:35,021
Who's next?

313
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:37,945
All right, time to pull the plug.

314
00:18:38,267 --> 00:18:39,690
Oh, great Mother of Ones...

315
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:42,025
...mustard-faced saviour...

316
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:45,865
...there is still a five hiding among us
that has not been cleansed.

317
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:49,453
Nonsense.
All fives were reduced to oneness...

318
00:18:49,612 --> 00:18:52,115
...in the great purge
of about two minutes ago.

319
00:18:52,281 --> 00:18:53,953
This five cheats.

320
00:18:54,116 --> 00:18:59,289
It never registered, yet was given a five
from outside the system.

321
00:19:01,248 --> 00:19:02,802
Behold.

322
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,465
The MeowMeowBeenz app.

323
00:19:05,294 --> 00:19:07,133
Its beta test ended days ago.

324
00:19:07,296 --> 00:19:11,519
It's now available in the app store,
99 cents.

325
00:19:11,675 --> 00:19:13,431
Five stars.

326
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:16,105
This five lied to us...

327
00:19:16,263 --> 00:19:18,814
...used us, judged us...

328
00:19:18,974 --> 00:19:21,655
...yet exempts itself from judgment.

329
00:19:24,146 --> 00:19:28,406
It's selling our information to spammers
because I am getting a lot more e-mail...

330
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:32,494
...and trust me,
my penis needs no enlargement.

331
00:19:32,655 --> 00:19:36,451
So how do you cleanse a five
that's unregistered?

332
00:19:36,617 --> 00:19:38,254
Delete it.

333
00:19:47,628 --> 00:19:49,929
By the way, guys, it's a Saturday.

334
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:52,888
You're all in school for nothing.
Go home and get some sleep.

335
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:54,936
- No.
- No.

336
00:19:55,511 --> 00:19:58,014
No! No. Wait.

337
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,020
No, don't go! Where are you going?

338
00:20:03,352 --> 00:20:05,155
No.

339
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:07,361
Attention, Greendale.

340
00:20:07,523 --> 00:20:11,829
I'd like to propose we forget everything
that happened over the last few days.

341
00:20:11,986 --> 00:20:15,533
I don't anticipate a lot of pushback
on that. I think we're all embarrassed.

342
00:20:15,698 --> 00:20:17,418
- Hey there.
- Oh, hey.

343
00:20:17,575 --> 00:20:20,623
So I was thinking about checking out
this new restaurant tonight.

344
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:22,542
Oh, that's sweet, but I can't tonight.

345
00:20:22,705 --> 00:20:26,667
Not even takeout?
We could eat in the study room.

346
00:20:26,834 --> 00:20:31,259
Oh, I think I have time for that, Jeffrey.

347
00:20:32,089 --> 00:20:33,263
What?

348
00:20:33,424 --> 00:20:35,476
I'm not gonna take it off.

349
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:39,692
I still got two days left on the rental.

350
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:45,777
Every once in a while,
a film comes along...

351
00:20:45,936 --> 00:20:49,567
...that takes a serious look
at higher education.

352
00:20:49,732 --> 00:20:51,285
This is not one of them.

353
00:20:51,442 --> 00:20:53,079
Gentlemen...

354
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,618
...assume the party.

355
00:20:54,778 --> 00:20:57,578
This summer, fun has a new name.

356
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,914
- Koogler?
- Koogler!

357
00:20:59,074 --> 00:21:00,166
- Koogler.
- Koogler!

358
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:02,580
- Koogler.
- Koogler! Koogler!

359
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:06,250
Hope you don't mind if I play through.

360
00:21:06,415 --> 00:21:09,594
Hammer Road Pictures invites you
to meet the man, the myth...

361
00:21:09,752 --> 00:21:11,424
I'm photocopying my rear end.

362
00:21:11,587 --> 00:21:13,758
- ...the Koogler.
- Koogler.

363
00:21:13,923 --> 00:21:18,099
I guess I have what you might call
an aversion to education.

364
00:21:19,553 --> 00:21:21,274
Do you even have a career plan?

365
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:24,527
- Yeah, does getting laid count?
- No!

366
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:28,444
Mitchell D. Hurwitz is Koogler,
Rated R.
