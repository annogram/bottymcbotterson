1
00:00:05,612 --> 00:00:07,773
Raisins don't belong
in a chocolate chip cookie.

2
00:00:07,981 --> 00:00:08,970
It gives them depth.

3
00:00:09,183 --> 00:00:10,172
Hey, watch it, punk.

4
00:00:10,384 --> 00:00:13,319
What are you, 80?
He's trying to bring back disco.

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,717
I don't have to be old
to know it's not gonna happen.

6
00:00:18,358 --> 00:00:21,054
What it is, soul brother.

7
00:00:21,261 --> 00:00:23,559
My boys are gonna make me
breakfast in bed for Mother's Day.

8
00:00:23,764 --> 00:00:26,597
I'm gonna make breakfast and get in
bed, but they're gonna bring it to me.

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,960
Aw.
Aw.

10
00:00:28,168 --> 00:00:29,897
I know. They said
the cutest thing last night.

11
00:00:30,104 --> 00:00:31,799
They said, "Mama,"
they call me Mama...

12
00:00:32,005 --> 00:00:34,599
You're gonna be the fun police.
If I'm the fun police,

13
00:00:34,808 --> 00:00:36,435
then you're director
of Funland Security.

14
00:00:38,045 --> 00:00:39,672
Good, more of this.
More of what?

15
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,848
What do you think?
The constant bickering.

16
00:00:42,049 --> 00:00:43,448
It was cute at first, but...

17
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:47,108
Well, Abed explains it best.
Jeff and Britta is no Ross and Rachel.

18
00:00:47,321 --> 00:00:50,757
Your sexual tension, lack of chemistry
are putting us on edge, ironically,

19
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:53,483
on every level,
you're keeping us from being friends.

20
00:00:53,694 --> 00:00:55,491
Jeff and I
do not have sexual tension.

21
00:00:55,696 --> 00:00:56,924
We just argue all the time.

22
00:00:57,131 --> 00:00:59,224
Oh, just like Sam and Diane.

23
00:00:59,433 --> 00:01:00,627
I hated Sam and Diane.

24
00:01:00,834 --> 00:01:03,530
Who are Sam and Diane?
Okay, we get it. You're young.

25
00:01:03,737 --> 00:01:05,432
Sorry.
See what you're doing to us?

26
00:01:05,639 --> 00:01:07,834
Want my advice?
Pork her and move on.

27
00:01:08,575 --> 00:01:10,167
We did it all the time in my day.

28
00:01:10,377 --> 00:01:12,868
Yeah, you also put hydrogen
in blimps, that was bad.

29
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,206
Hey, everybody.

30
00:01:14,915 --> 00:01:18,646
Just a reminder.
Our Spring Fling is on the quad today.

31
00:01:18,852 --> 00:01:21,184
Music, food, activities. What, what?

32
00:01:21,655 --> 00:01:22,883
He makes me uncomfortable.

33
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:24,882
Still in the room.

34
00:01:25,425 --> 00:01:28,394
There's also going to be a game
of Paintball Assassin

35
00:01:28,595 --> 00:01:30,324
with a prize for last man standing.

36
00:01:30,531 --> 00:01:32,522
Or last man in a wheelchair
with no paint.

37
00:01:32,733 --> 00:01:33,722
Or last woman.

38
00:01:33,934 --> 00:01:36,562
Give it a rest, Britta.
What's the prize?

39
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:39,500
It was a Blu-ray DVD player,
but it was stolen.

40
00:01:39,706 --> 00:01:41,230
So now it's TBD.

41
00:01:41,441 --> 00:01:43,739
I want TBD. Is that new?

42
00:01:43,944 --> 00:01:45,878
If it's what I think,
I had it in the '70s.

43
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,913
Let's get back to Britta and Jeff.
There's no Britta and Jeff.

44
00:01:50,117 --> 00:01:51,379
He said, fully erect.

45
00:01:51,818 --> 00:01:55,481
I'm gonna let you guys figure this out
while I go take a nap in my car.

46
00:02:00,394 --> 00:02:01,520
What are you waiting for?

47
00:02:43,971 --> 00:02:45,871
What the hell?

48
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,881
Hello?

49
00:03:09,997 --> 00:03:11,589
What is going on?

50
00:03:11,798 --> 00:03:13,993
The paintball game was starting,

51
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:19,264
and the dean...
The dean announced the prize.

52
00:03:19,973 --> 00:03:21,463
The prize.

53
00:03:22,142 --> 00:03:24,667
We turned on each other
like animals.

54
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:26,743
What was the prize?
Was?

55
00:03:26,947 --> 00:03:28,380
This is not over.

56
00:03:28,582 --> 00:03:31,449
This is still happening right now.

57
00:03:33,387 --> 00:03:36,879
Leonard? Leonard, I'm not playing.

58
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,650
Everyone's playing.

59
00:03:49,703 --> 00:03:51,364
Aw.

60
00:03:51,571 --> 00:03:54,131
You suck.

61
00:03:58,545 --> 00:04:01,241
Come with me if
you don't want paint on your clothes.

62
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:11,857
Hey. Look what I found
wandering the neutral zone.

63
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,055
Jeff Winger.

64
00:04:16,596 --> 00:04:17,722
You son of a bitch.

65
00:04:19,132 --> 00:04:21,123
I thought you were dead, man.

66
00:04:22,102 --> 00:04:23,228
I was just taking a nap.

67
00:04:23,437 --> 00:04:26,167
Has everyone lost their mind?
It's just a game of paintball.

68
00:04:26,373 --> 00:04:27,465
Yeah. With one rule.

69
00:04:27,674 --> 00:04:31,041
Last man standing gets the prize.
The prize.

70
00:04:31,244 --> 00:04:33,804
The prize.
What is this prize?

71
00:04:36,483 --> 00:04:37,472
You don't know.

72
00:04:39,453 --> 00:04:42,479
Priority registration.
Priority registration?

73
00:04:43,123 --> 00:04:46,115
That's why everyone's running
around like a bunch...

74
00:04:47,527 --> 00:04:49,017
Does that mean what I think?

75
00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:52,460
Like you could have first choice
of your classes next semester?

76
00:04:55,402 --> 00:04:56,494
Easy, sugar bear.

77
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:59,263
But you could schedule
all your classes on a Monday

78
00:04:59,473 --> 00:05:00,906
and take a six-day weekend.

79
00:05:01,108 --> 00:05:03,008
You could do a lot of things.

80
00:05:03,577 --> 00:05:06,774
Talk him through the hunger.
Every student wants that prize, Jeff.

81
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,414
No way to share it,
so we'll all turn on each other.

82
00:05:09,616 --> 00:05:11,709
But the longer we wait
to do that... Jeff.

83
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:14,113
The longer we work together,
the longer we last.

84
00:05:14,321 --> 00:05:15,515
Everyone running in packs?

85
00:05:15,722 --> 00:05:17,747
Debate team was first,
they fell to infighting.

86
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,449
The glee club is luring stragglers
into sniper traps

87
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,252
with cheery renditions of songs.

88
00:05:22,462 --> 00:05:23,451
Really?

89
00:05:23,663 --> 00:05:25,290
And people fall for that?
Yeah.

90
00:05:25,499 --> 00:05:28,900
I mean, I'm all for winning,
but let's not resort to cheap ploys.

91
00:05:32,773 --> 00:05:33,933
Are the girls in the game?

92
00:05:34,141 --> 00:05:35,631
Britta?
No, I don't mean Britta.

93
00:05:35,842 --> 00:05:37,309
Did I say Britta?
Twice now.

94
00:05:38,845 --> 00:05:40,278
Chess Club.

95
00:05:41,047 --> 00:05:42,878
No, no, no.

96
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,880
He's a pawn.

97
00:05:53,994 --> 00:05:56,053
Checkmate, bitches.

98
00:06:00,934 --> 00:06:04,097
And tell the drama club
their tears will be real today.

99
00:06:07,674 --> 00:06:09,904
No, that's all sugar, man.
Get some protein.

100
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,099
Right here. Peanuts.

101
00:06:11,311 --> 00:06:13,336
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Peanuts, peanuts.

102
00:06:13,547 --> 00:06:15,981
No, take the stuff out closer to you.
No, no.

103
00:06:16,183 --> 00:06:17,878
The ones in the back
are the freshest.

104
00:06:18,084 --> 00:06:20,075
That will keep us going. Yeah.

105
00:06:20,287 --> 00:06:21,345
Hey.

106
00:06:21,555 --> 00:06:23,716
What the hell?
I got you covered, bro.

107
00:06:23,924 --> 00:06:25,858
You guys formed an alliance
without me?

108
00:06:26,059 --> 00:06:27,959
Yeah. You with Star-Burns?

109
00:06:28,862 --> 00:06:30,022
Not if I can be with you.

110
00:06:33,099 --> 00:06:34,088
It's just Star-Burns.

111
00:06:34,301 --> 00:06:35,598
Anyone else need a pee break?

112
00:06:35,802 --> 00:06:36,791
Yeah.
Yeah.

113
00:06:37,304 --> 00:06:38,396
Hey.
Hey.

114
00:06:38,638 --> 00:06:40,469
I'll stand guard.
I don't need to pee.

115
00:06:40,674 --> 00:06:42,733
I'm wearing a diaper for the game.
Oh, yeah.

116
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,501
For the game.

117
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,114
Hey, guys, make this quick before
Pierce's chewing attracts enemies.

118
00:07:11,771 --> 00:07:14,035
Um, guys?
Hold it.

119
00:07:14,241 --> 00:07:15,299
Don't move.
Drop it.

120
00:07:26,653 --> 00:07:28,712
All right, everybody, be cool.

121
00:07:28,922 --> 00:07:31,755
We can beat the others if we merge.
We're doing fine.

122
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:33,823
You win the game
camped on a crapper?

123
00:07:34,027 --> 00:07:35,051
Worked on you.
Did it?

124
00:07:35,262 --> 00:07:37,196
You have a gun in your face?
Matches yours.

125
00:07:37,397 --> 00:07:39,365
Nice comeback.
Shut up.

126
00:07:39,566 --> 00:07:41,727
Jeez.
Jeez.

127
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:51,904
Okay.

128
00:07:52,112 --> 00:07:53,704
So the agreement is we're allies

129
00:07:53,914 --> 00:07:56,644
until we're sure
we're the last seven standing.

130
00:07:58,585 --> 00:08:00,416
You thinking what I'm thinking?
Mm-hm.

131
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,212
Our team's walking with God.

132
00:08:02,422 --> 00:08:05,016
I'm thinking we might already
be the only seven left,

133
00:08:05,225 --> 00:08:07,716
in which case,
this is a window for the two of us

134
00:08:07,928 --> 00:08:09,088
to take out the others.

135
00:08:09,296 --> 00:08:11,958
Real nice, Troy, that'd be
great PR for the black students.

136
00:08:12,165 --> 00:08:14,463
I am not an ambassador.

137
00:08:15,101 --> 00:08:16,363
I am gladiator.

138
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:19,038
Now, you want to win or not?

139
00:08:19,239 --> 00:08:20,866
Oh!

140
00:08:21,074 --> 00:08:23,304
Troy made God mad.

141
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,410
Take cover.

142
00:08:27,447 --> 00:08:28,607
Run, Pierce.

143
00:08:36,323 --> 00:08:38,621
Glee club.
How do you know it's the glee club?

144
00:08:38,825 --> 00:08:40,315
Listen.

145
00:08:42,829 --> 00:08:44,888
♪ Hit me with your best shot ♪♪

146
00:08:45,098 --> 00:08:46,395
Oh, brother.

147
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,535
That is so uninspired.

148
00:08:50,203 --> 00:08:51,465
I'm not so sure.

149
00:08:53,907 --> 00:08:55,841
I got a plan. Get ready.

150
00:08:56,776 --> 00:08:57,765
Hey, Pierce.

151
00:08:57,978 --> 00:09:00,378
Don't come over here, okay?

152
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,571
Screw you. I'm coming over there.

153
00:09:06,353 --> 00:09:07,945
Medic.

154
00:09:08,154 --> 00:09:09,280
In the trees. There.

155
00:09:21,935 --> 00:09:24,927
Write some original songs.

156
00:09:27,273 --> 00:09:29,764
What are you gonna do
if you win priority registration?

157
00:09:29,976 --> 00:09:32,171
I'll make my schedule airtight.

158
00:09:32,379 --> 00:09:34,574
Maybe get out of here
in 3 years instead of 4.

159
00:09:34,781 --> 00:09:38,740
I'd take any class with no tests
and no papers.

160
00:09:39,185 --> 00:09:40,675
What would you do, Shirley?

161
00:09:40,887 --> 00:09:42,718
I'd choose all morning classes

162
00:09:42,922 --> 00:09:45,686
so I could get home early
to spend some time with my boys.

163
00:09:45,892 --> 00:09:48,190
It's hard being away from them
so much.

164
00:09:48,762 --> 00:09:49,751
You know what?

165
00:09:49,963 --> 00:09:53,330
I say if any of us win, we give it
to Shirley as a Mother's Day gift.

166
00:09:53,533 --> 00:09:55,125
Absolutely.
What?

167
00:09:55,335 --> 00:09:56,859
Abed, you don't have to do that.

168
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:00,836
I am so sick of you guilting people
with your phony humanitarian shtick.

169
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:03,339
Phony?
When I win, you can watch me do it.

170
00:10:03,543 --> 00:10:05,568
Of course,
but that won't make it less phony.

171
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:09,215
You'd be a lot more likeable...
If I never did anything for anybody?

172
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:12,613
Yeah. Because when you help people,
that always turns out great.

173
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:14,179
Let's do it.

174
00:10:16,289 --> 00:10:17,256
Shh.

175
00:10:17,457 --> 00:10:19,152
Study group.

176
00:10:19,359 --> 00:10:21,554
Come out and play.

177
00:10:21,761 --> 00:10:25,322
Oh, look, it's post-ironic Disco Stu.
You still trying to bring it back?

178
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,160
Hi.

179
00:10:29,636 --> 00:10:31,729
Damn, he brought it back.

180
00:10:35,542 --> 00:10:36,702
Put your hands in the air.

181
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:40,175
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

182
00:10:50,724 --> 00:10:52,191
They shot us.

183
00:10:52,392 --> 00:10:55,486
It's hot, it's hot. Let's go, fool.

184
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:04,566
The last guy almost got me.

185
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,568
My legs.

186
00:11:15,815 --> 00:11:18,875
Oh, Shirley, I'm so sorry.

187
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,384
I'm going home, Britta.

188
00:11:21,588 --> 00:11:23,579
I know, Shirley, I know.

189
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:26,020
No, seriously, I'm going home.
Can you help me up?

190
00:11:26,226 --> 00:11:28,660
Oh. Yeah, sure.

191
00:11:43,843 --> 00:11:46,141
Shirley, I'm gonna win
for you and your boys.

192
00:11:46,346 --> 00:11:47,574
That's nice.

193
00:11:47,781 --> 00:11:51,114
Shirley, I'm gonna win that prize,
but not for you and your boys.

194
00:11:51,317 --> 00:11:52,614
That's less nice.

195
00:11:53,486 --> 00:11:55,454
Oh, my God, you've been hit.
What?

196
00:11:55,655 --> 00:11:56,849
Oh, no.

197
00:11:57,056 --> 00:11:58,546
Wait, wait.

198
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:01,026
It's blood.

199
00:12:02,162 --> 00:12:04,221
I thought it was paint,
but I'm just bleeding.

200
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,193
Talk about luck.

201
00:12:08,201 --> 00:12:11,329
I can't believe this game
is still going on. It's 2 a.m.

202
00:12:11,538 --> 00:12:13,597
What if someone gets hurt
and the police come?

203
00:12:13,807 --> 00:12:15,468
They'll think I'm a bad dean.

204
00:12:16,776 --> 00:12:19,301
There's classes in the morning.
This has to stop.

205
00:12:19,512 --> 00:12:21,605
Shh.

206
00:12:22,749 --> 00:12:25,445
Put me in the game,
because I'll take everyone out.

207
00:12:25,652 --> 00:12:28,120
I play paintball
three times a week, bro.

208
00:12:28,321 --> 00:12:30,653
I'm one of the douches
who brings his own equipment.

209
00:12:30,857 --> 00:12:33,052
But it wouldn't be fair.
You're not a student.

210
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:36,251
But you can change that,
can't you? Huh?

211
00:12:36,462 --> 00:12:38,521
Enroll me in a class.

212
00:12:49,776 --> 00:12:51,710
What are your interests?
Arts and crafts.

213
00:12:51,911 --> 00:12:53,378
Oh, I do watercolors.
Oh, cool.

214
00:12:58,351 --> 00:13:00,444
The group would be thrilled.

215
00:13:00,653 --> 00:13:03,816
The wounded soldier fantasy means
we're moments from doing it, right?

216
00:13:04,023 --> 00:13:08,653
Yeah, can you feel that tension?
It's a miracle we still have clothes on.

217
00:13:10,196 --> 00:13:12,426
You're right, you know.

218
00:13:12,632 --> 00:13:14,827
I am a phony.

219
00:13:15,301 --> 00:13:18,429
I try to act compassionate,
because I'm afraid that I'm not.

220
00:13:18,638 --> 00:13:20,970
Oh, please, I invented phony.

221
00:13:21,174 --> 00:13:22,607
You care about people.

222
00:13:22,809 --> 00:13:26,074
I accuse you of faking to convince
myself I'm not such a jerk.

223
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:29,248
Jeff, you help people more than I do,
and you don't even want to.

224
00:13:29,449 --> 00:13:31,883
You're not a jerk. You're fine.

225
00:13:33,853 --> 00:13:36,481
Especially now that I've repaired
your overworked torso

226
00:13:36,689 --> 00:13:38,384
with my trembling
feminine fingers.

227
00:13:38,591 --> 00:13:41,059
Yes. Too much sexual tension.

228
00:13:41,261 --> 00:13:42,785
Damn bursting.

229
00:13:44,764 --> 00:13:48,097
It would totally serve them right
if we did it here in the study room.

230
00:13:48,301 --> 00:13:50,565
God, could you imagine?
I can't stop imagining.

231
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:51,964
Neither can I.

232
00:14:02,348 --> 00:14:05,476
We should get dressed before
the third-shift librarian shows up.

233
00:14:05,685 --> 00:14:08,711
<i>Yeah, we don't want this to turn
into a letter to Penthouse, right?</i>

234
00:14:08,922 --> 00:14:11,982
I think the group is right.
We did need to relieve some tension.

235
00:14:16,062 --> 00:14:18,656
Tell me you didn't have sex with me
to win at paintball.

236
00:14:18,865 --> 00:14:21,356
No, I had sex with you,
and I'm gonna win at paintball.

237
00:14:21,567 --> 00:14:23,091
Don't be gross.
I'm gross?

238
00:14:23,303 --> 00:14:26,067
You seem pretty practiced
at putting on panties one-handed

239
00:14:26,272 --> 00:14:27,330
while holding a gun.

240
00:14:28,441 --> 00:14:31,433
Can I get dressed
before you assassinate me?

241
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:36,947
So all that happened,
it meant nothing to you?

242
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:40,017
I didn't say that.
What did it mean to you?

243
00:14:40,219 --> 00:14:41,652
I asked you first.
Very mature.

244
00:14:41,854 --> 00:14:44,914
Said the woman wearing Hello Kitty.
Said the woman holding the gun.

245
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:48,359
You sure that's a gun?

246
00:14:48,561 --> 00:14:51,257
Because maybe it's a metaphor
for your fake, jaded persona.

247
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:54,332
Uh-oh.

248
00:14:54,534 --> 00:14:56,832
No paintballs, Hans?
What do you think, I'm stupid?

249
00:14:57,036 --> 00:14:58,697
When'd you take it?
When you started seducing.

250
00:14:58,938 --> 00:15:01,463
I wasn't though. Assuming that
makes you way grosser.

251
00:15:01,674 --> 00:15:03,266
Not when I'm right.

252
00:15:30,136 --> 00:15:34,573
<i>Buenos dias, children.
You'll be happy to know you made it till the end.</i>

253
00:15:34,774 --> 00:15:36,469
You're not even a student.
Wrong.

254
00:15:36,676 --> 00:15:40,043
Critical Media Literacy
and Politics of Gender, biatch.

255
00:15:44,584 --> 00:15:47,075
Give me your clip.
Oh, that would be brilliant of me.

256
00:15:47,286 --> 00:15:49,584
Look, you got the drop on me. I lost.

257
00:15:49,789 --> 00:15:51,814
Let me do this for you.

258
00:15:59,265 --> 00:16:01,324
Be pretty crazy
if I shot you right now, huh?

259
00:16:36,402 --> 00:16:37,562
What's so funny, Chang?

260
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:41,228
Maybe it's the fact there's no such
thing as priority registration.

261
00:16:41,441 --> 00:16:45,104
Or maybe it's this.

262
00:16:45,711 --> 00:16:47,645
Ta-da.

263
00:17:12,338 --> 00:17:14,363
Dean.

264
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:18,099
Just one moment.

265
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,406
Oh, hi there, Jeffrey.

266
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:26,546
That's a good look for you.

267
00:17:26,752 --> 00:17:29,585
Everybody out there
is shooting each other

268
00:17:29,789 --> 00:17:35,022
for nothing while you sit here
in your ivory tower.

269
00:17:35,228 --> 00:17:37,492
Jeffrey, I can explain.

270
00:17:37,697 --> 00:17:40,530
I messed up
when I promised priority registration.

271
00:17:40,733 --> 00:17:42,894
It's a violation
of some student equality act,

272
00:17:43,102 --> 00:17:47,129
but this isn't. Ta-da!

273
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:50,741
Okay, now, it's not Blu-ray, but it
comes with its own remote, so...

274
00:17:54,981 --> 00:17:55,970
Jeffrey.

275
00:17:58,985 --> 00:18:00,612
Jeffrey.

276
00:18:01,487 --> 00:18:02,784
Jeffrey.

277
00:18:02,989 --> 00:18:04,650
Jeffrey.

278
00:18:12,165 --> 00:18:14,565
You get it all out of your system?

279
00:18:21,974 --> 00:18:23,669
Almost.

280
00:18:28,147 --> 00:18:31,139
What do you want from me, Jeffrey?
Guess.

281
00:18:39,158 --> 00:18:41,285
Oh, hi.
Hey, how's it going?

282
00:18:41,494 --> 00:18:43,655
You still have some paint.

283
00:18:43,863 --> 00:18:44,921
Oh, thanks.

284
00:18:45,131 --> 00:18:47,224
Um, I was thinking...
You don't have to.

285
00:18:47,433 --> 00:18:49,128
It didn't happen. It's not a mistake.

286
00:18:49,335 --> 00:18:51,769
It didn't happen.
It was a crazy night of paintball.

287
00:18:51,971 --> 00:18:53,233
Exactly. Tension relieving.

288
00:18:53,439 --> 00:18:55,407
Absolutely. No need
to mention it to anyone.

289
00:18:55,608 --> 00:18:58,475
Right, no big deal.
Nothing's changed.

290
00:18:59,312 --> 00:19:01,075
Something's changed.

291
00:19:01,581 --> 00:19:04,175
Oh, Abed. Crazy Abed.

292
00:19:04,383 --> 00:19:05,941
No, something's different now.

293
00:19:06,152 --> 00:19:08,848
Could be me. Sporting a man-thong.
Maybe.

294
00:19:09,055 --> 00:19:12,252
Or maybe it's that I
have emerged victorious

295
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:16,027
with a priority registration form.

296
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,120
Well done, Jeff.

297
00:19:19,332 --> 00:19:23,098
And in recognition of her bravery,
not to mention her children,

298
00:19:23,302 --> 00:19:27,739
I hereby award this
to the best soldier, Shirley.

299
00:19:28,174 --> 00:19:30,108
Now, the bad news is,
for legal purposes,

300
00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:33,369
next semester,
if anybody asks, you have gout.

301
00:19:33,579 --> 00:19:35,547
Do you mind walking with a limp?
Mm.

302
00:19:35,748 --> 00:19:38,114
Thank you, Jeffrey.
Look, Annie.

303
00:19:38,718 --> 00:19:41,744
Wow, I didn't see that coming.
Neither did I.

304
00:19:41,954 --> 00:19:43,353
So no one feels it?

305
00:19:43,556 --> 00:19:45,717
No one senses anything's different?
Nope.

306
00:19:45,925 --> 00:19:46,983
Not at all.

307
00:19:47,193 --> 00:19:49,286
It's riding up a little.

308
00:20:01,073 --> 00:20:03,837
Hey, Abed, it's Troy.
I'll meet you at the flagpole in...

309
00:20:05,211 --> 00:20:08,476
<i>If you are satisfied
with your message, press one.</i>

310
00:20:08,681 --> 00:20:11,081
<i>To erase and re-record...
Hey, Abed, it's Troy.</i>

311
00:20:11,284 --> 00:20:14,685
Yo, I'll meet you at the flagpole
in like...

312
00:20:14,887 --> 00:20:16,752
<i>If you are satisfied
with your message...</i>

313
00:20:16,956 --> 00:20:20,119
Hey, Abed.
It's Troy. Heh-hooh.

314
00:20:20,326 --> 00:20:22,226
<i>If you are satisfied
with your message...</i>

315
00:20:22,428 --> 00:20:24,362
In how many minutes
are you gonna meet him?

316
00:20:24,563 --> 00:20:25,689
Ten minutes.

317
00:20:25,898 --> 00:20:27,195
