1
00:00:01,134 --> 00:00:03,898
Something for the committee
to put on the radar: Insurance.

2
00:00:04,053 --> 00:00:06,059
- What about it?
- School needs some.

3
00:00:06,222 --> 00:00:07,776
- I can ask on the street.
- What?

4
00:00:07,932 --> 00:00:10,613
Oh, too cool for street insurance?
Must be nice.

5
00:00:10,768 --> 00:00:13,901
My sister wants to know what I'm
bringing to my grandson's birthday.

6
00:00:14,063 --> 00:00:16,993
I'm sensing an emergency
collage situation.

7
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,653
I wasn't invited.
My son had a kid three years ago.

8
00:00:19,819 --> 00:00:22,323
I barely get to see him
on major holidays.

9
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:25,169
I mean,
who in the hell does he think he is?

10
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:28,919
- You saw your son at his wedding.
- No, that's Furio, my gay son. Him, I get.

11
00:00:29,078 --> 00:00:31,415
Hank's a knob,
doesn't have any hobbies, interests.

12
00:00:31,581 --> 00:00:35,591
All he does is play... What do you call
that crap with dungeons and dragons?

13
00:00:35,752 --> 00:00:37,839
- "Dungeons and Dragons"?
- That's the crap.

14
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:40,341
- I know that game.
- We play "Dungeons and Dragons."

15
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:45,181
Guys, let's play "D&D"
to help Hickey reconnect with his son.

16
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:49,142
Was everyone's takeaway last time that
we use "D&D" to reprogram brains?

17
00:00:49,307 --> 00:00:50,814
Not that we almost caused a suicide?

18
00:00:50,975 --> 00:00:55,198
We prevented one.
Fa... bulous Neil felt like a nobody.

19
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:59,317
And thanks to us, he's still out there,
doing this and that in the background.

20
00:00:59,484 --> 00:01:00,907
Satisfying sequel's difficult.

21
00:01:01,069 --> 00:01:03,370
Many geniuses defeated themselves
through hubris.

22
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,784
Making this a chance to prove
I'm better. I'm in!

23
00:01:05,949 --> 00:01:08,535
All in favour of a game
of "Dungeons and Dragons"...

24
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:11,122
...to reunite Hickey
and his son tomorrow night?

25
00:01:11,287 --> 00:01:12,675
Aye!

26
00:01:12,831 --> 00:01:18,050
Well, okay. It's short notice,
but I think it'll be good for me.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,074

28
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:31,016
So, Dad...

29
00:01:31,182 --> 00:01:32,570
...I'm just curious.

30
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:34,647
What is it
about "Dungeons and Dragons"...

31
00:01:34,811 --> 00:01:37,528
...that suddenly leapt out at you
at age 60?

32
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:41,153
Dungeons. It'd be the dungeons.

33
00:01:41,317 --> 00:01:42,361
Let's begin.

34
00:01:42,527 --> 00:01:46,074
A blood orange sunrise crests
the peaks of Rage Mountain...

35
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,410
...as you arrive
at the troubled Galindor.

36
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:50,414
Ahead to the north, a bridged ravine.

37
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:53,673
Beyond that, a mysterious black tower
where, rumour has it...

38
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,131
...an evil necromancer dwells.

39
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:59,008
Your goal: Reach the top
and destroy the necromancer...

40
00:01:59,169 --> 00:02:02,052
...freeing the realm from his evil magic.

41
00:02:02,213 --> 00:02:04,764
Oh, that's just what I love
about role-playing games...

42
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:07,605
...is being told exactly what to do.

43
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,766
- Me too.
- You should introduce yourselves.

44
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,103
I am...

45
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:14,692
Oh, boy. Joseph Gordon Diehard.
Really?

46
00:02:14,851 --> 00:02:16,405
Son of Sir Riggs Diehard.

47
00:02:16,561 --> 00:02:20,441
Well, I'm Sir Riggs Diehard, so I guess
I'm your dad in the game too.

48
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:23,241
- Oh, my God, so cool.
- Isn't that weird?

49
00:02:23,401 --> 00:02:25,453
Oh, boy. Guys, I don't suppose...

50
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:28,292
...this is some contrived
paint-by-numbers adventure...

51
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:30,749
...that's designed to force
an emotional bond...

52
00:02:30,909 --> 00:02:34,337
...between me and my emotionally
stunted father, is it?

53
00:02:34,496 --> 00:02:37,544
- No way, Jose.
- What?

54
00:02:37,707 --> 00:02:41,219
I got an idea. Why don't we just
sort of reshuffle all these...

55
00:02:41,377 --> 00:02:43,798
...redistribute them.
Yeah, just mix them up a bit.

56
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:45,304
I don't think...

57
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:46,758
And here we go.

58
00:02:46,925 --> 00:02:50,436
Hello, everyone.
I am Tristram Steelheart.

59
00:02:50,595 --> 00:02:53,395
I'm a holy cleric with a mace
and a dumb name.

60
00:02:54,933 --> 00:02:59,737
I'm Tiny Nuggins, a thief,
and the rest is gibberish.

61
00:02:59,896 --> 00:03:03,277
Greetings, I am Fibrosis the Ranger.

62
00:03:03,441 --> 00:03:06,324
I'm Crouton, the half-orc Druid.
Druid?

63
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:07,743
Oh, Crouton.

64
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,826
Hector the Well-Endowed? Again?

65
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:13,750
You think that's a weird coincidence?
I'm a troll named Dingleberry.

66
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,796
That's my mom's nickname for me.

67
00:03:15,954 --> 00:03:17,875
I'm who Hickey was,
Sir Riggs Diehard.

68
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:23,805
I am Joseph Gordon, son of Riggs.

69
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,926
"I protect the blade of Diehard...

70
00:03:26,089 --> 00:03:29,054
...a family sword whose power
knows no equal.

71
00:03:29,217 --> 00:03:33,440
In our clan, the leader carries the hilt,
his eldest heir, the blade...

72
00:03:33,596 --> 00:03:36,729
...for we believe
man's greatest weapon against evil...

73
00:03:36,891 --> 00:03:38,647
...is the bond...

74
00:03:39,477 --> 00:03:42,028
Is the bond between father and son."

75
00:03:44,482 --> 00:03:46,036
What would you guys like to do?

76
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:49,823
We should cross the bridge
and head for the black tower. Huzzah?

77
00:03:49,988 --> 00:03:51,494
- Huzzah?
- Huzzah.

78
00:03:51,656 --> 00:03:54,041
I don't know if I'm gonna head
across the bridge.

79
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,881
What else is out there?
What's south or east or west?

80
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,544
How about it, Aziz?

81
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:01,386
I walk too far south,
do I fall off your graph paper there?

82
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,633
You can head south.

83
00:04:02,792 --> 00:04:05,556
I've generated some details
about the surrounding area.

84
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:09,259
You know, for God's sakes, Hank,
it's been five seconds.

85
00:04:09,424 --> 00:04:11,808
- Can you not do this?
- Hey, you tell me.

86
00:04:11,968 --> 00:04:13,391
Are we losing?

87
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:17,065
No. It's not a competition.
The only winner is fun.

88
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:19,145
We're having fun.

89
00:04:19,309 --> 00:04:22,856
I go to Tristram, and I'm laughing...

90
00:04:23,021 --> 00:04:27,244
...and I pick him up,
and I carry him to the bridge. It's fun.

91
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,907
Hector is trying to lift you.

92
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:31,405
I cast "Torvin's Flesh of Fire."

93
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:35,995
Tristram murmurs an incantation.

94
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:40,880
His body becomes wreathed in white
hot flame, burning Hector for...

95
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:42,082
Six damage.

96
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:44,752
- Hey!
- Hector, that's called self-defence.

97
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:47,552
Tristram's spell
has caught the bridge on fire.

98
00:04:47,712 --> 00:04:49,883
The ropes snap
causing the bridge to twist.

99
00:04:50,048 --> 00:04:52,598
I'm rolling dexterity checks
to see if you all hold on.

100
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,179
Abed, considering the bigger picture...

101
00:04:55,345 --> 00:04:59,900
...you think it might be possible you
miscalculated the bridge strength?

102
00:05:00,058 --> 00:05:02,526
Would've been constructed
in the third age by goblins.

103
00:05:02,685 --> 00:05:04,358
They used primitive iron anchors.

104
00:05:04,521 --> 00:05:07,902
Ropes are yanked on both sides and
you all plummet into the ravine below.

105
00:05:08,066 --> 00:05:09,407
- Abed!
- Oh, no.

106
00:05:09,567 --> 00:05:11,370
- What?
- Abed!

107
00:05:11,528 --> 00:05:14,292
You plunge into the icy,
raging waters of Skull River.

108
00:05:15,073 --> 00:05:16,793
- What?
- You know, what's your problem?

109
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,373
- What?
- You didn't invite me...

110
00:05:18,535 --> 00:05:20,456
- ...to Sebastian's birthday.
- I knew it!

111
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,091
Who hoards a man's grandson?

112
00:05:22,247 --> 00:05:24,334
He's not your grandson. He's my son.

113
00:05:24,499 --> 00:05:28,639
And I didn't invite you to the birthday
party because I wanted to enjoy it.

114
00:05:30,338 --> 00:05:34,598
You know, fathers and sons,
there is a lot of power between them.

115
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:36,432
- Yes.
- Stop it.

116
00:05:36,594 --> 00:05:40,474
And I spent a long time
letting that power...

117
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,653
...push me away from my dad,
and I regret it.

118
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,447
So, what's ever between you guys...

119
00:05:45,603 --> 00:05:47,739
...will only get fixed
when you're together.

120
00:05:47,897 --> 00:05:49,155
They're not together.

121
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:51,486
- Not helping!
- Be a bad Dungeon Master if I was.

122
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:54,949
Jeff, Hickey, Annie, Shirley,
washed down the left fork of the river...

123
00:05:55,113 --> 00:05:56,323
...others to the right.

124
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,331
Father!

125
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:01,339
If you're gonna continue,
Hank, Britta, Chang, Dean Pelton...

126
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:04,211
- ...go into a different room.
- We're not going to continue.

127
00:06:04,372 --> 00:06:06,840
Thank you very much, guys.
This was just awesome.

128
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,503
Yeah, wait, wait.
I'll play your dragon game with you.

129
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:14,011
But let's make it interesting.
If I kill the necrophile before you do...

130
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:17,472
...I come to my grandson's birthday.
We'll settle it like men.

131
00:06:17,635 --> 00:06:19,937
Or whatever you call the guys
that play this.

132
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,938
Okay.

133
00:06:22,098 --> 00:06:27,864
But if I kill the necromancer
before you do...

134
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:31,283
...then you don't go to Christmas
or Thanksgiving at Aunt Rachel's.

135
00:06:31,441 --> 00:06:33,031
You don't even go to that.

136
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:34,865
Yeah, but I will if you don't.

137
00:06:36,112 --> 00:06:38,200
- Okay, fine.
- Okay.

138
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:39,705
Let the real game begin.

139
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:51,881
I will find you!

140
00:06:55,465 --> 00:06:58,051
Well, I'm assuming
you guys can help me beat him...

141
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:01,231
...because if we lose, I'm gonna punch
each of you in the heart.

142
00:07:06,142 --> 00:07:09,571
You awaken on a riverbank, surrounded
by treacherous, godforsaken...

143
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:11,200
...non-zip line vacation jungle.

144
00:07:11,356 --> 00:07:14,321
I build a fire
and construct a crude wooden rack...

145
00:07:14,484 --> 00:07:16,536
...to dry my boots
and oversized codpiece.

146
00:07:16,694 --> 00:07:20,917
And I can make some s'mores out of
horse meat and s'more horse meat.

147
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:23,245
Build a fire? Horse s'mores?
Screw this.

148
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:26,838
- The river runs east. I head west.
- Tiny Nuggins scampers into the jungle.

149
00:07:26,996 --> 00:07:31,718
Hey, I didn't scamper in the jungles
of Nicaragua and I won't do it now.

150
00:07:31,876 --> 00:07:33,798
- Wait, come back. I follow him.
- Me too.

151
00:07:33,962 --> 00:07:36,679
Tiny Nuggins, if we rest,
we'll regain our strength.

152
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,014
And lose my family.

153
00:07:38,174 --> 00:07:41,188
I'll imaginary sleep
when I'm imaginary dead.

154
00:07:41,344 --> 00:07:43,848
In the distance,
you notice a patrol of hobgoblins.

155
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:46,767
- Hobgoblins?
- Larger, stronger, and worth more...

156
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:49,401
- ...in Scrabble than regular goblins.
- Get down.

157
00:07:49,561 --> 00:07:52,408
I punch him in the heart
and I keep running.

158
00:07:52,564 --> 00:07:55,032
There are no women with them,
are there? I got class.

159
00:07:55,191 --> 00:07:57,161
You charge,
alerting them to your presence.

160
00:07:57,318 --> 00:07:59,205
You attack the nearest one
in the chest.

161
00:07:59,362 --> 00:08:00,952
- You miss and fall down.
- What?

162
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:03,415
Hobgoblins are heading toward
Nuggins with spears.

163
00:08:03,575 --> 00:08:06,458
Oh, no. I cast "Entangle" on them.

164
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:08,340
Crouton the Druid waves her arms...

165
00:08:08,496 --> 00:08:12,756
...causing grass, vines and branches
to entangle the limbs of...

166
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:14,800
Four hobgoblins.

167
00:08:16,045 --> 00:08:18,300
The two free hobgoblins fire arrows
at Crouton.

168
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:19,971
One pierces her shoulder.

169
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:21,556
The other her chest.

170
00:08:21,718 --> 00:08:23,390
I fire an arrow at them.

171
00:08:24,179 --> 00:08:25,602
Hit.

172
00:08:26,723 --> 00:08:29,487
Hobgoblins don't like their odds.
They bolt into the jungle.

173
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:30,935
Yeah, you better run.

174
00:08:31,102 --> 00:08:35,574
Go find a name that's not just
another creature's name plus "hob."

175
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:40,321
- Crouton?
- I'm here.

176
00:08:40,904 --> 00:08:43,584
She was badly wounded
from her fall in the Skull River...

177
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,457
...and the arrows were just too much.
I'm sorry.

178
00:08:47,702 --> 00:08:49,125
That's it? Is she dead?

179
00:08:49,287 --> 00:08:50,841
Yes, that's it, Hickey.

180
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,124
I'm dead.

181
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,678
But it's okay.

182
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,221
I'm on your side.

183
00:08:55,376 --> 00:08:57,263
Which is why I'm dead.

184
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,631
And I may be gone...

185
00:08:58,796 --> 00:09:02,143
...but just remember whenever
the wind whispers through the woods...

186
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,686
...you got me killed.

187
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:11,689
Now, you listen to me, young man.

188
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:14,355
I've punched about a thousand hearts
in my life.

189
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:18,317
- I never, never missed.
- You ever been a 3-foot tall half ling...

190
00:09:18,483 --> 00:09:22,160
...running through 2-foot high vines
trying to punch a 7-foot monster?

191
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:24,997
I'm gonna check the others.
Check your character.

192
00:09:25,156 --> 00:09:28,205
Or just kind of generally take this game
seriously. Your son does.

193
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:34,460
I take a moment of silence
to mourn my fallen comrade, Crouton...

194
00:09:34,624 --> 00:09:37,721
...before rifling through her belongings.

195
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:43,180
- My father?
- No way to know where the others are.

196
00:09:43,341 --> 00:09:45,927
You're still travelling north
along narrow cliff edges...

197
00:09:46,094 --> 00:09:48,478
...of Hawthorne Mountains.
I'll roll for encounters.

198
00:09:48,638 --> 00:09:51,188
I'd like to cast a healing spell
on Fibrosis.

199
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:53,232
Thank you.

200
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:56,406
But I'm not gonna help you
kick your dad out of your life.

201
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:58,568
I don't think
this competition is healthy.

202
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:00,986
I don't think what you did back there
was cool.

203
00:10:01,151 --> 00:10:04,912
You think I'm the bad guy because
I didn't invite him to my son's birthday.

204
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,578
But you know where he was...

205
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,579
...for most of my birthdays?

206
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:11,707
Little place that rhymes
with "not there."

207
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,709
Times Square?

208
00:10:14,873 --> 00:10:16,463
You hear an ominous screeching.

209
00:10:16,624 --> 00:10:21,548
Moving upward into view, three huge,
white arachnids with eagle wings.

210
00:10:21,713 --> 00:10:22,887
Sky Spiders.

211
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:28,432
I draw my sword, and I cry out,
"Back, eight-legged demons!

212
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:32,771
I will not scoop you up with a catalogue
and let you outside on this day!"

213
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:35,269
Stay your blade, Joseph Gordon.

214
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:38,532
Sky Spiders are as frightened of us
as we are of them.

215
00:10:38,688 --> 00:10:40,444
Plus, they eat all the sky mosquitoes.

216
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:43,953
I cast "Speak with Monsters,"
and I say:

217
00:10:44,819 --> 00:10:47,868
"Hello. You're looking well."

218
00:10:49,157 --> 00:10:52,372
The lead spider bends four knees
and twitches its hairy ovipositor...

219
00:10:52,535 --> 00:10:55,632
...rhythmically secreting
and retracting a giant droplet...

220
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:57,295
Or drop... of silk.

221
00:10:57,665 --> 00:10:58,958
Fibrosis, as a ranger...

222
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,806
...you recognise this as the arachnid
signal of submission.

223
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:03,720
Nice work, Tristram.

224
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,261
Damn, you made that Sky Spider
your bitch, yo!

225
00:11:10,386 --> 00:11:12,392
You've tracked the hobgoblins
to this shack.

226
00:11:12,555 --> 00:11:14,810
One guard hob-guards.
What they call guarding.

227
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:16,564
- Go.
- Sniper arrow on the guard.

228
00:11:16,726 --> 00:11:17,984
Strikes true. Guard drops.

229
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:21,110
- I move to the doorway, detect traps.
- None detected.

230
00:11:21,272 --> 00:11:22,483
- I enter.
- Left flank.

231
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:23,990
- Right!
- One, facing east.

232
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,491
- Backstab.
- Double damage.

233
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:28,155
He's dead.
Footsteps behind the door to the north.

234
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:29,579
I notch two arrows.

235
00:11:29,739 --> 00:11:32,954
- Climb the walls, get above the door.
- Goblins enter from the north.

236
00:11:33,117 --> 00:11:34,410
- I fire.
- Both arrows hit.

237
00:11:34,577 --> 00:11:36,499
- Cleave!
- You kill one and wound another.

238
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:38,466
I drop on the last one and grapple.

239
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,877
- You got a hold of him.
- This one is for Crouton.

240
00:11:41,042 --> 00:11:42,596
With his dying breath, he utters:

241
00:11:42,752 --> 00:11:46,762
"The dark lord will kill you all."

242
00:11:46,923 --> 00:11:48,560
Wait, these things can talk?

243
00:11:48,716 --> 00:11:50,223
I want two taken alive.

244
00:11:50,385 --> 00:11:51,595
I wanna try something.

245
00:11:51,761 --> 00:11:53,102
Hi.

246
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,485
I'm Tiny Nuggins.

247
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:59,650
I'm gonna put my dagger down
right here, so we can just talk.

248
00:11:59,811 --> 00:12:00,938
Human trash.

249
00:12:01,104 --> 00:12:03,607
Yeah, look,
I'm gonna give it to you straight.

250
00:12:03,773 --> 00:12:05,244
We're looking for a necromancer.

251
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,321
We don't need two goblins to find him.

252
00:12:07,485 --> 00:12:11,542
So between you and your friend,
who do you think's the most useful?

253
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:14,537
Man, your friend sure can talk.

254
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:16,373
Liar. He'll never turn.

255
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:18,921
Oh, yeah,
because of that famous goblin loyalty.

256
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,426
I could never drive a wedge
between you and some guy from work.

257
00:12:22,584 --> 00:12:25,965
I was best man at that guy's wedding.

258
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:28,384
Your friend says you just got married.

259
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:30,719
Congratulations.
Too bad about the food.

260
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:33,470
I hope your flesh rots in... Wait.

261
00:12:33,636 --> 00:12:34,810
What about the food?

262
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:37,272
Oh, I guess he didn't like
your wedding toast.

263
00:12:37,432 --> 00:12:38,820
Golbak said that?

264
00:12:38,975 --> 00:12:41,360
Klang doesn't approve of you and Lisa,
Golbak...

265
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,695
...and I don't get the sense
it's because of his feelings for you.

266
00:12:45,857 --> 00:12:49,784
I think about Lisa, sitting in that hole
in Darktooth Canyon...

267
00:12:49,944 --> 00:12:54,416
...with that little Frimrok and Grignog
rolling about on the wolf pelts.

268
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:57,539
Come on, between you and me,
which one do you think is yours?

269
00:12:57,702 --> 00:12:59,873
No!

270
00:13:02,832 --> 00:13:05,252
I know where the tower is.

271
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:27,701
Sky Spiders have flown you
as far as their complex religion allows.

272
00:13:27,857 --> 00:13:30,705
They set you down and express,
through intricate prancing...

273
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,115
- ...directions to the tower.
- Yes.

274
00:13:35,156 --> 00:13:36,959
Father, forgive me.

275
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:39,335
I have travelled so far from you.

276
00:13:39,494 --> 00:13:42,792
How many game days
since the Skull River ripped us apart?

277
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:45,803
How many real hours
since I've gone pee?

278
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:47,300
We seek this necromancer.

279
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,058
Why? Why?

280
00:13:50,213 --> 00:13:53,677
Our reasons are dreams,
our dreams, dust.

281
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:57,514
I send word on wings of sparrows...

282
00:13:58,263 --> 00:14:00,980
...in hopes they might find you.

283
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:04,819
Abed says the odds
are near impossible.

284
00:14:05,103 --> 00:14:07,322
That's enough for me.

285
00:14:09,524 --> 00:14:13,155
Should you receive this message,
I know of a way to reunite.

286
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:14,956
According to my character sheet...

287
00:14:15,113 --> 00:14:18,494
...if I rub the blade of our magic
family sword while you rub the hilt...

288
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:22,419
...twin beacons of light
will reveal our locations to each other.

289
00:14:22,579 --> 00:14:25,758
Each night,
I will think of you and rub...

290
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,762
...praying for the night
fate will find us rubbing together.

291
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,926
Your son, Joseph Gordon Diehard.

292
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:44,189
Something strange has happened.

293
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:46,944
A sparrow lands
on Riggs Diehard's shoulder.

294
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:48,481
It carries a note.

295
00:14:57,238 --> 00:15:00,750
"Abed, I rub my sword's hilt"?

296
00:15:00,909 --> 00:15:02,996
Beam of light shoots up
from your location...

297
00:15:03,161 --> 00:15:05,047
...as the hilt of Diehard
seeks its blade.

298
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:08,752
The beam arcs and meets an equal
beam in the woods to the north.

299
00:15:08,917 --> 00:15:10,304
Is that where the others are?

300
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,631
Yes, 10 miles away, same as you.

301
00:15:12,795 --> 00:15:14,717
So we'll be arriving at the tower...

302
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:16,553
At the same time tomorrow morning.

303
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:18,389
This began as a race.

304
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:21,019
But it may end in war.

305
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:22,811
Does anybody have a toothpick?

306
00:15:22,972 --> 00:15:25,357
I got a piece of popcorn
stuck in my tooth.

307
00:15:25,517 --> 00:15:28,565
Like, right under the gum.
I've been trying like for 15 minutes...

308
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:32,074
...with, you know, my tooth
and then with my tongue and my finger.

309
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:34,818
I'm always one tooth off,
and I just can't seem to...

310
00:15:34,984 --> 00:15:37,286
Oh, hello, there we go. Anyway...

311
00:15:37,445 --> 00:15:40,209
But it may end in war.

312
00:15:49,499 --> 00:15:51,504
Maybe after all we've been through...

313
00:15:51,668 --> 00:15:53,887
...we should just call this thing off.

314
00:15:54,045 --> 00:15:55,931
What, you think that's up to us?

315
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:59,601
You've seen the way he talks to me,
doesn't want his father in his life.

316
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,607
He'll do anything to win,
and that includes attacking you.

317
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:05,526
And you best believe
that your little friends in there...

318
00:16:05,682 --> 00:16:07,272
...are drinking up his Kool-Aid.

319
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:10,696
This is a man who thinks
of grandchildren like trophies.

320
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:15,407
Which is why he'll play to win.

321
00:16:15,817 --> 00:16:17,454
And why I can't let him.

322
00:16:22,031 --> 00:16:25,875
Rise, brave, sweet Dingleberry.

323
00:16:26,035 --> 00:16:27,589
Rise.

324
00:16:27,745 --> 00:16:30,296
Both parties have arrived
at the black tower.

325
00:16:32,417 --> 00:16:33,461
Hi, guys.

326
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:35,714
- Father.
- Joseph Gordon.

327
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:41,179
We are here so Tristram Steelheart,
Lord of the Sky Spiders...

328
00:16:41,342 --> 00:16:44,605
...can slay the necromancer. You cool
or are we gonna have to get red?

329
00:16:44,762 --> 00:16:47,977
Tiny Nuggins, Waterboarder of Goblins,
will do the slaying...

330
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:51,439
...because every man has the right
to hang out with his grandson.

331
00:16:51,603 --> 00:16:52,896
Too bad you're outnumbered.

332
00:16:53,062 --> 00:16:54,569
No, they're not.

333
00:16:54,939 --> 00:16:56,779
I'm not part of this.

334
00:16:56,941 --> 00:16:58,697
I am Joseph Gordon Diehard...

335
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,909
...and I am only here to hug my father,
which I now do.

336
00:17:02,071 --> 00:17:03,163
It's a trick!

337
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:05,743
- I'm not letting him hug me.
- I hug my father!

338
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:08,673
- He has gunpowder in his pants.
- I draw my sword. Stay back!

339
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:10,335
- I draw an arrow.
- So do I!

340
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:12,003
Troll sound!

341
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:13,339
- Lower your sword?
- No!

342
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,003
- Dean, are you...?
- I hug my father!

343
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:17,759
You're impaled.

344
00:17:31,935 --> 00:17:33,322
Worth it.

345
00:17:33,478 --> 00:17:34,866
Good Lord.

346
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:36,279
Son slayer!

347
00:17:36,439 --> 00:17:38,029
- I attack Jeff!
- Arrow at Chang!

348
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:40,362
- Arrow at Annie!
- I head for the door.

349
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:42,164
So do I!

350
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,040
- Taste the blade of Diehard!
- I run!

351
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:45,953
- Turn a snake into a rope!
- Two arrows!

352
00:17:46,115 --> 00:17:48,002
- Spear, spear!
- I take the kid, pop him.

353
00:17:48,159 --> 00:17:51,338
- Three damage.
- Lightning bolt, lightning bolt!

354
00:17:51,496 --> 00:17:53,715
Heal our moderate wounds!

355
00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:57,800
- I spray all over them.
- I hold Britta's face in a puddle.

356
00:17:57,961 --> 00:17:59,882
- Seven damage.
- Cleave, cleave, cleave!

357
00:18:00,255 --> 00:18:04,135
- I fire two arrows.
- I drink from the Chalice of Knowing.

358
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,349
Dingleberry smash!

359
00:18:07,512 --> 00:18:11,902
- Plus three, demonic eye look.
- Pull and shove it up them!

360
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:14,194
After that,
I put one right behind the ear.

361
00:18:14,352 --> 00:18:16,238
I fire two...

362
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,902
Sir Riggs, hand in character sheet.

363
00:18:28,992 --> 00:18:30,913
- Top floor, one door.
- I open it.

364
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:32,714
- "Flame Strike."
- You did already.

365
00:18:32,871 --> 00:18:34,045
- Mace!
- Okay. Missed.

366
00:18:34,205 --> 00:18:36,839
- Hit him with a throwing dagger.
- Used all your knives.

367
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,219
What?
Will one of you guys take care...?

368
00:18:39,377 --> 00:18:41,845
- What? You're all dead? I keep going.
- I follow.

369
00:18:42,005 --> 00:18:43,926
You've reached
the necromancer's workshop.

370
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:46,938
You see his bed, bottles of goop,
some necromancing crap...

371
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:48,434
...but no necromancer.

372
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:51,394
I search. Can I search
or are you gonna stab me in the back?

373
00:18:51,556 --> 00:18:54,059
Hey, I am a thief, not a wuss.
I search too.

374
00:18:55,226 --> 00:18:57,445
You find a secret door.
It's easy, already open.

375
00:18:57,604 --> 00:19:00,866
It leads to a ladder which goes
straight down to another open door...

376
00:19:01,024 --> 00:19:03,788
- ...on the back of the tower.
- Man. Way to go.

377
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:05,533
That's great. He just got away.

378
00:19:05,695 --> 00:19:08,376
Hey, you can't just say he's gone.
You owe us an ending.

379
00:19:09,657 --> 00:19:11,164
I owe you nothing.

380
00:19:11,326 --> 00:19:12,832
I am a Dungeon Master.

381
00:19:12,994 --> 00:19:15,711
I create a boundless world,
and I bind it by rules.

382
00:19:15,872 --> 00:19:17,877
Too heavy for a bridge? It breaks.

383
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:21,138
Get hit? Take damage. Spend an hour
outside someone's front door...

384
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:24,557
...fighting over who gets to kill him?
He leaves through the back.

385
00:19:24,714 --> 00:19:27,811
He's out there. You might find him,
if you get your crap together.

386
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:30,304
Hey, guys.
Take it from a bunch of ghosts.

387
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,023
This is no kind of life.

388
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,434
You need fresh air and frozen yogurt.

389
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:36,818
It's on me. Hug it out.

390
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:38,816
- Gag me.
- Who even uses that phrase?

391
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:40,485
I'm climbing down the ladder.

392
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:43,446
- I'm gonna find this guy.
- I stay and search the workshop.

393
00:19:43,608 --> 00:19:46,325
- Any stuff there that can heal me?
- Some potions.

394
00:19:46,486 --> 00:19:47,993
Okay, well, I get half of that.

395
00:19:48,154 --> 00:19:49,661
You just went down the ladder.

396
00:19:49,823 --> 00:19:51,828
I can...
Can I hear him looting upstairs?

397
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:53,498
Not if I move about silently.

398
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:57,088
Fine, fine. If I heal you,
can we divide the potions?

399
00:19:57,247 --> 00:19:59,833
Okay, but I decide who gets what.

400
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:01,839
Fine, but we've gotta be wary of traps.

401
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:03,294
- Wand of Orcus.
- I don't...

402
00:20:03,461 --> 00:20:04,635
What's going on?

403
00:20:04,796 --> 00:20:09,305
- Give me a... I'm up to here with you.
- Want to get the necromancer or not?

404
00:20:09,467 --> 00:20:11,188
Do they like each other now?

405
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:14,441
Are you kidding me? They can't stand
being in the same room.

406
00:20:14,597 --> 00:20:16,982
I also don't think
they can handle being apart.

407
00:20:17,142 --> 00:20:23,358
And I think they just found a way
to avoid doing either.

408
00:20:26,776 --> 00:20:30,039
And that's the best
most fathers and sons can do.

409
00:20:31,114 --> 00:20:32,621
You've made me so proud today.

410
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:38,247
- Know where we can buy a real sword?
- Oh, Jeffrey.

411
00:20:45,378 --> 00:20:48,676
You're still at the entrance
to the Chamber of Grief.

412
00:20:50,884 --> 00:20:52,556
Your move, Mr. Tickles.

413
00:20:55,722 --> 00:20:59,399
You successfully pour more tea
into Count Frogula's cup.

414
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:02,407
That puts it at Hillary Rodham Kitten.

415
00:21:02,562 --> 00:21:06,572
Okay, you attempt to pass crumpets.

416
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:09,867
You fail.

417
00:21:10,028 --> 00:21:13,789
I'm getting frustrated. If you take a look
at your inventories, you'll see...

418
00:21:13,948 --> 00:21:15,372
Abed, are you almost done?

419
00:21:15,533 --> 00:21:17,206
I can't sleep without my stuffies.

420
00:21:17,368 --> 00:21:19,171
Fine. Hold on.

421
00:21:20,246 --> 00:21:23,011
Oh, a goblin notices you
and murders you all. You're dead.

422
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:24,720
They're all yours.

423
00:21:25,305 --> 00:21:31,588
