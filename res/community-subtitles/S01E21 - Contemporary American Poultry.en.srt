1
00:00:10,543 --> 00:00:12,110
I don't want to be late
for lunch.

2
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:13,879
"amar" is "to love," right?

3
00:00:13,946 --> 00:00:15,613
Oh!
Speaking of love,

4
00:00:15,681 --> 00:00:18,082
Shirley, how's it going
with the sexy dreadlock guy?

5
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,284
Oh, I'm sure I don't
have a chance with him.

6
00:00:20,352 --> 00:00:22,337
Abed and I talked to him
by the vending machines.

7
00:00:22,405 --> 00:00:23,740
He asked about you.

8
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:25,029
He specifically asked about me?

9
00:00:25,097 --> 00:00:26,694
- Mm-hmm.
- Sure.

10
00:00:26,762 --> 00:00:28,028
When Annie brought you up,
he specifically asked,

11
00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:30,194
"who is that?"
Abed.

12
00:00:30,262 --> 00:00:32,295
- Oh.
- What? That's what he said.

13
00:00:32,362 --> 00:00:34,694
Abed, your social skills
aren't exactly streets ahead.

14
00:00:34,762 --> 00:00:36,328
You know what I mean?

15
00:00:36,395 --> 00:00:37,898
- I don't.
- You're not alone in this case.

16
00:00:37,966 --> 00:00:39,602
Pierce, stop trying
to coin the phrase,

17
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:40,944
"streets ahead."

18
00:00:41,012 --> 00:00:43,145
Trying?

19
00:00:43,213 --> 00:00:45,315
Coined and minted.

20
00:00:45,382 --> 00:00:46,954
Been there, coined that.

21
00:00:47,022 --> 00:00:49,959
"streets ahead"
is verbal wildfire.

22
00:00:50,027 --> 00:00:51,662
Does it just mean "cool,"
or is it

23
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:54,233
Supposed to be,
like, "miles ahead"?

24
00:00:54,301 --> 00:00:56,604
If you have to ask,
you're street's fine.

25
00:00:56,672 --> 00:00:58,476
Okay, we can banter
if we want to banter,

26
00:00:58,543 --> 00:01:00,645
But I'm warning you
I am leaving for lunch early.

27
00:01:00,713 --> 00:01:01,646
- Me too.
- Me three.

28
00:01:01,714 --> 00:01:02,848
Streets ahead.

29
00:01:02,917 --> 00:01:04,285
Man, you guys really love

30
00:01:04,352 --> 00:01:05,619
These stupid
chicken fingers, huh?

31
00:01:05,687 --> 00:01:07,321
Uh, they're not stupid.

32
00:01:07,389 --> 00:01:08,956
They're the only good thing
in the cafeteria.

33
00:01:09,024 --> 00:01:11,258
I haven't had one in weeks.
They run out so fast.

34
00:01:11,326 --> 00:01:13,295
If God were edible--
not that I'm catholic,

35
00:01:13,363 --> 00:01:14,430
But if it was cool to eat God,

36
00:01:14,498 --> 00:01:15,631
He'd be a chicken finger.

37
00:01:15,699 --> 00:01:16,833
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

38
00:01:16,901 --> 00:01:17,968
Well, I wouldn't know.

39
00:01:18,035 --> 00:01:19,336
I'm a vegetarian.

40
00:01:19,404 --> 00:01:20,838
- Shocker.
- Yeah.

41
00:01:20,906 --> 00:01:22,340
And if you guys knew
how they treated

42
00:01:22,407 --> 00:01:23,775
The animals
that you are eating,

43
00:01:23,842 --> 00:01:25,811
You would eat them even faster

44
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:27,013
Just to put them
out of their misery

45
00:01:27,081 --> 00:01:28,481
And then you would throw up.

46
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:30,717
I don't know.

47
00:01:30,785 --> 00:01:33,153
Maybe I'm feeling
extra protective

48
00:01:33,221 --> 00:01:34,587
Of animals today because
my cat is sick.

49
00:01:34,655 --> 00:01:36,423
- Oh, a cat?
- That's awful.

50
00:01:36,491 --> 00:01:37,857
He has diabetes.

51
00:01:37,925 --> 00:01:39,959
He can't even make it
to the litter box--

52
00:01:40,026 --> 00:01:42,193
- Chicken run!
- Whoo!

53
00:01:42,261 --> 00:01:44,329
Ow!

54
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:47,598
I'm afraid that I'm gonna
have to put her to sleep.

55
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,333
Ah, go on.

56
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:51,334
God bless you.

57
00:01:51,401 --> 00:01:52,768
Save some for me!

58
00:01:52,836 --> 00:01:54,136
Watch out!

59
00:01:54,203 --> 00:02:02,064

60
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:05,315
Oh, I can hear those fingers
calling my name.

61
00:02:05,382 --> 00:02:07,117
"Troy!
Troy!"

62
00:02:07,184 --> 00:02:08,852
Troy, did you get
my text message?

63
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,954
"did you get my text message?"

64
00:02:10,021 --> 00:02:14,892
Um, I think it's--

65
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,260
I got to stop hanging out
with her.

66
00:02:16,328 --> 00:02:18,730
She sounds like
a chicken finger.

67
00:02:18,797 --> 00:02:20,197
Again?

68
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,699
Outrageous.

69
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,400
At least apologize.

70
00:02:23,468 --> 00:02:26,669
How can you just stand
there like a mute idiot?

71
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,007
- Ooh.
- Well...

72
00:02:32,075 --> 00:02:33,442
Throat surgery
might humanize you,

73
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:34,743
But it doesn't
make this acceptable.

74
00:02:34,811 --> 00:02:35,944
So cute.

75
00:02:36,012 --> 00:02:38,613
And I don't even normally
like dreadlocks.

76
00:02:38,681 --> 00:02:42,918
Hello.

77
00:02:42,986 --> 00:02:44,820
His dreadlocks remind me
of the predator,

78
00:02:44,888 --> 00:02:47,658
Which is weird, because
you're doing the actual hunting

79
00:02:47,726 --> 00:02:51,262
And you seem invisible to him.

80
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,064
- Abed, you know what I do?
- Hmm?

81
00:02:53,132 --> 00:02:54,900
Before I talk, I ask myself,

82
00:02:54,968 --> 00:02:56,034
"what am I about to say

83
00:02:56,102 --> 00:02:58,604
And how might it affect
each person listening?"

84
00:02:58,672 --> 00:03:00,372
I'm really glad
you said that, britta.

85
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,408
The idea that you compulsively
filter yourself

86
00:03:02,476 --> 00:03:05,212
Makes your lack of flavor
kind of a flavor.

87
00:03:05,279 --> 00:03:08,348
Sorry, guys.
They ran out again.

88
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,151
Something's gotta be done.

89
00:03:13,755 --> 00:03:15,423
Hey!

90
00:03:15,491 --> 00:03:18,894
What the hell, man?

91
00:03:18,961 --> 00:03:20,929
That's half our problem
right there.

92
00:03:20,997 --> 00:03:23,532
Star-burns works the fryer
and skims fingers.

93
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,734
No way.

94
00:03:24,801 --> 00:03:25,935
He gives them to people just so

95
00:03:26,003 --> 00:03:27,804
They'll act like
he isn't star-burns

96
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,139
Well, I may not eat meat,

97
00:03:29,206 --> 00:03:31,642
But I am not gonna
eat that injustice.

98
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:32,910
Let's complain.

99
00:03:32,978 --> 00:03:34,645
If we complain,
he gets a warning

100
00:03:34,713 --> 00:03:35,779
And learns to be sneakier.

101
00:03:35,847 --> 00:03:37,248
I say we knock him out
of the kitchen

102
00:03:37,315 --> 00:03:38,983
And replace him with one
of our own

103
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,551
All in one move.

104
00:03:40,619 --> 00:03:42,086
Then we're the ones
with the chicken.

105
00:03:42,154 --> 00:03:43,521
It's like a mafia movie.

106
00:03:43,589 --> 00:03:44,922
As far back as I can remember,

107
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,524
I always wanted to be
in a mafia movie.

108
00:03:46,591 --> 00:03:47,758
Cool.

109
00:03:47,826 --> 00:03:49,393
That's exactly
what it's like, Abed,

110
00:03:49,461 --> 00:03:50,928
And you get the most
important job.

111
00:03:50,996 --> 00:03:52,162
You're gonna be fry cook.

112
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,764
We may be watching
different mafia movies.

113
00:03:53,832 --> 00:03:55,398
You worked in your
dad's restaurant, right?

114
00:03:55,466 --> 00:03:56,632
Well, you'll apply for the job

115
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,800
After we get star-burns fired.

116
00:03:57,868 --> 00:03:58,968
I don't know about that.

117
00:03:59,036 --> 00:04:00,336
I don't know about the firing.

118
00:04:00,404 --> 00:04:02,306
I think he really relies
on that income.

119
00:04:02,373 --> 00:04:03,407
Yeah, man.

120
00:04:03,475 --> 00:04:05,409
Every day you flock here
like sheep

121
00:04:05,477 --> 00:04:08,079
And wait in line for a broken
promise from a dirty system.

122
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:09,547
Back in those days, Jeff winger

123
00:04:09,615 --> 00:04:10,915
Was the guy that
made things happen.

124
00:04:10,983 --> 00:04:12,384
He always knew what to say

125
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:14,353
And he always knew when
to slap the table.

126
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,421
You want to be sheep,
keep flocking.

127
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:18,757
You want to be wolves,
form a pack.

128
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:21,160
And that was it.
It was that simple.

129
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:23,595
At that moment,
we stopped being a family

130
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:26,432
And started being a family...
In italics.

131
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:28,767
Britta got cozy
with star-burns.

132
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:30,536
- Can I touch both at--oh!
- Yeah, do 'em both.

133
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,637
He lowered his guard
and just like that,

134
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:36,975
He was gone.

135
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:39,544
I mean, the way Jeff saw it,
by not respecting us,

136
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,746
Star-burns had basically brought
it on himself.

137
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:43,949
And when his job opened up,
we did what we had to do

138
00:04:44,016 --> 00:04:46,985
To keep the list
of applicants to a minimum.

139
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:48,720
I had worked in my dad's
falafel restaurant,

140
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,355
So I had a pretty
impressive resume.

141
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:51,456
It's very impressive.

142
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:53,558
Especially your reference.

143
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:54,826
Just give 'em a call right now.

144
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:56,194
But we weren't taking
any chances.

145
00:04:56,261 --> 00:04:58,162
The fix was in.

146
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:01,332
Trump tower, this is Donald.

147
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:02,900
Well, he can deep-fry
the hell out of chicken.

148
00:05:02,967 --> 00:05:04,234
I can tell you that.

149
00:05:04,302 --> 00:05:05,702
Troy even applied
for the same job

150
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:06,903
And gave the world's
worst interview

151
00:05:06,971 --> 00:05:08,938
Just to make me look better

152
00:05:09,006 --> 00:05:10,373
And that was that.

153
00:05:10,441 --> 00:05:12,542
This was the glorious time.

154
00:05:12,609 --> 00:05:14,143
No more racing
to the cafeteria.

155
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:15,444
No more lines.

156
00:05:15,512 --> 00:05:16,845
To us, lines were for suckers,

157
00:05:16,913 --> 00:05:18,613
Hacks, sheep.

158
00:05:18,681 --> 00:05:20,848
We were wolves.

159
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:24,552
And we had the chicken
to prove it.

160
00:05:24,619 --> 00:05:26,053
- Oh.
- Ooh.

161
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,454
To victory.

162
00:05:27,522 --> 00:05:29,022
It feels unfamiliar,

163
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,523
But it tastes like chicken.

164
00:05:30,591 --> 00:05:34,060
Mm-hmm.

165
00:05:34,127 --> 00:05:35,461
Hi.

166
00:05:35,529 --> 00:05:37,430
- Hello.
- You guys are lucky.

167
00:05:37,498 --> 00:05:38,464
They're always running out.

168
00:05:38,532 --> 00:05:40,099
Would you like one?

169
00:05:40,167 --> 00:05:43,069
Name's Shirley.
Memorize it.

170
00:05:43,137 --> 00:05:44,570
I will, Shirley.

171
00:05:44,638 --> 00:05:45,571
Eee!

172
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:46,706
See that, girls?

173
00:05:46,774 --> 00:05:48,908
The universe goes
by supply and demand.

174
00:05:48,975 --> 00:05:51,877
The more you take and use,
the more it sends.

175
00:05:51,945 --> 00:05:53,245
Somebody's been taking
a little extra.

176
00:05:53,313 --> 00:05:54,380
What's in that container?

177
00:05:54,448 --> 00:05:55,448
- Eight fingers.
- Abed.

178
00:05:55,515 --> 00:05:58,617
Abed's study group.

179
00:05:58,685 --> 00:06:00,185
Why are you giving
Chang chicken?

180
00:06:00,253 --> 00:06:01,319
We have an agreement.

181
00:06:01,387 --> 00:06:02,620
But, Abed,
if you get caught skimming,

182
00:06:02,688 --> 00:06:04,889
You get fired and we all go back
to eating like britta.

183
00:06:04,957 --> 00:06:07,224
Yeah, we put you in that job.

184
00:06:07,292 --> 00:06:09,993
I dressed like a crazy pharaoh
for you, man.

185
00:06:10,061 --> 00:06:12,128
You make the fingers, Abed,
not the decisions.

186
00:06:12,196 --> 00:06:13,129
I'm sorry.

187
00:06:13,196 --> 00:06:14,530
It's okay, buddy.

188
00:06:14,598 --> 00:06:16,732
But just remember
these things have power.

189
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,967
So just let me know next time

190
00:06:18,034 --> 00:06:20,436
You have any more agreements,
all right?

191
00:06:20,504 --> 00:06:22,572
Yeah, I agreed to give Cheng
eight fingers per lunch

192
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,574
In exchange for a 10% bump
on every Spanish test

193
00:06:24,642 --> 00:06:25,842
For each of us.

194
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,345
- Oh!
- Okay.

195
00:06:28,413 --> 00:06:29,947
Abed makes the fingers
and the decisions.

196
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:31,482
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

197
00:06:35,054 --> 00:06:36,855
Oh, Abed, you're like the best.

198
00:06:40,527 --> 00:06:41,527
At greendale, they were always
out of chicken fingers,

199
00:06:41,595 --> 00:06:43,495
So whoever could get
them had power.

200
00:06:43,563 --> 00:06:45,030
Oh.

201
00:06:45,098 --> 00:06:46,164
And I was the guy in the apron,

202
00:06:46,232 --> 00:06:47,666
So I came up with a system
and pretty soon

203
00:06:47,734 --> 00:06:48,834
Half the chicken at greendale

204
00:06:48,902 --> 00:06:51,570
Was going out the side door.

205
00:06:51,637 --> 00:06:53,371
Everybody in our crew
had a job.

206
00:06:53,438 --> 00:06:55,005
T-bone was the bag man.

207
00:06:55,073 --> 00:06:56,607
He'd move the fingers
to a storeroom

208
00:06:56,675 --> 00:06:58,408
Where two of the girls
did the packaging.

209
00:06:58,476 --> 00:07:00,544
We could trust them not
to eat the supply

210
00:07:00,612 --> 00:07:01,879
Because britta was a vegetarian

211
00:07:01,946 --> 00:07:03,580
And Shirley figured
that if she stole,

212
00:07:03,648 --> 00:07:05,482
She'd go to hell.

213
00:07:05,549 --> 00:07:07,383
They'd hand the stuff
out the window to Annie.

214
00:07:07,451 --> 00:07:09,751
She was the leg man
and distributor.

215
00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:13,688
The crazy thing
was it was their food

216
00:07:13,755 --> 00:07:15,823
And we were stealing it and
giving it back to them

217
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:18,157
Like it was a big favor.

218
00:07:18,225 --> 00:07:20,893
Nobody asked any questions
because Pierce's experience

219
00:07:20,961 --> 00:07:22,460
As a ceo had taught him how

220
00:07:22,528 --> 00:07:24,196
To keep the wheels
from squeaking.

221
00:07:24,263 --> 00:07:25,764
I had it all worked out
on a schedule.

222
00:07:25,832 --> 00:07:27,865
You know, I've never been
fired from a job

223
00:07:27,933 --> 00:07:29,867
And this is, like,
my perfect job.

224
00:07:29,934 --> 00:07:31,434
I'm Mr. Chicken fingers.

225
00:07:31,502 --> 00:07:33,303
The minute before
you thought about busting us,

226
00:07:33,371 --> 00:07:36,072
That was the minute you
had a chicken in your hand.

227
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,840
Everyone had their hand out.

228
00:07:37,908 --> 00:07:40,476
Everyone wanted what we had.
Oh! Oh, well.

229
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,578
So we had anything we wanted.

230
00:07:42,645 --> 00:07:44,345
And Jeff had the most
important job of all.

231
00:07:44,413 --> 00:07:45,546
He was at the top.

232
00:07:45,614 --> 00:07:46,981
He was the boss.

233
00:07:47,048 --> 00:07:48,582
He was our leader.

234
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,484
What the hell is going on?

235
00:07:50,551 --> 00:07:52,319
A-v kids hooked it up.

236
00:07:52,386 --> 00:07:53,687
Abed supplied
the whole department

237
00:07:53,754 --> 00:07:54,753
With chicken fingers.

238
00:07:54,821 --> 00:07:55,920
You think that's good,

239
00:07:55,988 --> 00:07:57,821
Check out my posse
and Troy's monkey.

240
00:07:57,889 --> 00:08:00,456
Troy, why do you have a monkey?

241
00:08:00,524 --> 00:08:02,358
Uh, it's an animal
that looks like a dude.

242
00:08:02,426 --> 00:08:03,926
Why don't I have ten of them?

243
00:08:03,994 --> 00:08:07,596
Guys, look what Abed
scored for me.

244
00:08:07,664 --> 00:08:08,731
Ooh.

245
00:08:08,798 --> 00:08:10,064
It has a million zippers

246
00:08:10,132 --> 00:08:11,365
And it was free.

247
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,837
- Oh.
- Ooh, robot.

248
00:08:16,904 --> 00:08:18,371
I am a robot.

249
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:20,907
I am programmed
to love this backpack.

250
00:08:20,974 --> 00:08:21,974
This is insane.

251
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,542
More insane
than programming them

252
00:08:23,609 --> 00:08:25,277
To replace auto workers?

253
00:08:25,345 --> 00:08:27,011
What?

254
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:30,848
Okay, okay, if you're not
in this study group, please.

255
00:08:30,915 --> 00:08:32,115
No, no.

256
00:08:32,182 --> 00:08:33,750
That means you,
sexy dreadlocks,

257
00:08:33,817 --> 00:08:35,284
Britta's hairdresser...
What?

258
00:08:35,352 --> 00:08:37,152
Pierce's hackneyed entourage.

259
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,753
Hackneyed?

260
00:08:38,821 --> 00:08:39,854
You see the turban guy?

261
00:08:39,922 --> 00:08:41,556
Yes, in a '90s ski movie

262
00:08:41,624 --> 00:08:43,725
That featured an entourage.

263
00:08:43,792 --> 00:08:45,426
Don't you guys think this
is getting out of hand?

264
00:08:45,494 --> 00:08:46,627
Oh, we're not gonna get caught.

265
00:08:46,695 --> 00:08:48,195
We have campus security
on the take.

266
00:08:48,263 --> 00:08:49,630
Abed's got it all figured out.

267
00:08:49,697 --> 00:08:51,765
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, that's a relief.

268
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,300
Yeah, it's pretty cool
being friends

269
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:55,068
With the biggest man on campus.

270
00:08:55,136 --> 00:08:56,370
Isn't that right,
Annie's boobs?

271
00:08:57,505 --> 00:08:59,106
Please rename that thing!

272
00:08:59,174 --> 00:09:01,141
And this time, not with
a contest on Twitter.

273
00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:02,309
It's his Twitter account.

274
00:09:02,377 --> 00:09:03,577
He can do what he wants.

275
00:09:03,645 --> 00:09:04,979
They are my body parts!

276
00:09:05,047 --> 00:09:06,080
I do not consent to this!

277
00:09:06,148 --> 00:09:07,815
You know what
I don't appreciate?

278
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,153
You wouldn't threaten a monkey.

279
00:09:12,221 --> 00:09:15,124
They have more
lactic acid than us.

280
00:09:15,191 --> 00:09:16,858
Shared my chicken with him.

281
00:09:16,926 --> 00:09:17,992
- Talk to the backpack.
- I told you!

282
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,294
You're the worst, Annie.

283
00:09:19,362 --> 00:09:20,762
Streets ahead!

284
00:09:28,903 --> 00:09:30,571
Line starts behind you.

285
00:09:30,638 --> 00:09:32,339
Oh, he's cool.

286
00:09:32,407 --> 00:09:34,607
Six fingers every Wednesday.

287
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:36,108
Cool.
And what can you offer?

288
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:39,379
I have a bicycle
and I teach beginner's tennis.

289
00:09:39,447 --> 00:09:40,814
Cool.
Okay.

290
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:43,016
Six fingers wednesdays.

291
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,917
All right.

292
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:46,285
We'll be in touch, janel.

293
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:49,389
- Thank you, Abed.
- You're welcome.

294
00:09:49,457 --> 00:09:51,358
Hey, Jeff.
Hey, buddy.

295
00:09:51,426 --> 00:09:52,860
It's quite a setup
you got here.

296
00:09:52,927 --> 00:09:55,495
I'm pretty excited about it.

297
00:09:55,563 --> 00:09:56,930
It turns out everyone has needs

298
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:58,898
And everyone has functions.

299
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:00,933
Look, um, I've been thinking

300
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:02,802
Maybe I need to hit
the big red button

301
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:05,471
And bring an end
to this operation.

302
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:08,674
I mean, it's been fun,
but it's out of control now.

303
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:10,375
Am I right?
I don't know.

304
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,310
The entire campus
is controlled by our group,

305
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:13,778
Our group is controlled
by chicken,

306
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:16,247
And the chicken
is controlled by me.

307
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:17,282
Float?

308
00:10:17,349 --> 00:10:18,617
I'm good.

309
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:21,087
Abed, the mafia movie is over.

310
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:22,722
I'm not doing a mafia movie.

311
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,324
In fact, I don't need
to use movies

312
00:10:24,392 --> 00:10:26,226
Or tv shows to talk
to people anymore.

313
00:10:26,294 --> 00:10:28,128
Before, I only needed them
because the day-to-day world

314
00:10:28,196 --> 00:10:29,730
Made no sense to me, but now,

315
00:10:29,798 --> 00:10:31,231
Everyone's speaking
the same language.

316
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:32,500
Chicken.

317
00:10:32,567 --> 00:10:34,469
I understand people
and they finally understand me.

318
00:10:34,536 --> 00:10:37,038
Abed, eventually people are
gonna get tired of chicken.

319
00:10:37,105 --> 00:10:38,105
I'm tired of chicken.

320
00:10:38,173 --> 00:10:39,173
You're not tired of chicken.

321
00:10:39,241 --> 00:10:40,474
You miss the taste of control.

322
00:10:42,276 --> 00:10:43,743
Well, that's crazy.

323
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,646
Is it?

324
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,550
Unfortunately, the very thing
that drove you

325
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:52,985
To this dorm room
is what would prevent you

326
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,453
From properly running
this machine

327
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,654
Or even being a cog in it.

328
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:56,955
Your ego.

329
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:59,791
Well...

330
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:01,560
I see.
I see.

331
00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:05,198
This has been about me
the whole time.

332
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:08,601
You want a shot
at the Jeff winger throne?

333
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:11,339
You better bring
a powerful ass.

334
00:11:11,407 --> 00:11:13,941
Oh, and for your information,
I don't have an ego.

335
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:16,811
My facebook photo
is a landscape.

336
00:11:21,918 --> 00:11:24,820
You're the best, Eduardo.

337
00:11:24,888 --> 00:11:26,288
Thank you all for coming.

338
00:11:26,356 --> 00:11:27,623
Can we make this quick?

339
00:11:27,691 --> 00:11:29,558
I need to give a banana
to Annie's boobs.

340
00:11:29,626 --> 00:11:31,327
Abed is drunk
with chicken power.

341
00:11:31,395 --> 00:11:34,330
He's gone from lovable
Johnny five to evil hal.

342
00:11:34,398 --> 00:11:35,998
- Hal holb--
- not hal holbrook.

343
00:11:36,066 --> 00:11:37,033
What are you saying?

344
00:11:37,101 --> 00:11:39,469
You all have
to stop working for him.

345
00:11:39,537 --> 00:11:41,204
Let this operation dry up

346
00:11:41,272 --> 00:11:43,173
And let his wheels spin down.

347
00:11:43,241 --> 00:11:46,077
At which point you would
be in charge again, right?

348
00:11:46,145 --> 00:11:47,979
- What?
- This is so sad.

349
00:11:48,047 --> 00:11:50,516
You're jealous of Abed because
he's providing for us.

350
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:51,650
Mm-hmm.

351
00:11:51,718 --> 00:11:53,052
No, I'm concerned about Abed

352
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,454
Because he won't listen
to reason.

353
00:11:54,522 --> 00:11:55,990
Won't listen to your reason.

354
00:11:56,058 --> 00:11:57,091
Mm-hmm.

355
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:58,893
Why should he?
Jeff's so not...

356
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,828
Say "streets ahead" and die.

357
00:12:00,896 --> 00:12:03,430
Streets ahead.

358
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:05,699
You want to boss me around?

359
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:06,700
Get me an entourage.

360
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:07,900
Get Troy a monkey.

361
00:12:07,968 --> 00:12:09,235
That's what a real boss does.

362
00:12:09,303 --> 00:12:10,503
Yes.

363
00:12:10,571 --> 00:12:11,571
We probably shouldn't
even be talking to him

364
00:12:11,638 --> 00:12:12,571
Without checking with Abed.

365
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:13,939
I'm already trying him.

366
00:12:14,007 --> 00:12:15,674
He's not picking up.
What did you do with him?

367
00:12:15,742 --> 00:12:17,442
I don't believe
what greedy sellouts

368
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,344
You people turned out to be.

369
00:12:19,411 --> 00:12:20,712
I'm not gonna stand here
and be ignored.

370
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,046
Shh!
Voicemail.

371
00:12:22,114 --> 00:12:23,214
Hey, Abed.

372
00:12:23,282 --> 00:12:24,882
Jeff says you're
not listening to him.

373
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,684
Does that mean we shouldn't
listen to him either?

374
00:12:26,752 --> 00:12:29,119
Oh, also, should
we make special jackets

375
00:12:29,187 --> 00:12:30,721
For our crime family?

376
00:12:30,789 --> 00:12:33,057
Like, blazers with
chicken finger patches.

377
00:12:33,124 --> 00:12:34,892
I don't know.
Long message. I'm sorry.

378
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,226
That's it!

379
00:12:36,294 --> 00:12:37,594
- Ooh!
- Abed!

380
00:12:39,163 --> 00:12:40,963
Look, I'm walking out
this door right now.

381
00:12:41,031 --> 00:12:42,565
- Okay.
- Okay.

382
00:12:42,632 --> 00:12:44,099
- For real.
- Good.

383
00:12:44,167 --> 00:12:46,234
- I'm not gonna look back.
- Mm-hmm.

384
00:12:46,302 --> 00:12:48,136
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye!

385
00:12:48,204 --> 00:12:49,304
Abed!

386
00:12:49,372 --> 00:12:50,739
- Hi!
- Yes!

387
00:12:50,807 --> 00:12:51,907
Anybody need anything?

388
00:12:51,975 --> 00:12:53,742
Oh, everything.
You look handsome.

389
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:56,478
I like everything
about you now, Abed.

390
00:12:56,546 --> 00:12:58,980
I want a new hairdresser
though.

391
00:13:20,048 --> 00:13:22,617
Yeah, I got you fired.

392
00:13:22,684 --> 00:13:24,118
You deserved it.

393
00:13:24,186 --> 00:13:26,954
Maybe.
Maybe not.

394
00:13:27,022 --> 00:13:31,225
The question is:
What do they deserve?

395
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,166
Key to the kitchen.

396
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,836
There's a valve on the back
of the chicken fryer

397
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,804
That's not made anymore.

398
00:13:42,872 --> 00:13:46,241
Now, say someone were
to remove it.

399
00:13:46,309 --> 00:13:49,712
The fryer wouldn't work...

400
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:51,513
Forever.

401
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:54,916
How petty do you think I am?

402
00:13:58,654 --> 00:14:01,622
Jeff leaving the family didn't
turn out to be a problem.

403
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:04,159
Okay, I think we're set
for the quiz.

404
00:14:04,226 --> 00:14:05,593
- Yep.
- See you guys in class.

405
00:14:05,661 --> 00:14:06,895
Oh, wait.
Before you go.

406
00:14:06,963 --> 00:14:08,831
- Oh, free notebooks.
- Here.

407
00:14:08,898 --> 00:14:12,368
But the family's success started
to go to their heads.

408
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:14,003
They didn't have college ruled?

409
00:14:14,071 --> 00:14:15,171
No, sorry.

410
00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:17,240
It's okay.

411
00:14:21,712 --> 00:14:23,613
- Abed?
- Yeah?

412
00:14:23,681 --> 00:14:24,814
Can I talk to you for a minute?

413
00:14:24,882 --> 00:14:25,816
Sure.

414
00:14:25,883 --> 00:14:27,584
We have a situation.

415
00:14:27,652 --> 00:14:29,319
- Hey.
- Who is this?

416
00:14:29,387 --> 00:14:30,754
It's Travis.

417
00:14:30,822 --> 00:14:32,622
You said you wanted someone
in your entourage named Travis.

418
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:35,792
Show him your license.

419
00:14:35,859 --> 00:14:37,527
Travis is his middle name.

420
00:14:37,595 --> 00:14:38,795
I go by Travis.

421
00:14:38,863 --> 00:14:40,096
No, you go by the door.

422
00:14:40,164 --> 00:14:42,966
See you, Travis.

423
00:14:43,033 --> 00:14:46,570
Get it right next time.

424
00:14:46,638 --> 00:14:47,838
- Abed?
- Yep?

425
00:14:47,906 --> 00:14:49,907
No, no, no, no.

426
00:14:49,975 --> 00:14:55,746
My monkey hates this caviar.

427
00:14:55,814 --> 00:14:57,014
Troy, isn't that--

428
00:14:57,081 --> 00:15:00,184
They were spoiled, fat, lazy.

429
00:15:00,252 --> 00:15:01,852
I'd given them everything
and somehow

430
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,821
I'd lost their respect.

431
00:15:03,889 --> 00:15:05,690
So I did the only thing
I could think of.

432
00:15:05,757 --> 00:15:07,491
I did what I thought Jeff
would do.

433
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:10,061
I sent them a message.

434
00:15:20,672 --> 00:15:21,972
What is that?

435
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:24,241
I think it might be a backpack

436
00:15:24,308 --> 00:15:26,943
That's been mutilated.

437
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:07,349
These were the bad times.

438
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,621
- There he is.
- Jeff.

439
00:16:12,688 --> 00:16:13,922
- Jeff!
- Jeff!

440
00:16:13,989 --> 00:16:15,056
- Jeff!
- Jeff!

441
00:16:15,124 --> 00:16:16,557
Abed killed my backpack.

442
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:17,958
And I caught him
stuffing my man

443
00:16:18,026 --> 00:16:19,893
Full of chicken and Tyler Perry
has a whole series of movies

444
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,127
About why that's wrong.

445
00:16:21,195 --> 00:16:22,996
That little arab
is off his rocker.

446
00:16:23,064 --> 00:16:24,465
He released Annie's boobs.

447
00:16:24,532 --> 00:16:25,866
Annie's boobs could
be anywhere.

448
00:16:25,934 --> 00:16:27,101
Annie's boobs could be
on the side of the road.

449
00:16:27,169 --> 00:16:28,369
We got it.

450
00:16:28,437 --> 00:16:29,437
The monkey's name
is "annie's boobs."

451
00:16:29,505 --> 00:16:31,606
Look what Abed did to my hair.

452
00:16:31,674 --> 00:16:34,109
I feel terrible for all of you.

453
00:16:34,177 --> 00:16:36,245
Wait, no, I don't,
because I warned you

454
00:16:36,313 --> 00:16:38,080
About all this,
but you were so high

455
00:16:38,148 --> 00:16:39,782
On your backpacks
and hairstyles

456
00:16:39,849 --> 00:16:41,850
You accused me
of being jealous.

457
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:43,652
You were right.
But what can we do?

458
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,455
I'm sorry, you brushed over
that first part.

459
00:16:46,523 --> 00:16:49,091
Together.

460
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:51,193
You were right.

461
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:52,494
Now what you can do is go home

462
00:16:52,562 --> 00:16:54,629
And write that
on your bathroom mirror.

463
00:16:54,697 --> 00:16:56,464
Wouldn't that make it seem
like I was right?

464
00:16:56,532 --> 00:16:58,500
Yeah, because it would be
my mirror.

465
00:16:58,568 --> 00:17:00,502
It's not gonna be reversed
because you're the one who--

466
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:08,777
As for Abed, for his sake

467
00:17:08,845 --> 00:17:11,280
I guess I'll have
to take him out.

468
00:17:11,348 --> 00:17:12,482
Poor little guy.

469
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,718
Oh, good.
That's nice.

470
00:17:32,871 --> 00:17:35,372
Abed.

471
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,707
What are you doing?

472
00:17:36,774 --> 00:17:39,075
Making tater tots.

473
00:17:39,143 --> 00:17:41,344
You were right,
people got sick of chicken.

474
00:17:41,412 --> 00:17:42,379
But I was close.

475
00:17:42,447 --> 00:17:44,048
I just need a new food,
a new system.

476
00:17:44,115 --> 00:17:45,849
I'm gonna experiment
with jalapeno poppers next

477
00:17:45,917 --> 00:17:47,685
And then zucchini zircles.
I don't get it.

478
00:17:47,752 --> 00:17:49,087
It's not that complicated,
Jeff.

479
00:17:49,154 --> 00:17:50,522
They replaced the "c" in circle
with a "z" for zucchini.

480
00:17:50,589 --> 00:17:52,724
No, no, I mean,
why are you here?

481
00:17:52,792 --> 00:17:55,127
You said you were close?

482
00:17:57,597 --> 00:17:59,699
What were you close to?

483
00:18:01,468 --> 00:18:04,437
To the group?

484
00:18:04,504 --> 00:18:05,772
To people?

485
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:07,439
Please don't do
a special episode about me.

486
00:18:07,507 --> 00:18:08,874
Oh, I wouldn't dream of it.

487
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:13,277
Everyone else needs my help.

488
00:18:13,345 --> 00:18:14,779
That's what people don't get,

489
00:18:14,846 --> 00:18:18,549
Is that they need to get me.

490
00:18:18,617 --> 00:18:20,584
I just need to be able to
connect to people like you can,

491
00:18:20,651 --> 00:18:22,119
And then I can
make everyone happy

492
00:18:22,186 --> 00:18:25,189
Like you do.

493
00:18:27,326 --> 00:18:28,888
Do you know why I'm here?

494
00:18:28,956 --> 00:18:30,688
You got caught
with a fake bachelor's degree.

495
00:18:30,755 --> 00:18:32,022
By the way,
they started using that

496
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:33,356
As a seasonal arc on
law & order.

497
00:18:33,424 --> 00:18:35,191
Total rip off.

498
00:18:35,259 --> 00:18:38,227
I'm here to dismantle
the fryer,

499
00:18:38,295 --> 00:18:42,365
To cut your power off
at its source.

500
00:18:42,432 --> 00:18:43,867
Don't you see what happened?

501
00:18:43,934 --> 00:18:45,201
I manipulated the group

502
00:18:45,269 --> 00:18:46,635
Into getting you
the fry cook job

503
00:18:46,703 --> 00:18:49,071
So I could have some chicken.

504
00:18:49,139 --> 00:18:52,241
And you turned it all into
a way to make everyone like you.

505
00:18:52,309 --> 00:18:53,443
Mm-hmm.

506
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,812
Made me ashamed of myself.

507
00:18:55,879 --> 00:18:57,280
Made me jealous.

508
00:18:57,348 --> 00:18:58,948
Maybe this is
a special episode.

509
00:18:59,016 --> 00:19:00,549
It's pretty alarming behavior,
Jeff.

510
00:19:00,617 --> 00:19:01,883
Yeah.

511
00:19:01,951 --> 00:19:03,318
You know, there's specialists
you could talk to.

512
00:19:03,386 --> 00:19:04,786
Yeah, maybe I should do that.

513
00:19:04,854 --> 00:19:05,921
Mm-hmm.

514
00:19:05,988 --> 00:19:07,289
- In the meantime...
- Mm-hmm?

515
00:19:07,356 --> 00:19:08,456
Let's make a deal.

516
00:19:08,524 --> 00:19:10,858
I'll help you
connect with people,

517
00:19:10,925 --> 00:19:12,926
And you help me
do a better job with them.

518
00:19:12,994 --> 00:19:14,661
Like knight rider.

519
00:19:14,729 --> 00:19:16,262
Exactly.
Like knight rider.

520
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:17,530
Deal.

521
00:19:17,598 --> 00:19:18,698
I'll put on a leather jacket

522
00:19:18,765 --> 00:19:19,999
And make out
with an aerobics instructor.

523
00:19:20,067 --> 00:19:21,500
You pull around front
and comedically

524
00:19:21,568 --> 00:19:23,769
Startle passersby
with your ability to talk.

525
00:19:23,837 --> 00:19:25,271
Maybe we should just stay here

526
00:19:25,338 --> 00:19:26,939
And have a plate
of chicken fingers.

527
00:19:27,007 --> 00:19:28,708
Cool.

528
00:19:28,776 --> 00:19:30,343
Can we eat them
while sitting on a table

529
00:19:30,411 --> 00:19:31,444
Like in sixteen candles?

530
00:19:31,512 --> 00:19:32,945
Pick one reference, Abed.

531
00:19:33,013 --> 00:19:34,681
Sixteen candles.

532
00:19:34,748 --> 00:19:37,451
And just like that,
the mafia movie was over.

533
00:19:37,518 --> 00:19:39,052
I quit the fry cook job,

534
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,154
Somewhat for the sake
of the family,

535
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:43,890
But mostly for the sake
of Jeff's ego.

536
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:45,324
Poor guy.

537
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:46,992
Things went back to normal.

538
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,828
Now everyone's back to being
a bunch of regular schnooks,

539
00:19:49,896 --> 00:19:52,230
And I'm back to being a weirdo,

540
00:19:52,298 --> 00:19:54,833
Back to watching
from the outside...

541
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,334
For now.

542
00:19:56,402 --> 00:19:57,936
There's still
not enough chicken fingers.

543
00:19:58,003 --> 00:20:00,605
- No way.
- What?

544
00:20:00,673 --> 00:20:02,140
'cause as soon
as our family moved out,

545
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:04,509
A new syndicate moved in
to take its place.

546
00:20:04,577 --> 00:20:07,212
But you know what they'll
never make a replacement for?

547
00:20:08,982 --> 00:20:11,650
Friends.

548
00:20:11,718 --> 00:20:14,187
Okay, thank you.
That's great, Abed.

549
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:16,656
But could you just
answer the question?

550
00:20:16,724 --> 00:20:18,159
What was it?

551
00:20:18,226 --> 00:20:19,660
Do you know
who might have stolen

552
00:20:19,728 --> 00:20:21,328
A box of hairnets
from the kitchen?

553
00:20:21,396 --> 00:20:22,863
Someone with hair.

554
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:25,599
I'm gonna write that down.

555
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:34,198
