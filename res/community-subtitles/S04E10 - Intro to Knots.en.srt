1
00:00:03,205 --> 00:00:04,988
It's open!

2
00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:09,576
Look at us. Our group's
first grown-up Christmas party.

3
00:00:09,592 --> 00:00:11,592
Thanks for hosting.
I hope you don't mind.

4
00:00:11,603 --> 00:00:13,108
I brought a few things
just to make the place

5
00:00:13,121 --> 00:00:15,887
look a little less short-term
corporate housing.

6
00:00:15,917 --> 00:00:18,452
Oh, well,
mi casa es su art project.

7
00:00:18,542 --> 00:00:19,792
Cool.

8
00:00:20,161 --> 00:00:23,330
Figured just a little
something there,

9
00:00:23,341 --> 00:00:25,847
a little zhuzh right there.

10
00:00:25,902 --> 00:00:28,397
Just a few things
to add a little Annie.

11
00:00:28,423 --> 00:00:29,798
Annie, do we have to have
another talk

12
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,902
about you wanting
to play house with me?

13
00:00:31,937 --> 00:00:35,738
Sha.
Sha-na-not.

14
00:00:35,813 --> 00:00:38,722
I'm just decorating
for a party.

15
00:00:38,777 --> 00:00:41,456
Oh, I saw these curtains,
and I couldn't resist.

16
00:00:41,468 --> 00:00:42,740
Let's just live with them
for a night.

17
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:45,773
We can totally return them.
Oh, let's totally return them.

18
00:00:45,792 --> 00:00:48,878
Jeff.
Live with them for one night.

19
00:00:48,936 --> 00:00:52,164
Actually, these will also work
for Valentine's Day,

20
00:00:52,189 --> 00:00:54,351
Presidents Day,
whenever people get to see it.

21
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:57,979
Annie, what is this?

22
00:00:58,085 --> 00:00:59,148
Oh.

23
00:00:59,204 --> 00:01:00,927
I know we said no gifts,

24
00:01:00,948 --> 00:01:03,149
but I couldn't resist.

25
00:01:03,249 --> 00:01:06,135
You realize you've just put your
friends in a very awkward position.

26
00:01:06,155 --> 00:01:08,492
A gift creates obligation.

27
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:09,909
I don't see it that way.

28
00:01:09,921 --> 00:01:12,546
Well, I do, and I think the
others will too.

29
00:01:12,932 --> 00:01:14,078
Merry Christmas.

30
00:01:14,102 --> 00:01:16,170
I know we said no gifts,
but I couldn't resist.

31
00:01:16,206 --> 00:01:18,375
Oh, who couldn't have seen
that coming?

32
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,224
Oh, Annie, I love
what you did with the place.

33
00:01:20,248 --> 00:01:22,438
It's a work in progress.

34
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:25,234
Good tidings,
fellow Christmas celebrators.

35
00:01:25,266 --> 00:01:26,522
And to all a good wassailing.

36
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,103
I know we said no gifts,
but we couldn't resist.

37
00:01:29,128 --> 00:01:32,841
There's a real problem
with resistance in this group.

38
00:01:33,174 --> 00:01:36,774
Hi. Thank you all so much for
inviting me to my first Christmas.

39
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,817
Oh, Annie explained to me that
"no gifts" means "bring gifts."

40
00:01:40,848 --> 00:01:42,897
I'm getting it.
No means yes.

41
00:01:45,412 --> 00:01:47,911
So this is Christmas.
Just this.

42
00:01:47,932 --> 00:01:49,626
I was hoping we could do
a <i>Die Hard</i> in a restaurant.

43
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,864
There's a place
called Nakatomi Sushi.

44
00:01:50,901 --> 00:01:52,985
I hear the Hans Grouper
is to die for.

45
00:01:53,027 --> 00:01:55,415
Come on, people, it's all spelled out in
your evites. I know you opened them.

46
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:56,771
Oh, I brought gifts.

47
00:01:56,796 --> 00:01:58,356
Does Annie live here now?

48
00:01:58,932 --> 00:02:00,769
Okay.

49
00:02:00,882 --> 00:02:02,724
Now that we're all here...

50
00:02:02,787 --> 00:02:04,481
Oh, wait.
Where's Pierce?

51
00:02:04,513 --> 00:02:06,918
Oh, sensitivity training
with Gilbert.

52
00:02:06,983 --> 00:02:09,284
Apparently watching <i>Invictus</i>
didn't do the trick.

53
00:02:09,355 --> 00:02:10,432
Oh. Okay.

54
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:12,539
Well, now that we are all here,

55
00:02:12,587 --> 00:02:15,560
I have some good news
and some bad news.

56
00:02:15,578 --> 00:02:17,478
Great.
Black licorice?

57
00:02:17,503 --> 00:02:19,177
I have to start
with the bad news.

58
00:02:19,243 --> 00:02:21,272
It's about our history paper.

59
00:02:21,304 --> 00:02:23,978
I heard through back channels
we got a failing grade.

60
00:02:24,014 --> 00:02:25,731
- What?
- Kendra told me.

61
00:02:25,758 --> 00:02:27,706
She does assistant work
for Professor cornwallis.

62
00:02:27,742 --> 00:02:29,555
I'll bet she does.

63
00:02:29,593 --> 00:02:31,493
We failed?
This is terrible.

64
00:02:31,513 --> 00:02:33,677
I need that paper to graduate.

65
00:02:33,718 --> 00:02:34,873
Who screwed up their section?

66
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:36,621
- Jeff, it doesn't matter.
- No, it matters to me.

67
00:02:36,661 --> 00:02:39,135
I want to know who cost me
my early graduation.

68
00:02:39,153 --> 00:02:41,031
- I didn't do anything wrong.
- I worked really hard.

69
00:02:41,064 --> 00:02:43,485
Guys, there's no need
to point fingers,

70
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,360
because I haven't told you
the good news.

71
00:02:45,372 --> 00:02:47,163
I invited the Professor
to our party tonight.

72
00:02:47,194 --> 00:02:48,961
- Annie!
- What? How is that better?

73
00:02:48,986 --> 00:02:51,240
No, no, Annie's right.
This could work.

74
00:02:51,259 --> 00:02:53,216
I mean, the grade isn't etched
in stone.

75
00:02:53,246 --> 00:02:56,176
I mean, these British guys like
to socialize with their students.

76
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:58,348
We just need to show him
a good time,

77
00:02:58,373 --> 00:03:01,784
laugh at his jokes, love whatever he
loves, and by the end of the night

78
00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:04,414
I bet you we can get that grade
back up to a "C".

79
00:03:04,445 --> 00:03:05,711
Who knows?
Maybe even an "A".

80
00:03:05,742 --> 00:03:06,961
Or something realistic.

81
00:03:06,996 --> 00:03:08,850
And just like that
our pleasant holiday party

82
00:03:08,862 --> 00:03:10,871
turned into a tense,
high-stakes secret mission.

83
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:13,187
No costumes.
No funny voices.

84
00:03:13,237 --> 00:03:14,872
- Oh.
- Okay.

85
00:03:14,935 --> 00:03:16,598
But, for the purpose
of story symmetry,

86
00:03:16,628 --> 00:03:18,891
I suggest we wait here silently
until the Professor arrives.

87
00:03:18,925 --> 00:03:20,890
It's the only real plot point
we need next.

88
00:03:25,954 --> 00:03:27,354
Oh, what...

99
00:03:56,223 --> 00:03:58,159
Hi!

100
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,670
I'm sorry.
I can't stay long.

101
00:03:59,692 --> 00:04:01,443
I've got my daughter in town.

102
00:04:01,461 --> 00:04:03,281
Didn't want to appear rude.

103
00:04:03,544 --> 00:04:06,437
Was I expected to bring a gift?

104
00:04:06,469 --> 00:04:09,609
No.
Nor was anyone else.

105
00:04:09,633 --> 00:04:11,442
Can I show you around,
starting with the bar?

106
00:04:11,473 --> 00:04:13,834
A lovely place.
Very feminine.

107
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:17,464
Did you hear him use
"feminine" as an insult?

108
00:04:17,502 --> 00:04:19,836
Typical phallo-centric
worldview.

109
00:04:19,874 --> 00:04:23,764
I bet he gave us a failing grade
because he could tell my section

110
00:04:23,783 --> 00:04:25,995
was written
by a strong, independent...

111
00:04:26,019 --> 00:04:27,959
Would you excuse me?
I've just seen an old friend.

112
00:04:27,978 --> 00:04:30,372
Hurry back soon.

113
00:04:31,117 --> 00:04:34,237
Hey, Abed,
got you an early Christmas gift.

114
00:04:34,298 --> 00:04:36,899
I know you were bummed about not
doing <i>Die Hard</i> in a restaurant.

115
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:39,927
And your recent divorce.

116
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:42,487
Yippee-ki-yay, Father Christmas.

117
00:04:42,504 --> 00:04:45,399
I tried to get you "taking off shoes,"
but I didn't know how to wrap it.

118
00:04:45,531 --> 00:04:47,066
John McClane's tank top?

119
00:04:47,149 --> 00:04:49,750
You're getting really good
at Christmas, Troy.

120
00:04:49,812 --> 00:04:52,170
- Ooh, things I've never seen before.
- It's Macallan Eighteen.

121
00:04:52,196 --> 00:04:54,461
I like to serve it neat
if that's okay with you?

122
00:04:54,475 --> 00:04:55,668
What, in America?

123
00:04:55,701 --> 00:04:58,064
Don't you mix it
with cherry pop or

124
00:04:58,134 --> 00:04:59,995
Monterey Jack cheese?

125
00:05:00,016 --> 00:05:02,404
Professor,
these are melon slices with ham.

126
00:05:02,423 --> 00:05:04,043
And asparagus
wrapped in salmon.

127
00:05:04,055 --> 00:05:07,048
I see somebody's
been attempting tapas.

128
00:05:07,077 --> 00:05:08,333
Oh, that would be me.

129
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:11,288
I think cuisine is like
a window into history.

130
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:12,620
I believe it was the hun...

131
00:05:12,644 --> 00:05:15,225
Actually, you know,
I was talking to the ladies.

132
00:05:15,244 --> 00:05:16,627
Oh.

133
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:19,110
Well, I'll let... I'll leave
you three be, all right?

134
00:05:19,257 --> 00:05:20,757
Britta.

135
00:05:21,418 --> 00:05:23,874
Look, the Professor
seems to be responding

136
00:05:23,893 --> 00:05:25,300
to things that I don't have,

137
00:05:25,324 --> 00:05:27,221
so you gotta get in there
and jiggle something.

138
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,141
He hates me.

139
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,165
He called me Broken
Barbie all year.

140
00:05:30,182 --> 00:05:33,882
Well, we're all gonna have to work it
if we're gonna get that grade changed.

141
00:05:34,326 --> 00:05:36,310
Be honest.
Your section sucked, right?

142
00:05:36,338 --> 00:05:39,524
No way. I read an entire book
on the Peloponnesian War.

143
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:41,437
Wow.
You pronounced it right.

144
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:44,463
Then someone else had to tank
it for us to get that "F".

145
00:05:44,475 --> 00:05:46,870
Someone else?

146
00:05:47,223 --> 00:05:49,401
- Can you keep a secret?
- Yeah.

147
00:05:49,526 --> 00:05:51,939
- I blew my section off.
- What?

148
00:05:51,957 --> 00:05:55,038
Well, there was a secret Tom Waits
show in town, so I did the math.

149
00:05:55,057 --> 00:05:57,036
There's seven sections
to the paper.

150
00:05:57,067 --> 00:06:00,514
Annie gets an "A", Pierce buys
his from Neil, so that's solid.

151
00:06:00,545 --> 00:06:02,033
And then you guys get
"B"s and "C"s,

152
00:06:02,045 --> 00:06:04,079
so, I figured if my
section gets an "F",

153
00:06:04,103 --> 00:06:06,307
the worst we could end up
with is a "C-minus."

154
00:06:06,358 --> 00:06:07,968
So you just left
your section blank?

155
00:06:07,987 --> 00:06:09,180
No, of course not.

156
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,608
I copied and pasted the lyrics
to <i>War, What Is It Good For?</i>

157
00:06:11,627 --> 00:06:13,478
- Good God.
- Shh.

158
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,463
Your friends
were counting on you.

159
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:16,795
Well, that's their fault.

160
00:06:16,826 --> 00:06:21,154
I have carefully cultivated a persona
that screams, "you're on your own."

161
00:06:21,778 --> 00:06:23,042
That's my judgey face.

162
00:06:23,065 --> 00:06:24,574
Noted.
I'll make it right.

163
00:06:24,586 --> 00:06:26,355
I'm going back in.

164
00:06:28,516 --> 00:06:30,790
- How's it going?
- Well, he asked me to get

165
00:06:30,809 --> 00:06:32,853
my fit bum to the kitchen
for a refill,

166
00:06:32,862 --> 00:06:33,961
so that's good, right?

167
00:06:33,981 --> 00:06:35,449
Kevin's showing him
a card trick.

168
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:36,475
What?

169
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:38,408
Oh, God.

170
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:39,507
Is this a card?

171
00:06:39,526 --> 00:06:41,566
No, it isn't.
Queen of Hearts.

172
00:06:41,598 --> 00:06:42,879
No, I'm asking, is this a card?

173
00:06:42,898 --> 00:06:45,254
Hey, Kevin, did you know
that we have bubble wrap?

174
00:06:45,334 --> 00:06:47,865
- What?
- Poppy poppy paper.

175
00:06:48,189 --> 00:06:50,608
I so enjoy that.
Do you mind if I pop some?

176
00:06:50,627 --> 00:06:51,971
Oh, go crazy.

177
00:06:52,091 --> 00:06:53,262
Changnesia.

178
00:06:53,286 --> 00:06:55,641
I mean,
why do you indulge that idiot?

179
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,637
Oh, I, too, was skeptical
at first,

180
00:06:57,654 --> 00:06:59,480
but now I actually have
some sympathy.

181
00:06:59,512 --> 00:07:00,887
I believe
it was Tacitus who said...

182
00:07:00,922 --> 00:07:03,630
You know, Mr. Winger,
your pathetic attempts

183
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,867
to suck up to me
are a wee bit transparent.

184
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:07,944
I mean, I can only surmise
that it's something to do

185
00:07:07,968 --> 00:07:10,651
with the "C-minus" I gave you
for that final paper.

186
00:07:11,024 --> 00:07:12,072
"C-minus"?

187
00:07:12,096 --> 00:07:13,959
Oh, thank you.
Is this the...

188
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,488
If you'll excuse us.

189
00:07:15,512 --> 00:07:17,605
Annie, he's giving us
a "C-minus."

190
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:20,002
- Right.
- A "C-minus" is not a failing grade.

191
00:07:20,016 --> 00:07:21,276
To me, it is.

192
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,786
I'm on a Valedictorian track,

193
00:07:22,798 --> 00:07:25,788
and a "C-minus" means I fail
to get Valedictorian.

194
00:07:25,832 --> 00:07:27,613
You ruined our Christmas dinner

195
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:30,584
so you could be crowned the smartest
person at the dumbest school?

196
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,095
Look, the only reason I agreed

197
00:07:32,112 --> 00:07:33,980
to kiss
that pompous anglo's ass

198
00:07:34,002 --> 00:07:35,889
was because I thought
we were getting an "F".

199
00:07:35,901 --> 00:07:37,413
Good news, Mr. Winger.

200
00:07:37,437 --> 00:07:39,723
You may remove your lips
from my buttocks,

201
00:07:39,742 --> 00:07:43,004
because you have in fact succeeded
in changing your grade.

202
00:07:43,081 --> 00:07:45,062
- It's now an "F".
- What?

203
00:07:45,103 --> 00:07:46,564
You're "F" -ing us?

204
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:49,555
Professor, if you could
just give us a minute,

205
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:51,502
this has been
a terrible misunderstanding,

206
00:07:51,528 --> 00:07:55,130
and I'm sure we can get
this whole thing sorted out.

207
00:07:55,744 --> 00:07:57,696
Bedroom.
Now.

208
00:07:59,764 --> 00:08:01,105
Jeff just got us an "F".

209
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:03,562
- I thought we had an "F".
- No, we were lied to.

210
00:08:03,586 --> 00:08:04,949
This isn't fun.
That guy's creepy.

211
00:08:04,966 --> 00:08:07,603
Yeah, if there's a human version
of Scrooge McDuck, this guy is it.

212
00:08:07,627 --> 00:08:09,606
This wouldn't have happened
if Jeff hadn't taunted him.

213
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,923
No, it wouldn't have happened
if you hadn't decided

214
00:08:11,935 --> 00:08:13,511
a "C-minus" isn't good enough.

215
00:08:13,536 --> 00:08:14,980
When are you gonna grow up
and realize

216
00:08:14,997 --> 00:08:17,314
that grades don't matter
outside of school?

217
00:08:17,341 --> 00:08:20,211
That's a lie they tell dumb people when
they're fitting them for work boots.

218
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,742
All we needed
was a passing grade,

219
00:08:21,766 --> 00:08:25,110
and we had it until you
dragged us into this mess.

220
00:08:26,564 --> 00:08:28,168
- Judgey face.
- All right.

221
00:08:28,173 --> 00:08:29,720
I will talk to him, man to man,

222
00:08:29,726 --> 00:08:31,213
and try to get
our "C-minus" back.

223
00:08:31,226 --> 00:08:31,853
Ah!

224
00:08:31,877 --> 00:08:33,807
Annie, it's the best
we can do right now.

225
00:08:33,826 --> 00:08:35,836
- Let me handle this.
- Let go of me,

226
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,995
you big, hairy nutter!

227
00:08:39,135 --> 00:08:40,956
I'm proving my worth
to you guys.

228
00:08:41,014 --> 00:08:43,731
Do you want me to kill him?

229
00:08:48,818 --> 00:08:51,540
- Kevin bad!
- I have Changnesia.

230
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:52,440
I'm not a dog.

231
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:54,929
Professor, we're so sorry.

232
00:08:54,948 --> 00:08:56,932
Obviously,
Kevin made a mistake.

233
00:08:56,956 --> 00:08:58,345
Or did he?

234
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,823
Why are you
"or did he" -ing him?

235
00:08:59,841 --> 00:09:02,609
I'm just saying the Professor
can't get any more tied up,

236
00:09:02,615 --> 00:09:04,649
and we can't get any less
than an "F",

237
00:09:04,673 --> 00:09:07,124
so let's just take a beat
and think this through.

238
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:09,115
Okay, this is way better
than <i>Die Hard</i> in a restaurant.

239
00:09:09,134 --> 00:09:12,679
So what exactly
is your plan here, Mr. Winger?

240
00:09:12,739 --> 00:09:14,989
I mean, I'm certainly
not gonna change your grade,

241
00:09:15,032 --> 00:09:17,749
and it'll take several days
to starve me

242
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:20,855
as I really loaded up
on that dreadful tapas.

243
00:09:20,866 --> 00:09:23,328
Oh, but you already
have changed it, Professor.

244
00:09:23,341 --> 00:09:25,172
You just dropped it to an "F",

245
00:09:25,201 --> 00:09:28,661
thereby proving the work on the page
is not the only factor you consider.

246
00:09:28,731 --> 00:09:30,990
And now, thanks to Kevin's
complete misreading

247
00:09:31,014 --> 00:09:34,086
of the situation, we have
our moment of maximum leverage,

248
00:09:34,105 --> 00:09:36,081
so let's just talk
about this "F".

249
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:39,682
Maybe it can come up
to a "C-minus," or, who knows,

250
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,245
perhaps an "A".

251
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,102
This is actually a felony.

252
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:45,440
I mean, I will call the police,

253
00:09:45,453 --> 00:09:47,267
and you will all go to jail.

254
00:09:47,298 --> 00:09:49,165
Let me explain to you
why you won't do that.

255
00:09:49,201 --> 00:09:50,413
First, he's tied up.

256
00:09:50,437 --> 00:09:52,643
First, you're tied up,
and second,

257
00:09:52,669 --> 00:09:55,230
who can really be sure
what happened in this apartment?

258
00:09:55,267 --> 00:09:56,610
Maybe you attacked one of us.

259
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:59,649
Oh, really?
Where are the signs of struggle?

260
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,115
- Oh.
- You were full of scotch

261
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,595
when things took a dark turn.

262
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:07,663
We'd all heard about your troubles
with co-eds back at Oxford,

263
00:10:07,682 --> 00:10:11,158
but it was becoming
all too real.

264
00:10:11,245 --> 00:10:13,509
As you lumbered around the room,
we had to assume

265
00:10:13,533 --> 00:10:15,856
you were coming after me
or Britta.

266
00:10:15,895 --> 00:10:17,062
Ah-ah-ahem!

267
00:10:17,082 --> 00:10:18,631
Or Shirley,

268
00:10:18,649 --> 00:10:22,607
who I didn't mention earlier, because
she intimidates you sexually.

269
00:10:22,658 --> 00:10:25,498
- Thank you.
- Point being,

270
00:10:25,522 --> 00:10:28,963
let's just take the idea of the police
off the table, shall we, Professor?

271
00:10:28,988 --> 00:10:33,477
Fine. You think you can hold this group
together without anyone cracking?

272
00:10:33,503 --> 00:10:34,929
Oh, we're solid.

273
00:10:34,961 --> 00:10:38,644
Empires are always destroyed
from within.

274
00:10:38,687 --> 00:10:43,409
And I can prove it to you from the
comparative comfort of this tacky chair.

275
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,557
I will give an "A" right now

276
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,975
to the first person
that unties me.

277
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:49,187
The rest of you will fail.

278
00:10:52,433 --> 00:10:53,567
Stay where you are.

279
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:55,767
This is amazing and
possibly all in real time.

280
00:10:55,786 --> 00:10:58,384
Everybody, stop it.
No one listen to him.

281
00:10:58,469 --> 00:11:00,322
The Professor's job
is to make us turn

282
00:11:00,341 --> 00:11:02,690
on one another.
We hold all the cards

283
00:11:02,726 --> 00:11:04,537
as long as we stay united.

284
00:11:04,567 --> 00:11:06,111
And, Kevin, you're one of us.

285
00:11:06,145 --> 00:11:08,379
- Thank you.
- All right.

286
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:11,756
Who will be the betrayer...

287
00:11:11,832 --> 00:11:14,501
the type-a lolita,

288
00:11:14,615 --> 00:11:17,191
the put-upon housewife...
- Is that me?

289
00:11:17,229 --> 00:11:20,865
Or how about you,
the odd, emotionless Muslim?

290
00:11:20,933 --> 00:11:23,080
I mean, come on,
you don't deserve an "F".

291
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:25,230
And you know that,
because of your impairment,

292
00:11:25,243 --> 00:11:27,434
they'll forgive you anyway.

293
00:11:27,461 --> 00:11:29,610
All true, but I'm probably
not your best target.

294
00:11:29,621 --> 00:11:31,240
If you don't mind,
I'd like to get some popcorn.

295
00:11:31,264 --> 00:11:32,990
Typically, it takes a while
for villains to ramp up.

296
00:11:33,003 --> 00:11:34,871
Promise not to monologue
till I get back?

297
00:11:34,909 --> 00:11:36,553
Give it up, Professor.
You got nothing.

298
00:11:36,572 --> 00:11:38,946
Oh, I've got plenty.

299
00:11:38,966 --> 00:11:40,756
Why don't we just let him go
and be done with this?

300
00:11:40,782 --> 00:11:42,451
It's Christmas.
We have gifts to unwrap.

301
00:11:42,471 --> 00:11:45,001
Don't you see? We can't now
or someone will get the "A".

302
00:11:45,052 --> 00:11:46,354
No one wants to screw the group.

303
00:11:46,374 --> 00:11:47,744
Oh, you see that, Professor?

304
00:11:47,763 --> 00:11:50,962
Your offer actually made it
harder for you to get untied,

305
00:11:50,995 --> 00:11:52,726
because no one wants
to be the betrayer.

306
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:55,849
Beware the Ides of March,
Mr. Winger.

307
00:11:56,024 --> 00:11:58,697
Everyone wants to be
the betrayer.

308
00:11:58,721 --> 00:12:00,827
What the hell is your game?

309
00:12:00,866 --> 00:12:03,652
I'm trying
to teach you history.

310
00:12:03,903 --> 00:12:07,298
Your failure will be the same
as any self-obsessed nation.

311
00:12:07,388 --> 00:12:09,688
You only care about each other
when you're winning.

312
00:12:09,745 --> 00:12:13,091
The Romans loved Rome when it
was raping half the world,

313
00:12:13,104 --> 00:12:15,798
but when Hannibal
came charging over the Alps,

314
00:12:15,816 --> 00:12:17,436
the Romans turned on themselves

315
00:12:17,461 --> 00:12:20,831
as quickly as you can say,
"e pluribus unum."

316
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:23,131
I'm pretty sure it's "anus."

317
00:12:23,144 --> 00:12:26,485
Usually, the cracks are hidden
within the alliances.

318
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:27,832
So let's see.

319
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:29,053
In any group of seven,

320
00:12:29,085 --> 00:12:32,397
there's bound to be
some romantic entanglements.

321
00:12:32,428 --> 00:12:35,100
See, I've noticed
that the damaged blonde

322
00:12:35,113 --> 00:12:37,398
is dating
the childish black one,

323
00:12:37,721 --> 00:12:40,173
I wonder, does anyone
take issue with that pairing?

324
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:43,431
You're fishing, Professor. No one has
anything against Britta and Troy dating.

325
00:12:43,456 --> 00:12:47,095
And that's coming from Jeff,
and we used to date, so...

326
00:12:47,123 --> 00:12:48,976
Britta, information is ammo.

327
00:12:48,995 --> 00:12:50,543
And what we did was not dating.

328
00:12:50,567 --> 00:12:52,697
- Uh.
- Ah. A little friction.

329
00:12:52,721 --> 00:12:54,456
That usually indicates heat.

330
00:12:54,475 --> 00:12:56,379
Heat?
There's no heat.

331
00:12:56,551 --> 00:12:59,235
If there was heat, I'd be nervous, and,
if I was nervous, I'd be rambling,

332
00:12:59,254 --> 00:13:01,187
and I'm definitely not rambling,
so there's no heat.

333
00:13:01,211 --> 00:13:04,017
Ah, well, I think
we found our triangle.

334
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:06,556
Thank you
and welcome to the party, Troy.

335
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:09,248
- He knows my name.
- Guys, keep it together.

336
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,099
I missed something great,
didn't I?

337
00:13:21,123 --> 00:13:24,282
Enough. It's time to stop
arsing about and get serious.

338
00:13:24,325 --> 00:13:26,823
So let's hear it
from the one person

339
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,818
who needs that "A" the most

340
00:13:28,865 --> 00:13:32,001
and can't possibly abide
by an "F",

341
00:13:32,028 --> 00:13:36,831
the one person on pace
to become class Valedictorian.

342
00:13:37,563 --> 00:13:39,181
I would never turn
against the group.

343
00:13:39,192 --> 00:13:41,116
I'm not talking
about you, Miss Edison.

344
00:13:41,142 --> 00:13:43,278
What?
Abed?

345
00:13:43,302 --> 00:13:45,346
Jeff?
Is it me?

346
00:13:45,365 --> 00:13:46,940
Oh, my God, Britta?

347
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,253
First of all, it's me, and, second
of all, you put Britta ahead of me?

348
00:13:50,264 --> 00:13:51,490
None taken.

349
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:53,120
Oh, my God, Shirley.

350
00:13:53,152 --> 00:13:55,971
- Why didn't you ever tell me about it?
- I didn't think it was a competition.

351
00:13:55,982 --> 00:13:58,404
Oh, of course
you'd play it that way

352
00:13:58,436 --> 00:13:59,499
so I wouldn't be expecting...

353
00:13:59,524 --> 00:14:02,193
A church-going mother of three
to be smart, huh?

354
00:14:02,212 --> 00:14:06,075
So, Miss Edison,
it's decision time, isn't it?

355
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:07,721
Annie, don't listen to him.

356
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:10,649
You know you can't make
Valedictorian with an "F",

357
00:14:10,668 --> 00:14:14,120
and you can eliminate your
competition in one easy step.

358
00:14:14,134 --> 00:14:16,885
What else do you have
to lose, my dear?

359
00:14:17,412 --> 00:14:20,011
I mean, these people,
they're not here to support you.

360
00:14:20,042 --> 00:14:23,677
I mean, they already hate you
for this disaster of a party.

361
00:14:23,698 --> 00:14:25,297
Not this guy.

362
00:14:25,412 --> 00:14:26,842
No.

363
00:14:26,868 --> 00:14:27,885
I can't.

364
00:14:27,911 --> 00:14:30,346
Give it up, Professor.
You've fired all your bullets.

365
00:14:30,376 --> 00:14:33,899
No, I've got
one more bullet left,

366
00:14:33,963 --> 00:14:36,120
and it's a doozy.

367
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:38,846
Mr. Winger, would you like
to tell your friends

368
00:14:38,865 --> 00:14:42,861
why they did so poorly on
this paper, or shall I?

369
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,129
- Jeff?
- Jeff?

370
00:14:44,154 --> 00:14:45,567
Jeffrey.

371
00:14:47,538 --> 00:14:48,995
I tanked my section.

372
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:51,165
I knew you guys
would all work hard, so

373
00:14:51,227 --> 00:14:52,529
I just coasted.

374
00:14:52,548 --> 00:14:53,755
- Tom Waits was...
- Ah!

375
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:55,924
- Ow.
- You cost me Valedictorian.

376
00:14:55,951 --> 00:14:58,235
He cost me Valedictorian.
That was my punch.

377
00:15:02,871 --> 00:15:04,605
Tom waits!

378
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,630
Oh, my God.

379
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:11,205
Jeff, do you have
any milk duds?

380
00:15:17,134 --> 00:15:19,028
Jeffrey, I know
you're in there.

381
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:21,070
I can smell you.

382
00:15:21,312 --> 00:15:23,789
- Did I have the game on too loud?
- Is everything okay?

383
00:15:23,832 --> 00:15:25,081
I was just spending an evening

384
00:15:25,113 --> 00:15:27,673
with my two irresistible lady
friends, Rizzoli and Isles,

385
00:15:27,698 --> 00:15:29,551
when I heard...
wait a minute.

386
00:15:29,576 --> 00:15:30,743
What the hell
is going on in here?

387
00:15:30,773 --> 00:15:33,169
- No, don't!
- I can explain.

388
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,659
No explanation necessary.

389
00:15:35,697 --> 00:15:38,615
Next time you decide to have
a party without me, Jeffrey,

390
00:15:38,647 --> 00:15:42,115
at least have the decency
to do it when I'm in spin class.

391
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:47,164
I'm a blast at
holiday-themed parties.

392
00:15:47,183 --> 00:15:50,187
- Where the hell is he?
- Professor? Did he leave?

393
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,118
Why in God's name
would I leave?

394
00:15:53,424 --> 00:15:54,687
This is just getting
interesting.

395
00:15:54,712 --> 00:15:57,769
Now, one of you untied me.

396
00:15:57,799 --> 00:15:59,959
I wonder who it was.

397
00:15:59,984 --> 00:16:02,475
Who is the Benedict Arnold,

398
00:16:02,539 --> 00:16:04,340
the true hero of this story?

399
00:16:04,378 --> 00:16:07,701
Oh, no, what's gonna happen when
we find out who betrayed us?

400
00:16:07,913 --> 00:16:09,693
I wonder why you're so scared.

401
00:16:09,946 --> 00:16:10,918
It wasn't me.

402
00:16:10,934 --> 00:16:12,769
Can we just say
a ghost did it again?

403
00:16:12,794 --> 00:16:15,061
We're gonna find out who
did it when we get our grade.

404
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,543
No, we'll have to find out now.

405
00:16:17,655 --> 00:16:19,661
Otherwise,
the lesson isn't complete.

406
00:16:19,684 --> 00:16:22,174
But the lesson
is complete, Professor.

407
00:16:22,211 --> 00:16:23,352
You know what you taught us
tonight?

408
00:16:23,371 --> 00:16:26,105
That, yes, empires fall, but

409
00:16:26,296 --> 00:16:27,259
we're no empire.

410
00:16:27,288 --> 00:16:29,739
We're just a bunch
of flawed, selfish people.

411
00:16:29,836 --> 00:16:31,268
And that's not our weakness.

412
00:16:31,475 --> 00:16:32,437
It's our strength.

413
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,999
The one thing
that we can count on

414
00:16:34,024 --> 00:16:36,280
at any given moment
is that the six of us

415
00:16:36,312 --> 00:16:38,649
are paying for a mistake
made by one of us.

416
00:16:38,661 --> 00:16:42,456
And that means, at any given moment,
one of us is screwing up so badly,

417
00:16:42,474 --> 00:16:45,730
that he or she is gonna forgive
whoever screws up next.

418
00:16:45,945 --> 00:16:49,037
Now I'm gonna do something
that Octavian never would...

419
00:16:49,048 --> 00:16:50,577
yeah, I read the book.

420
00:16:50,601 --> 00:16:53,043
I'm gonna say that
whoever untied the Professor...

421
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,586
I don't give a crap.

422
00:16:54,668 --> 00:16:55,934
Because whoever it was,

423
00:16:55,952 --> 00:17:00,269
I know it was
some flawed, selfish, weak,

424
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:02,479
hopeless soul like me.

425
00:17:06,084 --> 00:17:08,569
Exactly what the betrayer
would say.

426
00:17:08,788 --> 00:17:11,059
Fine, dick, if it was me,

427
00:17:11,134 --> 00:17:13,238
I'm gonna lose my "A"
by tying you up again.

428
00:17:13,259 --> 00:17:14,205
Ow!

429
00:17:16,226 --> 00:17:18,294
Get over here.

430
00:17:18,382 --> 00:17:20,115
That's hurting.
That's hurting.

431
00:17:21,615 --> 00:17:24,519
Now, if you'll excuse us,
we have some gifts to open.

432
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,792
Ooh, mine first, mine first.

433
00:17:27,901 --> 00:17:29,819
Milady.

434
00:17:29,866 --> 00:17:33,998
Mm, Kevin, did you wrap
these presents yourself?

435
00:17:34,092 --> 00:17:36,590
Once again, I'm not a dog.

436
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,099
Zoink.

437
00:17:39,887 --> 00:17:40,712
Doink.

438
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,132
Kevin, how do you tie a knot?

439
00:17:43,156 --> 00:17:44,539
Really simple.

440
00:17:44,883 --> 00:17:47,895
So you go...

441
00:17:47,913 --> 00:17:50,731
Make a little rabbit ear
like so,

442
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,515
then the kids go marching
down the well.

443
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:55,810
Oh... my... God.

444
00:17:55,823 --> 00:17:58,130
Professor,
you were never tied up.

445
00:17:58,165 --> 00:18:00,134
What?

446
00:18:00,597 --> 00:18:02,290
What do you want me to say?

447
00:18:05,281 --> 00:18:07,372
What do you want me to say?

448
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,460
That I did it
because I'm lonely?

449
00:18:09,492 --> 00:18:12,045
That my daughter isn't in town?

450
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,634
That she never comes to see me because
she finds me too manipulative?

451
00:18:16,894 --> 00:18:19,662
Or you could say you're sorry
for the whole thing.

452
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:22,866
Yes, I suppose
that would be accurate.

453
00:18:22,884 --> 00:18:25,297
And that, as compensation
for the mental anguish

454
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:27,368
you caused us,
you'll give us an "A".

455
00:18:27,394 --> 00:18:29,462
Jeff.
Overreaching?

456
00:18:29,482 --> 00:18:30,846
Fair enough.

457
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,556
Maybe you can grade
us separately.

458
00:18:32,567 --> 00:18:35,015
That way, Shirley and Annie
can get their "A" s.

459
00:18:35,034 --> 00:18:37,115
No, Jeffrey,
he can give us an "F"

460
00:18:37,121 --> 00:18:38,594
or you can give us an "A",

461
00:18:38,612 --> 00:18:41,413
but we should all get
the same grade.

462
00:18:41,438 --> 00:18:43,750
God's sake, don't rub it in.

463
00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:46,314
Very well.
Seeing as you saved me

464
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:50,646
from my yearly Christmas
tradition of plum pudding,

465
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:53,259
roasted goose,
and updating my suicide note...

466
00:18:54,019 --> 00:18:56,654
I suppose...

467
00:18:56,711 --> 00:18:58,632
I could give you a "C".

468
00:18:58,661 --> 00:19:00,595
- Oh.
- Uh.

469
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:02,584
Plus.

470
00:19:04,289 --> 00:19:05,839
Merry Christmas.

471
00:19:05,867 --> 00:19:08,452
Merry Christmas.

482
00:19:29,645 --> 00:19:31,012
No, there's a gift in there.

483
00:19:32,294 --> 00:19:33,294
Yeah.

484
00:19:33,313 --> 00:19:34,984
Buttered noodles.
My favorite.

485
00:19:35,009 --> 00:19:36,134
Oh!

486
00:19:36,177 --> 00:19:39,383
By the way, I didn't get anyone
gifts, so my gift to you all

487
00:19:39,405 --> 00:19:41,750
is you get to lord it over me
for the next year.

488
00:19:41,769 --> 00:19:44,748
No, stupid, a gift
doesn't create an obligation.

489
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:46,896
It's the obligation
that's a gift.

490
00:19:47,971 --> 00:19:49,605
I gotta drop a deuce.

491
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:51,857
See you guys.

492
00:19:54,662 --> 00:19:56,078
Hey, it's Chang.

493
00:19:56,097 --> 00:19:57,651
No, they're not expelled.

494
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,567
I have to do something else.

495
00:20:07,717 --> 00:20:11,824
Oh, how could I have stayed mad
at you, guys?

496
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:15,980
Here, I was gonna save these
for the real Christmas Day,

497
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,778
but these guys
were getting antsy.

498
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,125
Hi, there.

499
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:21,096
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.

500
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,963
Oh!

501
00:20:23,344 --> 00:20:24,269
August.

502
00:20:24,294 --> 00:20:27,057
And this one is James.

503
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:29,029
And this one is Fiona.

504
00:20:29,048 --> 00:20:32,474
And these two guys are Jeffrey.

505
00:20:32,492 --> 00:20:33,897
At nice times like this,

506
00:20:33,915 --> 00:20:35,635
I wonder what's happening
in the darkest timeline.

507
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:36,411
Timeline?

508
00:20:36,423 --> 00:20:39,451
Abed, there are
no dark timelines.

509
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:46,590
Your honor,
I may not have a right arm,

510
00:20:46,614 --> 00:20:49,137
but I am armed
with what's right.

511
00:20:49,201 --> 00:20:52,423
My client Miss Edison did rob
several drug stores,

512
00:20:52,461 --> 00:20:55,262
and, yes, she did stab
several pharmacists,

513
00:20:55,286 --> 00:20:57,770
but let's talk
about the bigger crime,

514
00:20:57,842 --> 00:21:03,096
that someone so beautiful
has been removed from society.

515
00:21:03,146 --> 00:21:06,402
Miss Edison,
you are hereby released

516
00:21:06,425 --> 00:21:09,201
from Greendale Insane Asylum.

517
00:21:09,538 --> 00:21:11,782
Are you sure you don't have a
problem with our age difference?

518
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,811
Yeah, I wish
you were even younger.

519
00:21:13,824 --> 00:21:15,686
Now, come on,
the others are waiting.

520
00:21:15,728 --> 00:21:18,250
We've got a prime timeline
to destroy.

521
00:21:24,131 --> 00:21:29,131
