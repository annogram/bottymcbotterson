00:05:20,326 --> 00:05:21,960
I mean it's out of business.

159
00:05:22,027 --> 00:05:24,295
- Well, that's what they get
for trying to please everyone.

160
00:05:24,363 --> 00:05:26,297
So now what?
- Well, there's a place

161
00:05:26,365 --> 00:05:27,632
At third and water.

162
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:30,300
It's fun, divey,
but not staph infection divey.

163
00:05:30,368 --> 00:05:34,237
It's either got a gross name
or an ironically fancy one.

164
00:05:34,305 --> 00:05:36,572
Possibly both.
- Oh. The ballroom. Good.

165
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,940

- Wait--what?

166
00:05:39,008 --> 00:05:41,143
That wasn't the deal!
- Shirley's pushing back.

167
00:05:41,211 --> 00:05:43,145
- Why, because they don't have
plastic menus and milk shakes?

168
00:05:43,213 --> 00:05:45,414
- Why, because they don't--
- don't repeat that, you goon!

Jeez. Look, just--
the women are your problem,

170
00:05:48,651 --> 00:05:50,318
And the men
are going to the ballroom.

171
00:05:50,385 --> 00:05:52,119
And now I guess I am
being clever.

are bad?

174

See, this is the kinda stuff
I need to learn.

175
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:00,993
Plastic menus seems like
a great idea to me

176
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,928
For when you spill
something on them,

177
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:04,329
And then your mom says,
"hey, troy,

178
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:06,130
You're ruining fuddruckers
for everyone."

the next chapter of your life.

Sadly, it's the final chapter,

181
00:06:10,401 --> 00:06:11,969
But it's also the longest.

182

And if you play it right,
the best.

We're just two guys now.

they'll be suspicious.

Because you're a hot girl.

The hotter you are,

at the red door.

316
00:11:09,939 --> 00:11:12,206
- I can't wait to understand
these arguments!

317
00:11:12,274 --> 00:11:13,507
- Hey, y'all,
'nother round for ya.

318
00:11:13,574 --> 00:11:14,840
Everybody holdin' up?

319
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:18,042
I'll be back in two shakes
of a rabbit's ass.

320
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,641
- Who the hell was that?

321
00:11:21,074 --> 00:11:22,208
- I gotta go see a woman

322
00:11:22,275 --> 00:11:24,142
About the female equivalent
of a horse.

323
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:26,311
- Classy.
Way to show troy the ropes.

324
00:11:26,378 --> 00:11:28,278
- Shut up, l street.

325
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,215
- That woman is a hurricane.

326
00:11:32,282 --> 00:11:34,217
- Yeah.

327
00:11:34,285 --> 00:11:36,053
- Hurricanes are bad, troy.

328
00:11:36,121 --> 00:11:37,555
- I know.

329
00:11:41,227 --> 00:11:42,894
- I always thought it's possible

330
00:11:42,962 --> 00:11:44,695
That the wormhole
crichton fell through

331
00:11:44,763 --> 00:11:46,664
Moved him across not only space
but also time,

332
00:11:46,731 --> 00:11:48,866
Which would suggest that the
sebaceans are our future selves

333
00:11:48,933 --> 00:11:51,067
And crichton is longing for
a planet that no longer exists.

334
00:11:51,135 --> 00:11:54,470
- Ha. Hey, you're really
nursing that beer.

335
00:11:57,006 --> 00:11:58,340
- Ahh. Which would make sense,

336
00:11:58,408 --> 00:11:59,974
Because what kind of
wormhole would it be

337
00:12:00,042 --> 00:12:01,743
If it could only move
from one place to another

338
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:03,344
Within the same galaxy
on the same day?

339
00:12:03,412 --> 00:12:04,745
- You know,
speaking of wormholes,

340
00:12:04,813 --> 00:12:07,080
Uh, whaddaya say
we use one to...

341
00:12:07,148 --> 00:12:10,517
Teleport this conversation
someplace a little more private?

342
00:12:10,584 --> 00:12:11,918
- That doesn't make any sense.

343
00:12:11,985 --> 00:12:14,119
Wormholes and teleportation
are two different things.

344
00:12:14,187 --> 00:12:16,088
That's what I've been talking
about this whole time.

345
00:12:16,155 --> 00:12:18,056
- I noticed.
- Cheers.

346
00:12:18,124 --> 00:12:20,625
- I followed that band phish--
spells it with "ph".

347
00:12:20,692 --> 00:12:22,793
I just lived in parking lots
wherever they played.

348
00:12:22,861 --> 00:12:24,028
I don't even like their music.

349
00:12:24,095 --> 00:12:25,362
Just did it to see
if I could do it.

350
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:26,897
And guess what.
I could!

351
00:12:26,964 --> 00:12:28,265
- So what now?
- I dunno!

352
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,533
Even if I planned it,
plans just fall off me

353
00:12:30,601 --> 00:12:33,269
Like chicken crap
off an armadilla.

354
00:12:33,337 --> 00:12:35,804
[chuckles] annie's the one
that plans things, not me.

355
00:12:35,872 --> 00:12:38,740
Annie's my friend.
She goes to school here.

356
00:12:38,808 --> 00:12:41,275
Thinks she's got it
all figured out.

357
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,210
She wants to major
in healthcare management.

358
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:45,245
What does that even mean?

359
00:12:45,313 --> 00:12:46,780
- No idea.

360
00:12:46,847 --> 00:12:48,281
- I'll tell you what it means.

361
00:12:48,348 --> 00:12:50,649
It means a master's degree
followed by an internship.

362
00:12:50,717 --> 00:12:52,784
She's got the next
15 years of her life

363
00:12:52,852 --> 00:12:54,386
All mapped out,
and all she gotta do now

364
00:12:54,453 --> 00:12:57,288
Is just follow it
or screw it up.

365
00:12:57,356 --> 00:12:58,289
- Another soda?

366
00:12:58,357 --> 00:13:00,491
- Actually,
gimme a screwdriver.

367
00:13:00,558 --> 00:13:02,492
I got no place to be.

368
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,161
What am I...Annie?

369
00:13:05,229 --> 00:13:07,296
- The first season, when you
watch it the second time,

370
00:13:07,364 --> 00:13:09,164
Is better than the third season,
and the fourth season,

371
00:13:09,232 --> 00:13:10,532
When you watch it
the fifth time--

372
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,267
- Okay. Um...
What's your name?

373
00:13:12,335 --> 00:13:13,268
- Abed.
- Abed, I'm robert.

374
00:13:13,336 --> 00:13:14,436
- Hey, robert.

375
00:13:14,504 --> 00:13:17,105
- Abed, would you
like to have...

376
00:13:17,173 --> 00:13:19,841
Gay sex...With me?

377
00:13:19,909 --> 00:13:22,276
- No, thank you.
- Wow.

378
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:24,545
Okay, so...
What is wrong with you

379
00:13:24,612 --> 00:13:26,814
That you can sit here
this whole time

380
00:13:26,881 --> 00:13:30,283
And never pick up on the fact
that a man is hitting on you?

381
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,117
- Oh, I actually did pick up
on it after a while.

382
00:13:32,185 --> 00:13:33,118
- You actually--

383
00:13:33,186 --> 00:13:34,353
And?

384
00:13:34,421 --> 00:13:36,488
<i>- I really, really like
talking about farscape.</i>

385
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:42,460
It's a really good show.

386
00:13:42,528 --> 00:13:43,827
<i>- Stargate's better.</i>

387

388
00:13:47,898 --> 00:13:49,565
Electronic voice:
Battery depleted.

389
00:13:49,632 --> 00:13:51,667
- Oh, man.

390
00:13:51,734 --> 00:13:53,835
Aw...

391
00:13:55,338 --> 00:13:57,072
[laughter]
- that is wrong!

392
00:13:59,074 --> 00:14:00,140
Wait.

393
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,141
- Oh!

394
00:14:01,209 --> 00:14:02,609
- Hey, there!

395
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:04,244
What you been up to?

396
00:14:04,312 --> 00:14:05,579
- I was just, uh,

397
00:14:05,647 --> 00:14:08,348
Praying for these poor souls
in these photographs.

398
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:09,949
- Oh, that's nice, but, uh...

399
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:11,850
You missed one.

400
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:14,852
I found it
in the ladies room.

401
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,521
- Uh...Give that to me?

402
00:14:16,588 --> 00:14:18,522
- No, no, come on!
Don't feel bad.

403
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:21,291
This makes us like you
way more.

404
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:22,759
- You think
this is really funny.

405
00:14:22,826 --> 00:14:23,760
- Yeah.
- Yeah, a little.

406
00:14:23,827 --> 00:14:26,329
- I had some bad years.

407
00:14:26,396 --> 00:14:27,963
With a chaser.

408
00:14:28,031 --> 00:14:29,331
- Come on.
It's a funny picture,

409
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:31,333
Because you act so perfect
all the time.

410
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,334
And because
you look like a zombie,

411
00:14:33,402 --> 00:14:35,302
But it's not funny
when you're sad.

412
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:36,636
We're on your team.
Relax.

413
00:14:36,704 --> 00:14:38,138
Sit down.
It's my birthday.

414
00:14:38,205 --> 00:14:39,805
- Give it to me.

415
00:14:39,873 --> 00:14:40,940
Give it to me.

416
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,442
See you all on Monday.

417
00:14:45,444 --> 00:14:46,877
- Sheesh.
- Oh...

418
00:14:46,945 --> 00:14:49,346
Britta: Blue town.

419
00:14:49,414 --> 00:14:51,615
Jeff: Shirley. Wait.

420
00:14:52,617 --> 00:14:54,017
- What?

421
00:14:54,085 --> 00:14:55,385
- Nothing.
Get out of my way!

422
00:14:55,453 --> 00:14:57,354
- I can't get out
of your way.

423
00:14:57,421 --> 00:14:59,789
I'm stuck in this pl--
the chair broke--

424
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:02,325
I mean, I can't get--

425
00:15:02,392 --> 00:15:05,227
Could you p-please help me?

426
00:15:05,295 --> 00:15:07,963
Pretty please?

427
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,798
Thank you, shirley.

428
00:15:09,865 --> 00:15:11,933
- You're welcome, jackass.

429
00:15:14,103 --> 00:15:16,270
- Hey, um, it's my birthday,

430
00:15:16,338 --> 00:15:18,171
And technically,
I'm not allowed to drink

431
00:15:18,239 --> 00:15:20,509
For another 45 seconds.

432
00:15:20,576 --> 00:15:21,910
Well, actually,
it'll be 30 seconds

433
00:15:21,978 --> 00:15:23,878
By the time I'm done
saying this.

434
00:15:23,946 --> 00:15:25,380
But can I have
a seven and seven?

435
00:15:25,447 --> 00:15:28,149
- It's on the house.
Happy birthday, kid.

<i>Britta:

Oh.

crash it, troy.

Go to sleep.

- Crash his car, troy!

chapter in our group story.

- Cool.

gone to tonight!

- Yeah, l street.
Exactly.

459
00:16:42,574 --> 00:16:45,142
- It's the red door, stupid!

460
00:16:45,209 --> 00:16:47,477
You see a sign
that says l street?

461

- L street is too cool
to have a sign.

462
00:16:48,946 --> 00:16:51,348
It's called l street
after the street it's on.

00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,237
- You wish!

475
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:19,571
- Stop. Just stop.

476
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:21,739
I just spent the last two years

477
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:24,208
Thinking that you guys
knew more than me about life,

478
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:27,711
And I just found out that you
guys are just as dumb as me.

479
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,213
- Duh-doy.

480
00:17:30,281 --> 00:17:33,549
- Yeah. Duh-doy.

481
00:17:33,617 --> 00:17:35,217
- Got it.

482
00:17:35,285 --> 00:17:38,486
Duh-doy.

483
00:17:38,554 --> 00:17:39,854
Duh-doy.

484
00:17:39,922 --> 00:17:41,221
- You can take me home first.

485
00:17:41,289 --> 00:17:43,089
I only live
a few blocks from here.

486
00:17:43,157 --> 00:17:44,424
- You do?

487
00:17:44,491 --> 00:17:46,859
- Hey, this is a really
terrible neighborhood.

488
00:17:46,927 --> 00:17:48,227
- Yeah.

489
00:17:50,729 --> 00:17:53,562
- This is my apartment.

490
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:55,764
Weird night, huh?

491
00:17:55,832 --> 00:17:58,232
- Yeah. Alcohol
makes people sad.

492
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,701
It's like the lifetime movies
of beverages.

493
00:18:00,768 --> 00:18:02,903
- I pretended to be
a different person tonight.

494
00:18:02,971 --> 00:18:04,873
- Abed does that
like three times a week.

495
00:18:04,941 --> 00:18:07,343
- But I did it because
I didn't wanna be me.

496
00:18:07,411 --> 00:18:10,278
I-I did it because

497
00:18:10,345 --> 00:18:11,612
I'm not sure who I am.

498
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,614
Admit it--we went to school
together for four years,

499
00:18:13,682 --> 00:18:15,716
And you didn't even
know me.

500
00:18:15,784 --> 00:18:18,252
- Yeah, but...
I know you now.

501
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,720
You're annie.

502
00:18:19,788 --> 00:18:21,521
You like puzzles and...

503
00:18:21,589 --> 00:18:23,122
Little monsters
on your pencil

504
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:25,157
And some guy
named mark ruffalo.

505
00:18:25,225 --> 00:18:28,259
You're a fierce competitor
and a sore loser.

506
00:18:28,327 --> 00:18:32,129
And you expect everybody
to be better than who they are

507
00:18:32,196 --> 00:18:35,433
And you expect yourself
to be better than everyone.

508
00:18:35,501 --> 00:18:37,468
Which is cool.

509
00:18:37,536 --> 00:18:39,336
[laughs]

510
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,308
Good night.

511
00:18:48,611 --> 00:18:50,279
- Guess everyone's gonna be
pretty embarrassed

512
00:18:50,346 --> 00:18:51,480
On Monday, huh?

513
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:54,415
- Naw. Everybody
just got a little bit drunk.

514
00:18:54,483 --> 00:18:56,450
Nobody did anything
that bad, right?

515
00:19:02,355 --> 00:19:04,289
- [slurring]
no, wait, wait, wait.

516
00:19:04,357 --> 00:19:06,757
What are we doing?

517
00:19:06,825 --> 00:19:08,726
- Yeah. What are we doing?

518
00:19:08,794 --> 00:19:10,895
- This is a bad idea,
right?

519
00:19:10,963 --> 00:19:12,730
- Yeah.

520
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:21,371
- Okay.

521
00:19:23,307 --> 00:19:26,208
I flew off the handle
earlier.

522
00:19:26,276 --> 00:19:28,810
I apologize.

523
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:33,013
- They were making out.

524
00:19:33,081 --> 00:19:34,914
- Abed!
- Abed, why would you say that?

525
00:19:34,982 --> 00:19:36,415
- Why would you do it
in front of me?

526
00:19:36,483 --> 00:19:37,850
I'm not a coat rack.

527
00:19:37,918 --> 00:19:39,285
- Abed.
- Mm-hmm.

528
00:19:39,352 --> 00:19:40,920
- No one likes a tattle tail.

529
00:19:43,156 --> 00:19:46,258
- Happy birthday, troy.

530
00:19:46,325 --> 00:19:47,826
- Thanks.

531
00:19:49,394 --> 00:19:51,362
- You're a man now.

532
00:20:03,489 --> 00:20:05,857
- I don't think
this is gonna be big enough.

533
00:20:05,925 --> 00:20:07,726
- Just try it--we're so close!
- All right. Breathe in.

534
00:20:07,793 --> 00:20:08,726
- [inhales]

535
00:20:08,794 --> 00:20:10,727
- All right.

536
00:20:10,795 --> 00:20:12,062
- [gasps]

537
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:13,430
- Arms.

538
00:20:13,497 --> 00:20:15,164
There we go.
There we go, yeah.

539
00:20:15,232 --> 00:20:19,501
- Ah!
[panting]

540
00:20:19,569 --> 00:20:21,203
- 157!
- We did it!

541
00:20:21,271 --> 00:20:23,739
- Yes.
[cell phone rings]

542
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:26,207
That you?
- Yeah.

543
00:20:26,275 --> 00:20:28,242
[ringing]
little help?

544
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,744
Hurry.
I think it's a girl!

545
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,745
- Left side or right side?
- Left side.

546
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,447
- Got it.
Tell me when I'm clo.

547
00:20:33,515 --> 00:20:34,414
- Okay.

548
