1
00:00:05,604 --> 00:00:07,188
- I see you, chubby ass!
- Oh!

2
00:00:07,256 --> 00:00:08,789
- I ain't chasing, chubby.
- No, no, no!

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,024
- Chubby-chaser.
- No!

4
00:00:10,092 --> 00:00:11,259
You can't outrun me.
I see you, fat-ass!

5
00:00:16,231 --> 00:00:17,481
Guys?

6
00:00:17,566 --> 00:00:19,934
Please, okay?
I don't even have a gun.

7
00:00:20,002 --> 00:00:20,985
Isn't this against the rules?

8
00:00:21,069 --> 00:00:23,237
There's only one rule,
Fat Neil.

9
00:00:23,305 --> 00:00:26,674
The prize goes
to the last man standing.

10
00:00:26,742 --> 00:00:27,675
So to speak.

11
00:00:29,011 --> 00:00:30,544
You--

12
00:00:32,414 --> 00:00:35,650
If you were a dude,
I'd have my fist up your balls.

13
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:41,222
Thank you, Annie.

14
00:00:41,289 --> 00:00:44,458
Kick their guns to me.

15
00:00:44,526 --> 00:00:46,193
Kick--don't reach.

16
00:00:46,261 --> 00:00:47,695
Hey!

17
00:00:47,763 --> 00:00:49,397
Christina "Reach-y",

18
00:00:49,464 --> 00:00:51,232
I said kick.

19
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,801
Annie, take it easy.

20
00:00:53,852 --> 00:00:56,470
You gotta learn
to trust people.

21
00:01:00,242 --> 00:01:02,510
Can't you leave me
with a little something?

22
00:01:02,577 --> 00:01:04,362
We're friends, Annie.

23
00:01:04,446 --> 00:01:06,614
Remember?

24
00:01:06,682 --> 00:01:08,349
We played Dungeons & Dragons together.

25
00:01:08,417 --> 00:01:10,418
That was a game.

26
00:01:13,822 --> 00:01:14,822
This is paintball.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

28
00:02:02,671 --> 00:02:04,905
Okay,
a couple of announcements.

29
00:02:04,973 --> 00:02:07,558
I want to thank Pistol Patty's
Cowboy Creamery

30
00:02:07,642 --> 00:02:09,744
for sponsoring
our end-of-the-year picnic.

31
00:02:09,811 --> 00:02:11,912
Now.

32
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,647
Free ice cream and that one guy

33
00:02:13,715 --> 00:02:15,182
having a heart attack

34
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,401
aren't the only surprises today.

35
00:02:17,486 --> 00:02:20,087
We're gonna end this year
with a quick game

36
00:02:20,155 --> 00:02:22,123
of Paintball Assassin.

37
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,407
Yeah.

38
00:02:23,492 --> 00:02:25,960
Last year's big mistake

39
00:02:26,028 --> 00:02:28,095
was way too valuable a prize.

40
00:02:28,163 --> 00:02:29,930
And I've been assured--

41
00:02:29,998 --> 00:02:31,082
Eh?

42
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:32,733
That this year
will be different.

43
00:02:32,801 --> 00:02:37,071
So take it away, Pistol Patty!

44
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:38,906
Howdy, folks.

45
00:02:38,974 --> 00:02:40,274
There's only one rule.

46
00:02:40,342 --> 00:02:42,777
Last man standing
gets the prize.

47
00:02:42,844 --> 00:02:46,080
There's your guns.

48
00:02:46,131 --> 00:02:48,432
And here's the prize.

49
00:02:48,517 --> 00:02:51,852
$100,000 cash.

50
00:02:53,755 --> 00:02:55,356
Go nuts!

51
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:23,050
I heard a rumor you never
shoot an unarmed man.

52
00:03:23,118 --> 00:03:24,885
Whoever started that rumor
didn't eat my beans.

53
00:03:24,953 --> 00:03:27,188
Then I guess it's lucky for me
I'm not unarmed.

54
00:03:30,258 --> 00:03:33,594
Seeing as I'm...

55
00:03:33,662 --> 00:03:36,797
Eating your beans.

56
00:03:39,134 --> 00:03:40,234
Jeff wants to see you.

57
00:03:40,302 --> 00:03:42,269
Yeah?
And I want pants.

58
00:03:42,337 --> 00:03:43,537
A lot of people
want a lot of things.

59
00:03:43,605 --> 00:03:44,738
It won't hurt
to hear him out, will it?

60
00:03:44,806 --> 00:03:46,707
We got a good hiding spot
in the library.

61
00:03:46,775 --> 00:03:49,410
As safe as you are here,
you'll be safer with us.

62
00:03:52,864 --> 00:03:54,515
Look.

63
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,316
Math club's gotten a lot
better since last year.

64
00:03:56,368 --> 00:03:57,751
Obviously, they were practicing

65
00:03:57,819 --> 00:03:59,653
while the rest of us
went on dates.

66
00:04:01,223 --> 00:04:03,624
Hold on.
I have a plan.

67
00:04:03,675 --> 00:04:04,792
Math club!

68
00:04:04,843 --> 00:04:05,926
Yeah.

69
00:04:05,994 --> 00:04:07,561
I'm Asian.

70
00:04:07,629 --> 00:04:09,597
You guys Asian?

71
00:04:09,664 --> 00:04:11,532
That's pretty racist, man.

72
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,033
That wasn't a no.

73
00:04:13,101 --> 00:04:14,702
I'm coming over!

74
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:15,886
Don't shoot me, shoot him.

75
00:04:15,971 --> 00:04:17,438
He's white,
and he's out of ammo.

76
00:04:17,506 --> 00:04:20,191
Crap.

77
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:37,558
Shoot Chang!

78
00:04:37,626 --> 00:04:39,243
He defected to the math club.

79
00:04:39,327 --> 00:04:41,528
- Math club!
- Agh.

80
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,547
Forget it.

81
00:04:43,632 --> 00:04:44,798
Just a waste of ammo.

82
00:04:44,866 --> 00:04:46,066
Let's go grab their paint.

83
00:04:46,134 --> 00:04:49,103
Yeah, I'm much safer
with you guys.

84
00:04:49,171 --> 00:04:50,104
M'lady.

85
00:04:50,172 --> 00:04:51,672
What do you want, Jeff?

86
00:04:51,723 --> 00:04:53,040
Yikes.
Well, what do we all want?

87
00:04:53,091 --> 00:04:54,375
Ammo.

88
00:04:54,442 --> 00:04:55,476
How much you got left?

89
00:04:55,544 --> 00:04:56,810
$100,000 worth.

90
00:04:56,878 --> 00:04:57,811
Yeah, we're running low, too.

91
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:58,946
- Shut up, Abed.
- Okay.

92
00:04:59,014 --> 00:05:00,781
What have you heard
about Pierce?

93
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:02,616
I hear he's still alive,

94
00:05:02,684 --> 00:05:03,817
holed up near the cafeteria.

95
00:05:03,885 --> 00:05:05,019
Well, I hear he has more paint

96
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,153
than a French kindergarten.

97
00:05:06,221 --> 00:05:08,122
Are you proposing we join him?

98
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,723
I'm proposing
his ammo joins us.

99
00:05:09,774 --> 00:05:11,425
You haven't changed.

100
00:05:11,493 --> 00:05:12,576
You think Pierce has?

101
00:05:12,661 --> 00:05:13,744
Annie, let's not rehash this.

102
00:05:13,828 --> 00:05:14,895
The guy's been a jerk all year.

103
00:05:14,963 --> 00:05:16,497
He's a jerk
because we exclude him.

104
00:05:16,565 --> 00:05:18,632
We exclude him
because he's a jerk.

105
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,634
And the last time I checked,
you were the last one

106
00:05:20,702 --> 00:05:23,254
feeling sorry about it.

107
00:05:34,983 --> 00:05:37,518
I guess I'm still waiting
for you guys to come around.

108
00:05:37,586 --> 00:05:39,270
Likewise.

109
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:42,806
Okay, I'm--
I am dead now.

110
00:05:42,891 --> 00:05:44,091
I'm dead.

111
00:05:46,561 --> 00:05:48,529
Who wears spurs in paintball?

112
00:06:03,378 --> 00:06:05,346
Who the hell are you?

113
00:06:05,413 --> 00:06:08,215
The guy that's gonna win.

114
00:06:16,591 --> 00:06:18,892
Come on!

115
00:06:25,133 --> 00:06:27,134
Does that guy
even go to this school?

116
00:06:27,185 --> 00:06:28,135
He's really good-looking.

117
00:06:28,186 --> 00:06:30,004
Like, network TV good-looking.

118
00:06:30,071 --> 00:06:31,505
And did you see how big
his guns were?

119
00:06:31,573 --> 00:06:32,840
Why don't you just
marry him, Abed?

120
00:06:32,907 --> 00:06:33,974
I'm just saying
paintball is tough this year.

121
00:06:34,042 --> 00:06:35,242
I agree.

122
00:06:37,746 --> 00:06:38,662
Careful, Britta.

123
00:06:38,747 --> 00:06:39,913
You can't hit all three of us.

124
00:06:39,981 --> 00:06:41,282
She won't have to.

125
00:06:46,538 --> 00:06:48,505
- Hey, Troy.
- Abed!

126
00:06:50,325 --> 00:06:51,825
- I thought you were dead.
- I thought you were dead.

127
00:06:51,876 --> 00:06:54,261
- Guys.
- Oh, right.

128
00:06:54,329 --> 00:06:56,513
By the power invested
in us as deputies,

129
00:06:56,598 --> 00:06:58,732
we now pronounce you arrested.

130
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,768
Deputies? What are you,
Deputies of the Stairwell?

131
00:07:00,835 --> 00:07:02,603
Fort Hawthorne.

132
00:07:02,671 --> 00:07:05,105
There's a bounty
on your head, my friend.

133
00:07:05,173 --> 00:07:07,474
Hm.

134
00:07:07,542 --> 00:07:10,511
Pierce.

135
00:07:10,578 --> 00:07:11,745
My forehead's
not that big, right?

136
00:07:11,813 --> 00:07:13,881
- Mm.
- It's not small.

137
00:07:17,171 --> 00:07:19,062
So you guys let Pierce boss you around

138
00:07:19,182 --> 00:07:20,424
in exchange for paint pellets?

139
00:07:20,425 --> 00:07:21,792
Actually, Jeff,
he's been pretty decent

140
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:22,859
in this game so far.

141
00:07:22,927 --> 00:07:24,160
He's created a safe zone

142
00:07:24,212 --> 00:07:25,512
where people can rest, eat,
and if necessary,

143
00:07:25,596 --> 00:07:26,797
pump their breast milk.

144
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:28,348
Wow, that sounds
very nice of him.

145
00:07:28,433 --> 00:07:30,083
Beats standing around
with empty guns,

146
00:07:30,151 --> 00:07:32,001
waiting to get picked off
by the Black Rider.

147
00:07:32,053 --> 00:07:34,104
Are you talking
about the handsome blond cowboy

148
00:07:34,172 --> 00:07:35,338
with the big guns?

149
00:07:35,406 --> 00:07:36,406
Is that guy a student?

150
00:07:36,474 --> 00:07:37,441
Who--who is he?

151
00:07:37,508 --> 00:07:38,742
We just call him
the Black Rider.

152
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:40,577
Okay, but he's not really
riding anything.

153
00:07:40,645 --> 00:07:42,379
Look, I don't name people,
Annie.

154
00:07:42,447 --> 00:07:43,713
I'm a deputy.

155
00:07:43,781 --> 00:07:45,549
I deputize.

156
00:07:45,616 --> 00:07:47,584
You have to surrender
your guns.

157
00:07:47,652 --> 00:07:50,253
Oh, and your drugs.

158
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:10,073
Ah.

159
00:08:10,141 --> 00:08:12,225
My study group.

160
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,310
How long has it been?

161
00:08:13,377 --> 00:08:15,111
- Five hours.
- Too long.

162
00:08:15,179 --> 00:08:16,947
Welcome to Fort Hawthorne.

163
00:08:17,014 --> 00:08:19,249
How is this even possible?

164
00:08:19,317 --> 00:08:21,234
It began with a dream, Annie.

165
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:24,020
A dream and an impulse to hide
in the men's room.

166
00:08:24,088 --> 00:08:26,072
I found that people
were willing to roll bullets

167
00:08:26,157 --> 00:08:27,557
under the door,

168
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,059
just for the right
to take a dump.

169
00:08:29,126 --> 00:08:30,393
By the way, for you guys,

170
00:08:30,461 --> 00:08:32,796
taking a dump's on the house.

171
00:08:32,864 --> 00:08:36,249
Or if you prefer,
relax and catch a show.

172
00:08:39,203 --> 00:08:41,171
This is insane.

173
00:08:41,239 --> 00:08:42,405
Don't worry, Jeff.

174
00:08:42,473 --> 00:08:46,776
I've also got someone
more your speed.

175
00:08:46,844 --> 00:08:48,011
Because you're gay.

176
00:08:48,079 --> 00:08:49,346
All right,
I think I've seen enough,

177
00:08:49,413 --> 00:08:51,798
and I'd like my gun back now.

178
00:08:51,883 --> 00:08:53,416
Only Hawthorne personnel

179
00:08:53,484 --> 00:08:56,353
can carry weapons
inside, Jeffrey.

180
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,821
All right,
you got us here unarmed,

181
00:08:57,889 --> 00:08:58,855
at your mercy.

182
00:08:58,923 --> 00:08:59,856
What do you want?

183
00:08:59,924 --> 00:09:00,941
We'll discuss over dinner.

184
00:09:01,025 --> 00:09:01,992
You're famished.

185
00:09:02,059 --> 00:09:04,811
Tonight, we feast.

186
00:09:07,598 --> 00:09:11,968
Ah, the twinkies
are wonderful tonight.

187
00:09:12,036 --> 00:09:14,604
Give us some space, Miguel.

188
00:09:17,074 --> 00:09:19,609
What if I told you guys
I know where to find

189
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,712
enough ammo to end
this cowardly hiding out

190
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:25,215
and split the prize seven ways?

191
00:09:25,282 --> 00:09:26,299
So send your goons to get it.

192
00:09:26,384 --> 00:09:27,551
Ah, they'd never bring it back.

193
00:09:27,618 --> 00:09:29,452
We trust each other.
We're a study group.

194
00:09:29,503 --> 00:09:31,287
That's pretty warm
and fuzzy talk

195
00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:32,756
coming from you, Pierce.

196
00:09:32,807 --> 00:09:34,140
Mm-hmm, you've kind of acted
like a villain this year.

197
00:09:34,225 --> 00:09:35,842
- I have?
- Well--

198
00:09:35,927 --> 00:09:36,977
- A little bit.
- You guys.

199
00:09:37,061 --> 00:09:40,797
Pierce is reaching out.

200
00:09:40,865 --> 00:09:42,799
I'm not risking my butt
hauling ammo back

201
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,985
for the guy that has Vicky
dancing for twinkies.

202
00:09:45,069 --> 00:09:47,137
She's a dance major, Jeff.

203
00:09:47,204 --> 00:09:48,488
And she loves twinkies.

204
00:09:48,573 --> 00:09:50,273
And if you ever took the time
to get to know her--

205
00:09:50,324 --> 00:09:51,374
Look.

206
00:09:51,442 --> 00:09:55,645
Uh, summer starts tomorrow.

207
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:58,415
For you guys,
it means pool parties,

208
00:09:58,482 --> 00:10:01,885
dinners,
one-night stands.

209
00:10:01,953 --> 00:10:04,321
For me...

210
00:10:04,388 --> 00:10:08,425
It means counting down the days
'til next fall.

211
00:10:08,492 --> 00:10:11,795
Before we go,
let me do this for you.

212
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:15,048
Let me bring us victory.

213
00:10:35,069 --> 00:10:36,352
Fine.

214
00:10:36,404 --> 00:10:38,555
Let's do it.

215
00:10:38,623 --> 00:10:39,556
To the study group.

216
00:10:39,624 --> 00:10:42,525
To the study group.

217
00:10:42,593 --> 00:10:43,760
Ah.

218
00:10:43,828 --> 00:10:45,361
More juice, Miguel.

219
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:49,833
I hope we find this cache
of ammunition soon.

220
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,867
I need to pump.

221
00:10:50,935 --> 00:10:52,902
Me, too.

222
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,237
You talkin' about peeing,
right?

223
00:10:54,305 --> 00:10:56,039
- No.
- Me, neither.

224
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,540
Okay, about Pierce.

225
00:10:57,608 --> 00:10:59,059
I feel bad.

226
00:10:59,143 --> 00:11:00,710
I shouldn't put
so much effort into--

227
00:11:00,778 --> 00:11:02,312
It's okay.
I just think--

228
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,913
The study group
is my family, you know?

229
00:11:03,981 --> 00:11:05,315
And if we start
picking and choosing--

230
00:11:05,383 --> 00:11:06,983
Where do we stop?

231
00:11:07,051 --> 00:11:08,718
I get it.

232
00:11:08,786 --> 00:11:10,120
You're a good kid.

233
00:11:10,187 --> 00:11:12,922
And I wanna do my part
to help you stay that way.

234
00:11:17,061 --> 00:11:18,361
Benjamin Chang,

235
00:11:18,429 --> 00:11:20,430
for your betrayal
of the Cheerleaders' Alliance,

236
00:11:20,498 --> 00:11:22,615
I sentence you
to pretendsies death.

237
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,117
Guys?

238
00:11:24,201 --> 00:11:25,835
You don't have to do this.

239
00:11:25,903 --> 00:11:27,270
I betrayed the math club
for you.

240
00:11:27,338 --> 00:11:28,404
- Ready...
- Heather!

241
00:11:28,456 --> 00:11:30,140
I'm sorry I told Trish
about Amber!

242
00:11:30,207 --> 00:11:32,459
- Aim...
- Fire.

243
00:11:36,213 --> 00:11:38,448
- Holy crap.
- Not cool, bitch.

244
00:11:38,516 --> 00:11:40,850
Yeah, so you told me
at last year's tryouts.

245
00:11:40,918 --> 00:11:43,153
Leave the guns.

246
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,355
Whatev.

247
00:11:45,422 --> 00:11:46,690
Who's there?

248
00:11:46,757 --> 00:11:47,691
Can I join you?

249
00:11:47,758 --> 00:11:51,260
- No!
- Okay.

250
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:53,530
Damn it, I'm out.
Gimme your gun.

251
00:11:53,597 --> 00:11:55,448
All right, be careful.

252
00:11:55,533 --> 00:11:57,484
Cheerleaders rule!

253
00:12:07,878 --> 00:12:10,814
I'll take that.

254
00:12:10,881 --> 00:12:13,133
Who are you?

255
00:12:13,217 --> 00:12:15,284
I'm the bad guy.

256
00:12:15,336 --> 00:12:18,788
Stop trying to fluster me
with your handsomeness.

257
00:12:18,856 --> 00:12:20,023
You're creepy.

258
00:12:20,091 --> 00:12:22,308
Then why is your chest
getting all flushed?

259
00:12:22,393 --> 00:12:24,460
It's a rash.

260
00:12:24,512 --> 00:12:26,663
I'm allergic to beans.

261
00:12:26,731 --> 00:12:28,865
Look, do you even go
to school here?

262
00:12:28,933 --> 00:12:31,067
Sorry, I get paid
to shoot paintballs, honey.

263
00:12:31,135 --> 00:12:32,068
Not the breeze.

264
00:12:32,136 --> 00:12:33,686
Lame.

265
00:12:33,771 --> 00:12:35,488
I'll hit you in the foot.

266
00:12:35,573 --> 00:12:38,208
Thank you.

267
00:12:43,547 --> 00:12:46,499
You're dry, sugar.

268
00:12:48,485 --> 00:12:50,537
Hey.

269
00:12:50,621 --> 00:12:52,322
Hey.

270
00:12:57,211 --> 00:12:59,045
I'll save you for last.

271
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,014
You won't get the chance.

272
00:13:17,481 --> 00:13:19,365
You okay?

273
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:20,533
I got a better look at him.

274
00:13:20,618 --> 00:13:21,684
He's not that good-looking.

275
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:23,519
- Didn't he shoot you?
- He tried.

276
00:13:23,571 --> 00:13:24,571
He's a bad shot, too?

277
00:13:24,655 --> 00:13:25,822
Man, what does this guy

278
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:26,956
have going for him?

279
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:33,196
Pierce loaded your gun
with blanks.

280
00:13:41,939 --> 00:13:43,473
Don't--don't--don't shoot!

281
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:47,043
Why does this keep happening?

282
00:13:48,395 --> 00:13:51,264
And what kind of ice cream
company does this?

283
00:13:51,348 --> 00:13:52,715
Where's the paintball stuff
from last year?

284
00:13:52,783 --> 00:13:53,917
I hid it

285
00:13:53,984 --> 00:13:55,435
so the school doesn't get
destroyed again.

286
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,654
Too late.

287
00:13:57,721 --> 00:13:58,788
Oh, hi, Jeff.

288
00:13:58,856 --> 00:14:00,557
We just ran
into the Black Rider.

289
00:14:00,624 --> 00:14:02,992
Dean, if you want this game
to end,

290
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,495
we need firepower.

291
00:14:06,564 --> 00:14:10,300
In there.

292
00:14:10,367 --> 00:14:12,502
The key's in my shorts.

293
00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:21,127
I can get it out, I guess.

294
00:14:24,915 --> 00:14:28,484
Now, this is more like it.

295
00:14:28,552 --> 00:14:29,652
Okay, Black Rider.

296
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,423
Now let's see who's attractive.

297
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,526
Dude, you have a problem.

298
00:14:36,593 --> 00:14:37,527
Whoa.

299
00:14:37,595 --> 00:14:41,698
Oh, nice.

300
00:14:41,765 --> 00:14:43,700
Whoa, where you going?

301
00:14:43,767 --> 00:14:46,119
To have a conversation
with Pierce.

302
00:14:46,203 --> 00:14:48,277
She's pretty awesome today.

303
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,290
What happened?

304
00:15:00,374 --> 00:15:01,437
Black Rider.

305
00:15:01,912 --> 00:15:02,946
He wiped out the whole fort.

306
00:15:03,562 --> 00:15:05,463
Then why are you still here?

307
00:15:05,531 --> 00:15:06,993
I can't go back out there.

308
00:15:06,994 --> 00:15:08,794
This is the only life I know.

309
00:15:08,846 --> 00:15:11,698
Annie?

310
00:15:11,765 --> 00:15:14,584
Is that you?

311
00:15:14,652 --> 00:15:16,302
D'you get the ammo?

312
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:18,471
Yep.

313
00:15:18,522 --> 00:15:21,074
Annie!
What are you doing?

314
00:15:21,141 --> 00:15:22,975
Why was Jeff's gun loaded
with blanks?

315
00:15:23,027 --> 00:15:24,494
Was it?

316
00:15:24,578 --> 00:15:26,996
Agh! Okay, okay, okay!

317
00:15:30,918 --> 00:15:31,884
Oh, coming out.

318
00:15:31,952 --> 00:15:36,889
Hey, hey.

319
00:15:36,957 --> 00:15:39,092
Oh, okay.

320
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:40,259
I get it.

321
00:15:40,327 --> 00:15:41,661
So once again, I'm the bad guy.

322
00:15:41,712 --> 00:15:42,929
Yes.

323
00:15:42,996 --> 00:15:45,498
Well, he got to win last year.

324
00:15:45,566 --> 00:15:47,667
It's a game, Annie.
It's j--

325
00:15:47,735 --> 00:15:48,935
Fine.

326
00:15:49,002 --> 00:15:51,437
It's a game.

327
00:15:51,505 --> 00:15:53,439
Let's play.

328
00:15:56,644 --> 00:15:57,777
Put it in your holster.

329
00:15:57,845 --> 00:15:59,045
Come on, Annie.

330
00:15:59,113 --> 00:16:00,563
You're my favorite.
I don't wanna beat you.

331
00:16:00,648 --> 00:16:02,782
It's just that I don't want
Jeff to be--

332
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:04,250
Put the gun in your holster,

333
00:16:04,318 --> 00:16:05,618
and let's play the game.

334
00:16:05,686 --> 00:16:07,820
Right.

335
00:16:07,888 --> 00:16:12,024
So you can shoot me
and play without me.

336
00:16:12,076 --> 00:16:13,960
That's this group's
favorite thing.

337
00:16:14,027 --> 00:16:15,528
We're always nice
to you, Pierce.

338
00:16:15,579 --> 00:16:16,963
Wrong.

339
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:19,165
Wrong!

340
00:16:19,233 --> 00:16:20,800
Three days ago,
I walked in on you guys

341
00:16:20,867 --> 00:16:22,585
playing cards without me.

342
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,636
Three days ago!

343
00:16:23,704 --> 00:16:25,972
We weren't playing cards.

344
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,807
We were voting,
and you weren't invited

345
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,242
because we were voting
about you.

346
00:16:29,309 --> 00:16:30,877
What?

347
00:16:30,944 --> 00:16:33,513
We were taking a vote...

348
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:36,399
On whether we'd invite you
back to the group next year.

349
00:16:40,688 --> 00:16:43,573
Lucky for you,
it had to be unanimous.

350
00:16:43,657 --> 00:16:45,725
There was one holdout.

351
00:16:45,793 --> 00:16:48,161
One red card.

352
00:17:05,345 --> 00:17:07,013
Pick it up.

353
00:17:44,752 --> 00:17:46,586
Black Rider...

354
00:17:46,653 --> 00:17:49,222
It's Jeff Winger.

355
00:17:49,289 --> 00:17:51,691
I know you've heard
of me by now.

356
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:53,993
No.

357
00:17:54,061 --> 00:17:55,478
He's lying.

358
00:17:55,562 --> 00:17:58,514
Look, if you're half
the cool cowboy

359
00:17:58,599 --> 00:17:59,699
you pretend to be,

360
00:17:59,767 --> 00:18:00,733
you'll respect that we've got

361
00:18:00,801 --> 00:18:02,702
a situation playing out here

362
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:04,303
and let us be
until it's settled.

363
00:18:04,371 --> 00:18:05,972
Sure thing.

364
00:18:10,744 --> 00:18:13,162
And once it's settled...

365
00:18:13,247 --> 00:18:15,248
I'm taking out everybody
in this room.

366
00:18:15,315 --> 00:18:16,349
Oh.

367
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:19,552
Starting with you,
Mr. Insecure.

368
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,622
You think you're good-looking,
but you're not.

369
00:18:22,689 --> 00:18:24,991
You're average.

370
00:18:25,058 --> 00:18:26,292
You're just
an average-looking guy

371
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,760
with a big chin.

372
00:18:50,984 --> 00:18:52,552
- What's going on?
- He's faking it.

373
00:18:52,619 --> 00:18:53,736
No, something's wrong with him.

374
00:18:53,821 --> 00:18:54,737
No, no, it's fake.

375
00:18:54,822 --> 00:18:55,988
Last week he did it

376
00:18:56,056 --> 00:18:57,290
to get out of letting me have
a stick of gum.

377
00:18:57,357 --> 00:18:58,524
He's old, though.
Could be real.

378
00:18:58,592 --> 00:19:00,126
It's real.
It is.

379
00:19:01,361 --> 00:19:02,528
The gurgling's a nice touch.

380
00:19:02,596 --> 00:19:04,297
You guys are terrible people.

381
00:19:04,364 --> 00:19:06,232
- Ah, we warned you.
- Buddy, are you all right?

382
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,466
You want me to call 911?

383
00:19:08,752 --> 00:19:10,603
Sucker!

384
00:19:10,671 --> 00:19:12,038
- Wait, seriously?
- Told you, dude.

385
00:19:12,105 --> 00:19:13,923
- I'm the best!
- You're the worst.

386
00:19:14,007 --> 00:19:15,808
I'm out of the group?

387
00:19:15,876 --> 00:19:17,643
You're out of mine!

388
00:19:17,711 --> 00:19:19,645
And I'm winning!

389
00:19:19,713 --> 00:19:20,813
We've created a monster.

390
00:19:20,881 --> 00:19:22,915
Let's not give ourselves
too much credit.

391
00:19:22,983 --> 00:19:24,150
I'm out.

392
00:19:24,217 --> 00:19:26,068
Some old guy pretended
to have a heart attack.

393
00:19:26,153 --> 00:19:27,320
Shot me in the gut.

394
00:19:27,387 --> 00:19:30,189
I don't care.
That's your problem.

395
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,274
This school sucks.

396
00:19:31,358 --> 00:19:32,959
Well, then why do you go here?

397
00:19:33,026 --> 00:19:34,160
I wouldn't go to this toilet

398
00:19:34,228 --> 00:19:35,995
with my big sister's toe.

399
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:38,397
I take a class online.

400
00:19:38,465 --> 00:19:39,799
I was paid to be here
and win the game

401
00:19:39,867 --> 00:19:41,167
so my boss could keep
his prize money.

402
00:19:41,235 --> 00:19:43,669
You work
for the ice cream company?

403
00:19:43,737 --> 00:19:45,705
Sweetie, this thing
is so much bigger

404
00:19:45,772 --> 00:19:48,207
than you can even imagine.

405
00:19:48,258 --> 00:19:49,408
I'm outta here.

406
00:19:49,459 --> 00:19:52,378
I got Coldplay tickets.

407
00:19:52,429 --> 00:19:53,746
Coldplay?

408
00:19:53,797 --> 00:19:55,281
Too late, bean allergy.

409
00:19:55,349 --> 00:19:57,633
You blew it.

410
00:19:57,718 --> 00:20:00,303
Hello?

411
00:20:00,387 --> 00:20:02,521
Anybody?

412
00:20:02,589 --> 00:20:05,191
Does anyone have an alliance
I can join?

413
00:20:05,259 --> 00:20:08,945
I'm really loyal.

414
00:20:09,029 --> 00:20:10,146
Agh!

415
00:20:15,736 --> 00:20:17,937
Am I out?

416
00:20:31,551 --> 00:20:33,669
No Greendale student
can be allowed

417
00:20:33,754 --> 00:20:35,338
to win this game.

418
00:20:35,422 --> 00:20:39,592
Initiate plan B:
Operation Total Invasion.

419

420
00:20:49,443 --> 00:20:51,478
Greendale students,

421
00:20:51,546 --> 00:20:53,363
I understand you've unified,

422
00:20:53,447 --> 00:20:56,082
and intend
to draw this game out.

423
00:20:56,150 --> 00:21:00,320
Well, if it's a war you want,
it's a war you shall lose.

424
00:21:00,388 --> 00:21:04,324
Resistance is as pointless
as your degrees.

425
00:21:06,761 --> 00:21:08,695
- Are we the little rascals?
- I was.

426
00:21:08,763 --> 00:21:11,164
I'm on your team!
Stop shooting me!

427
00:21:11,232 --> 00:21:12,832
We're gonna lose this war,
and this school!

428
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,434
- Looks like this is it.
- We're dying out here!

429
00:21:14,502 --> 00:21:15,635
I had a dream
it would end this way.

430
00:21:15,703 --> 00:21:16,803
Once I'm gone, I'm gone.

431
00:21:16,871 --> 00:21:17,921
Then I guess
I'll see you in hell.

432
00:21:17,989 --> 00:21:20,138
That's just the tip
of the iceberg.

433
00:21:21,305 --> 00:21:27,832
