1
00:00:01,688 --> 00:00:03,989
Jeff, we've known each other
a long time, right?

2
00:00:04,149 --> 00:00:06,866
- You've come to respect me.
- Sure.

3
00:00:07,027 --> 00:00:09,079
Well, get ready to stop.

4
00:00:09,321 --> 00:00:13,461
Please, help me seduce Britta now
that you've finished doing it with her.

5
00:00:13,617 --> 00:00:15,419
- Please.
- Do you even like Britta?

6
00:00:15,577 --> 00:00:18,080
Seems like you like her
because she doesn't like you.

7
00:00:18,246 --> 00:00:20,086
Have you met the women
that do like me?

8
00:00:20,248 --> 00:00:22,585
Neither have I, but trust me,
they're bad people.

9
00:00:22,751 --> 00:00:25,681
Fine. To get near Britta,
think like Britta.

10
00:00:25,837 --> 00:00:29,183
Grab one of those free papers
for hippies, go to the calendar page...

11
00:00:29,341 --> 00:00:32,390
...and find a cause so tragic...
Are you writing this down?

12
00:00:32,552 --> 00:00:36,978
We have confirmation that all the bones
were removed from the football field.

13
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,438
We agree teachers should get
a 10-minute head start at the job fair.

14
00:00:40,602 --> 00:00:41,990
Any other items?

15
00:00:42,729 --> 00:00:45,695
It's Friday night.
What's everybody doing?

16
00:00:45,857 --> 00:00:50,117
Oh, there's a benefit show
at the Forefront Theatre in Riverside...

17
00:00:50,278 --> 00:00:53,707
...for starving children
with cleft palates.

18
00:00:55,158 --> 00:00:59,038
Crash the premiere of the Kickpuncher
reboot dressed as classic Kickpuncher.

19
00:00:59,204 --> 00:01:02,798
They shouldn't have redesigned that
costume. Keep your heads in the sand.

20
00:01:02,958 --> 00:01:06,256
Professor Duncan, I didn't know
that cause interested you.

21
00:01:06,419 --> 00:01:08,804
It's starving children
with cleft palates, Britta.

22
00:01:08,964 --> 00:01:11,348
What part would you have me
be disinterested in?

23
00:01:11,508 --> 00:01:14,011
Forefront Theatre?
What time? I'm going.

24
00:01:15,679 --> 00:01:16,972
- I'm going too.
- Me too.

25
00:01:17,138 --> 00:01:20,852
Kids with cleft palates should have
extra food, not less. I'm in.

26
00:01:21,852 --> 00:01:25,695
I have dinner plans.

27
00:01:25,856 --> 00:01:28,703
- Really?
- Yeah, make sure it's a hearty meal.

28
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:30,116
- Butter!
- Help me out here.

29
00:01:30,277 --> 00:01:32,661
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Well...

30
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,995
Are you really the one
that needs help here, Winger?

31
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:39,460
Should we write a cheque
to the Jeff Foundation?

32
00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:41,874
Okay, maybe I'll go too.

33
00:01:42,038 --> 00:01:43,675
Well, it's the least you can do.

34
00:01:43,832 --> 00:01:45,588
Yeah, feels good to help.

35
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,590
God bless you.

36
00:01:48,378 --> 00:01:51,012
Cool, so 7:30?

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

38
00:02:18,742 --> 00:02:19,869
Sure, open arms.

39
00:02:20,035 --> 00:02:21,921
Did you get it? I don't think I got it.

40
00:02:22,078 --> 00:02:25,507
Well, the ants were people.
The queen ant was an oil company.

41
00:02:25,665 --> 00:02:28,679
Okay, so it was about our
marginalized perceptions as drones...

42
00:02:28,835 --> 00:02:33,557
- ...born into a corporate hive mind?
- Yeah, wow.

43
00:02:33,715 --> 00:02:36,100
- McDonald's?
- Oh, I was just thinking about that.

44
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:37,600
- Hungry.
- Hello?

45
00:02:37,761 --> 00:02:39,730
Okay, Alessandra,
I can't talk right now.

46
00:02:39,888 --> 00:02:41,691
I just got out of a show.

47
00:02:42,015 --> 00:02:43,736
Okay, hold on.

48
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,900
Well?

49
00:02:47,646 --> 00:02:50,030
Look, if you're gonna just
yell at me, why even...?

50
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,862
Why are you doing this?

51
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:56,457
This is not happening to you,
okay, it's happening to us!

52
00:02:56,613 --> 00:02:58,665
Well, you called me!

53
00:02:58,824 --> 00:03:03,165
Well, then let me be the one
to do this!

54
00:03:14,506 --> 00:03:18,018
My mother used to tell a story
about how she killed a chicken.

55
00:03:21,304 --> 00:03:24,022
Hong Kong, 1964.

56
00:03:24,182 --> 00:03:26,686
- So you like the theatre, Ian?
- Oh, are you kidding?

57
00:03:26,852 --> 00:03:29,865
I spent half my days at university
in wigs and tights.

58
00:03:30,021 --> 00:03:33,118
You don't do that
without befriending some actors.

59
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:34,861
Oh, my God, Michael.

60
00:03:35,026 --> 00:03:37,114
I know Michael
from my anarchist days.

61
00:03:37,279 --> 00:03:40,209
God, he's gonna smell
the sellout on me.

62
00:03:42,534 --> 00:03:43,957
Hey, how's it going?

63
00:03:44,119 --> 00:03:45,293
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

64
00:03:45,453 --> 00:03:46,628
- What's going on?
- Well...

65
00:03:46,788 --> 00:03:49,125
- I don't like this Michael.
- He doesn't like himself.

66
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:50,797
Or he'd pronounce it "Michael."

67
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,640
Isn't she great?
She's everything I love about America.

68
00:03:53,795 --> 00:03:56,974
Bold, opinionated, just past her peak...

69
00:03:57,132 --> 00:03:59,979
...and starting to realise
that she has to settle for less.

70
00:04:00,135 --> 00:04:03,148
And the moment she needs
a shoulder to cry on:

71
00:04:04,222 --> 00:04:06,274
- The Duncan handkerchief.
- Well, I'm out.

72
00:04:06,433 --> 00:04:11,238
Have fun circling my former lover,
waiting for her to cry.

73
00:04:11,396 --> 00:04:14,410
I tried to make that sound good,
but that's what you're doing.

74
00:04:17,194 --> 00:04:19,911
You're all heroes tonight
for making a difference...

75
00:04:20,071 --> 00:04:23,334
...but I want to introduce
one of my heroes.

76
00:04:23,742 --> 00:04:25,581
Britta Perry.

77
00:04:27,329 --> 00:04:29,085
She is the bravest...

78
00:04:29,247 --> 00:04:34,135
...most passionate activist
I have ever had the honour of imitating.

79
00:04:34,294 --> 00:04:36,762
So, hey, buy her a drink.

80
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,386
Anything you wanna add, Britta?

81
00:04:40,425 --> 00:04:46,393
I'm no hero. I'm a high-school dropout
and a bartender, so don't listen to me.

82
00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:49,440
Or anyone.

83
00:04:49,601 --> 00:04:51,736
Just listen to yourself...

84
00:04:51,895 --> 00:04:54,529
...and make sure
you tell yourself the truth.

85
00:04:56,566 --> 00:05:00,327
- Well, it was great seeing you, so...
- I might stay for one drink.

86
00:05:00,487 --> 00:05:02,741
- Why?
- I like to drink.

87
00:05:02,906 --> 00:05:05,243
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, I have a serious problem.

88
00:05:05,408 --> 00:05:07,129
That had better be true.

89
00:05:13,917 --> 00:05:15,969
Cool. Cool, cool, cool.

90
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,013
I am Kickpuncher.

91
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,316
You are in violation of future law.

92
00:05:40,235 --> 00:05:41,991
Damn it, come on.

93
00:05:45,824 --> 00:05:47,959
- What are you doing?
- What?

94
00:05:48,368 --> 00:05:49,791
What are you doing?

95
00:05:49,953 --> 00:05:53,417
Making a costume. Annie banned glue
guns after an incident so hilarious...

96
00:05:53,582 --> 00:05:56,085
...describing it would eclipse
what's happening here.

97
00:05:56,251 --> 00:05:59,430
- What's happening here?
- You and me bonding. Check it out.

98
00:06:02,674 --> 00:06:04,928
If you were
a post-apocalyptic survivor...

99
00:06:05,093 --> 00:06:08,190
I would raise goats, hoard cinnamon,
and travel only at night.

100
00:06:08,346 --> 00:06:10,980
But, please,
I have some work to do here.

101
00:06:11,141 --> 00:06:14,984
Just one thing. Watch this.
Initiate ballistic foam.

102
00:06:28,533 --> 00:06:30,040
- What the hell?
- Sorry.

103
00:06:30,202 --> 00:06:32,456
You just destroyed five hours of work.

104
00:06:32,621 --> 00:06:34,673
- I'll clean it up.
- No, you don't touch it.

105
00:06:39,044 --> 00:06:42,721
I know this is bad timing, but I should
go if I'm gonna make the movie, so...

106
00:06:45,383 --> 00:06:49,227
- What are you doing?
- Oh, something nobody ever does.

107
00:06:49,387 --> 00:06:51,024
Teaching you consequences.

108
00:06:53,058 --> 00:06:54,861
- But I have to go.
- But you can't.

109
00:06:55,018 --> 00:06:58,233
Isn't that crazy? You ever been
grounded? You ever been punished?

110
00:06:58,396 --> 00:07:01,493
Do you have any idea what it feels like
to be refused something?

111
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:04,330
I know what it feels like
when people try to control me.

112
00:07:04,486 --> 00:07:06,787
You should know
it never goes their way.

113
00:07:07,072 --> 00:07:09,658
And what Kickypunch movie
is that from?

114
00:07:09,825 --> 00:07:13,171
The ones you've seen,
or the one I'm gonna watch you miss?

115
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:22,259
I said I was sorry.

116
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:26,347
I'm sorry I punched my landlord,
but I'm not getting my deposit back.

117
00:07:26,508 --> 00:07:29,142
That's you being punished
for choosing to hurt someone.

118
00:07:29,302 --> 00:07:31,639
- I wrecked your papers by accident.
- You chose...

119
00:07:31,805 --> 00:07:34,902
...to spray this crap on purpose.
You didn't care what happened.

120
00:07:35,058 --> 00:07:37,063
I'll tell you something.
For five years...

121
00:07:37,227 --> 00:07:40,157
...I have watched people walk around
on your eggshells.

122
00:07:40,313 --> 00:07:43,243
"Oh, Abed.
He's so imaginative, so magical.

123
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,953
Everybody hide their hamburgers.

124
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:48,207
If Abed sees a hamburger,
we'll all travel in time.

125
00:07:48,363 --> 00:07:50,036
Let's eat cookies and ice cream...

126
00:07:50,198 --> 00:07:52,583
...and dress in pyjamas
in the middle of the day."

127
00:07:52,742 --> 00:07:55,839
I watched my third wife die.

128
00:07:58,456 --> 00:07:59,500
You think I'm spoiled?

129
00:08:00,292 --> 00:08:03,922
And you think I'm spoiled because it's
never occurred to anyone to do this?

130
00:08:04,087 --> 00:08:07,017
You're not Marco Polo
of bullying me, just another tourist...

131
00:08:07,174 --> 00:08:09,558
- ...taking pictures of a wall.
- Gonna make me cry.

132
00:08:09,718 --> 00:08:12,186
- Has someone physically limited you?
- Oh, just now.

133
00:08:12,345 --> 00:08:15,809
You physically ruined my drawings.

134
00:08:16,641 --> 00:08:18,481
Drawings of what?

135
00:08:20,103 --> 00:08:21,859
You're an artist?

136
00:08:23,231 --> 00:08:25,486
I destroyed something valuable?

137
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:31,201
Looked like you were
doodling chickens.

138
00:08:31,364 --> 00:08:32,752
He is a duck.

139
00:08:37,746 --> 00:08:41,708
Hey, you're not allowed in there.

140
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:44,556
Well, I just did a one-man show
for a little audience...

141
00:08:44,711 --> 00:08:47,843
- ...that would beg to disagree.
- Audience? In there?

142
00:08:48,006 --> 00:08:52,182
We haven't had a single person
or performance in that theatre...

143
00:08:52,344 --> 00:08:54,645
...since the 1997 fire.

144
00:08:54,804 --> 00:08:57,355
Twenty-four people died.

145
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:00,523
So, what have you guys been up to?

146
00:09:00,685 --> 00:09:03,615
This. Raising money, organising,
trying to make a difference.

147
00:09:03,772 --> 00:09:06,358
I'm impressed,
and embarrassed. I sold out.

148
00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:08,197
- We sold out.
- You did not sell out.

149
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,863
I'm going to community college
to start a career.

150
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:13,995
We're in real estate.
We own the building we're standing in.

151
00:09:14,449 --> 00:09:16,537
Wow, you guys did sell out.

152
00:09:16,701 --> 00:09:17,959
I know.

153
00:09:18,411 --> 00:09:20,582
I should introduce myself
to her friends and...

154
00:09:20,747 --> 00:09:23,428
I knew it.
You don't have a drinking problem.

155
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:26,217
You have feelings for Britta,
you disgusting monster.

156
00:09:26,378 --> 00:09:29,261
Fine, yes. Something about
everybody liking her turns me on.

157
00:09:29,422 --> 00:09:30,466
It's a problem I have.

158
00:09:30,632 --> 00:09:33,100
I hated Reese's Pieces
before E.T. ate them. Sorry.

159
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:36,059
- You're a bad friend.
- That's not fair.

160
00:09:36,221 --> 00:09:39,021
Wait, that's really not fair.
You're a terrible friend.

161
00:09:39,182 --> 00:09:40,393
She was mine first.

162
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:42,730
- Not like she belongs to anybody.
- Here we go.

163
00:09:42,894 --> 00:09:45,279
"Love isn't a game,"
say the guys that always win.

164
00:09:45,438 --> 00:09:49,069
Now you're gonna pull a Dane Cook in
one of those three movies he was in...

165
00:09:49,234 --> 00:09:51,488
...about Dane Cook
getting laid by accident.

166
00:09:51,653 --> 00:09:57,419
Only it's not a Dane Cook movie, Jeff,
because this time someone's watching.

167
00:09:57,576 --> 00:10:00,922
Me, your friend, British Jason Biggs.

168
00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:04,923
If you never call me Dane Cook
again, I'll stand down.

169
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:08,840
- For an hour.
- Okay, an hour.

170
00:10:12,841 --> 00:10:15,771
Are your drawings a secret?
You do them when nobody's around?

171
00:10:15,927 --> 00:10:19,771
Not that it's any of your business,
but I am a cartoonist in my spare time.

172
00:10:19,931 --> 00:10:22,779
My cartoon's about a duck.
I was drawing him.

173
00:10:22,934 --> 00:10:25,189
Does the duck have a name?
Does he have powers?

174
00:10:25,353 --> 00:10:27,275
I'm not pitching to you.

175
00:10:27,772 --> 00:10:29,825
- You're afraid I won't like it.
- Sure.

176
00:10:29,983 --> 00:10:34,622
Been a cab driver, soldier, a cop,
but what terrifies me the most...

177
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:37,745
...is the opinion of a man-child
in cardboard pants.

178
00:10:37,908 --> 00:10:40,328
Kickpuncher was a cop
before he became a cyborg.

179
00:10:40,494 --> 00:10:43,459
So you were a cop
before you became this.

180
00:10:43,622 --> 00:10:48,011
And what were you before this?
Were you normal?

181
00:10:48,168 --> 00:10:52,130
Or you act like this because somebody
stuffed you in a locker? Is that it?

182
00:10:52,297 --> 00:10:55,145
Other way around. What else
do you wanna know about me?

183
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,937
- Can you stop talking?
- Let me go.

184
00:10:57,093 --> 00:11:00,023
- After you missed your movie.
- Because you want me to suffer.

185
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,481
For destroying your duck cartoons?

186
00:11:02,641 --> 00:11:03,982
The ones you're ashamed of?

187
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:30,921
Which one were you laughing at?

188
00:11:33,004 --> 00:11:36,137
No, no, no, stop that! You're ghosts!

189
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:37,343
We're ghosts?

190
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:40,012
The janitor out there told me
you died in 1997.

191
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:42,518
Janitor?

192
00:11:44,224 --> 00:11:46,194
Hey, those guys in there told me...

193
00:11:46,351 --> 00:11:49,364
...that you're the one
that died in a fire, and you're a ghost.

194
00:11:49,521 --> 00:11:51,692
And you just believed them?

195
00:11:51,857 --> 00:11:55,487
You just believed a bunch of ghosts?

196
00:12:02,701 --> 00:12:05,204
Have you guys seen that billboard
on Water Street...

197
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,458
...for Consensual perfume?

198
00:12:07,622 --> 00:12:11,134
The man chasing the woman through
the grass, says, "Proven in its field."

199
00:12:11,293 --> 00:12:14,425
Yeah, proven in its field and in labs
on the eyeballs of rabbits.

200
00:12:14,588 --> 00:12:17,601
We should make it say that.
Who's got the spray paint?

201
00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:22,641
No, guys, I'm serious.
Doug and Janet, you're on lookout.

202
00:12:22,804 --> 00:12:26,067
Michael works the ladder.
I will Banksy that mother!

203
00:12:26,224 --> 00:12:28,728
Come on, guys,
we gotta start taking risks again.

204
00:12:28,894 --> 00:12:32,073
Oh, well, that's convenient
for the one with nothing to lose.

205
00:12:34,357 --> 00:12:38,747
Oh, so the person with the least wealth
has the least valid argument?

206
00:12:38,904 --> 00:12:39,947
That's convenient.

207
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:43,627
Britta, how many people have you fed
this year besides yourself?

208
00:12:43,783 --> 00:12:47,378
- Oh, Janet.
- No, I spent enough time feeling bad.

209
00:12:50,957 --> 00:12:53,045
Fight the power.

210
00:13:05,764 --> 00:13:07,983
- Would you like to go...?
- Yeah.

211
00:13:08,141 --> 00:13:11,320
Yeah? Oh, my God.

212
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,077
These are really good.

213
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:31,293
It helps me see why you were so upset.
I ruin anything as good as what's here?

214
00:13:31,456 --> 00:13:33,177
Just practice drawings.

215
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:36,133
I have to practise drawing the duck
from different angles.

216
00:13:36,294 --> 00:13:39,925
It's hard when his back's turned
three-quarters because of the beak.

217
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:44,896
- Well, I'm a real jerk for wrecking it.
- You didn't do it on purpose.

218
00:13:45,053 --> 00:13:47,390
- Doesn't excuse my behaviour.
- I appreciate that.

219
00:13:47,556 --> 00:13:49,643
It's a good apology. You're a good kid.

220
00:13:51,977 --> 00:13:53,318
All right.

221
00:13:53,478 --> 00:13:57,571
Well, I can see from the clock
that if I hit all the green lights, then...

222
00:13:57,732 --> 00:14:00,450
Sorry, can't let you go.
It'd undercut the larger lesson.

223
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:04,323
The lesson being you're very talented,
but I can't walk into a movie after...

224
00:14:04,489 --> 00:14:06,126
You're not going to the movie.

225
00:14:09,077 --> 00:14:10,121
Yes, I am.

226
00:14:10,287 --> 00:14:12,126
- You need this.
- Let me go.

227
00:14:12,289 --> 00:14:13,879
This is you learning.

228
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,010
You're a bad person
and a bad cartoonist.

229
00:14:16,168 --> 00:14:18,718
You go ahead. Hurt my feelings.

230
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,512
Your feelings? Considered
putting them into your work?

231
00:14:21,673 --> 00:14:23,844
Your cartoons are monuments
to joylessness...

232
00:14:24,009 --> 00:14:26,690
...jokes based on nothing
from your life or anyone's.

233
00:14:26,845 --> 00:14:28,815
You're furious at me for being creative.

234
00:14:28,972 --> 00:14:31,902
You wanna create. You have
this rage, shame and loneliness...

235
00:14:32,058 --> 00:14:35,072
...which I don't know how to feel,
and you put what on paper?

236
00:14:35,228 --> 00:14:38,776
Jim the Duck. I'm crazy? Something's
wrong with me? Jim the Duck?

237
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,408
- Publishers are interested!
- Publishers are stupid.

238
00:14:41,568 --> 00:14:43,869
That or you're
misinterpreting a form letter.

239
00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:45,072
- Shut up.
- You shut up.

240
00:14:45,238 --> 00:14:46,662
- You shut up.
- Are we yelling?

241
00:14:46,823 --> 00:14:50,667
- You're a self-centered, egotistical...
- I'm yelling, I'm yelling!

242
00:14:50,827 --> 00:14:53,591
And you're not talented!
You made me miss my movie!

243
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:59,254
You made me miss my movie.

244
00:15:11,306 --> 00:15:15,399
In the words of your hacky duck,
"What the hell?"

245
00:15:20,857 --> 00:15:22,743
Do you like music?

246
00:15:23,235 --> 00:15:26,034
Everyone likes music.
What are you, a fish?

247
00:15:26,196 --> 00:15:29,459
I have...
I tell you what we could listen to.

248
00:15:29,616 --> 00:15:32,250
Do you know Rimples and Splikket?

249
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:35,258
They were the British
Laurel and Hardy.

250
00:15:37,332 --> 00:15:38,886
Most of their stuff is timeless.

251
00:15:39,042 --> 00:15:42,174
But you do need to know that
the prime minister went to Oxford...

252
00:15:42,337 --> 00:15:45,267
...not Cambridge,
as the sketch implies.

253
00:15:45,423 --> 00:15:50,679
- Are they speaking English?
- Okay, '80s German techno it is.

254
00:15:52,055 --> 00:15:54,606
- Do you have any friends?
- Sorry?

255
00:15:54,766 --> 00:15:59,488
I've defined myself with reactions
to and from other people my whole life.

256
00:15:59,646 --> 00:16:04,071
Now I feel worthless just because I'm
worthless in relation to my friends...

257
00:16:04,234 --> 00:16:06,619
...which means they're not my friends.

258
00:16:06,778 --> 00:16:08,071
Who are your friends?

259
00:16:08,238 --> 00:16:09,792
Well, there's my neighbour, Pat.

260
00:16:09,948 --> 00:16:12,249
I try to stay on his good side.
I owe him money.

261
00:16:12,409 --> 00:16:16,039
There's Jeff. I'd call you a friend.
Well, in fact, I'd call you and Jeff...

262
00:16:16,204 --> 00:16:20,167
Right, you and Jeff have known
each other longer than anybody, huh?

263
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:24,046
I always forget that, I guess because
you guys don't really act like friends.

264
00:16:26,923 --> 00:16:30,471
Yeah, I guess not so much.

265
00:16:31,428 --> 00:16:32,816
Where are we going?

266
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:40,778
Well, I think you should go home...

267
00:16:40,937 --> 00:16:43,820
...because you're having
an existential crisis...

268
00:16:43,982 --> 00:16:46,782
...and the best lesson
you could take away from it...

269
00:16:46,943 --> 00:16:50,574
...is that you are someone,
even when you're by yourself.

270
00:16:51,031 --> 00:16:52,584
I think you're right. Thank you.

271
00:16:52,741 --> 00:16:56,703
And please don't take of fence at this,
but thank you for not hitting on me.

272
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:00,133
I was just vulnerable enough
to do something really stupid.

273
00:17:02,209 --> 00:17:05,507
- What's wrong?
- Nothing, nothing. It's nothing. The...

274
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:08,933
The stupid steering wheel
is on the wrong side of the car.

275
00:17:14,095 --> 00:17:16,681
- What are you doing here?
- I wanna show you something.

276
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,604
What's this?

277
00:17:22,854 --> 00:17:25,073
It's a script I wrote
about a cop on the edge.

278
00:17:25,232 --> 00:17:29,372
Troy thought it's hilarious. I don't have
the heart to tell him it wasn't a comedy.

279
00:17:29,528 --> 00:17:32,375
- Why give this to me?
- I know filmmaking tricks and tropes.

280
00:17:32,531 --> 00:17:35,627
But what I'm missing
is what the critics call substance...

281
00:17:35,784 --> 00:17:37,374
...which is you more than me.

282
00:17:37,536 --> 00:17:39,291
You wanna be film partners?

283
00:17:46,628 --> 00:17:50,721
"It's time for Justice. Police Justice."

284
00:17:50,882 --> 00:17:53,386
Wait, the character's name
is Police Justice?

285
00:17:54,344 --> 00:17:56,681
Yeah, I think I may be able to help.

286
00:17:57,389 --> 00:17:58,895
I'm sorry for the stuff I said.

287
00:18:01,935 --> 00:18:03,655
Me too.

288
00:18:03,812 --> 00:18:04,856
Sit down.

289
00:18:11,069 --> 00:18:12,243
You drink Scotch?

290
00:18:12,404 --> 00:18:14,243
- No.
- You're gonna.

291
00:18:16,575 --> 00:18:19,707
Hey, handsome. This stool taken?

292
00:18:20,245 --> 00:18:23,210
- Struck out, huh?
- If that makes you feel better.

293
00:18:23,373 --> 00:18:27,466
Or maybe I just realised
that I was spending the whole night...

294
00:18:27,627 --> 00:18:29,882
...getting to third base
with the wrong person.

295
00:18:32,257 --> 00:18:35,935
You're a good friend,
and I don't say that often enough.

296
00:18:36,094 --> 00:18:39,108
That's really nice.
But you can't have sex with me.

297
00:18:39,806 --> 00:18:41,609
How about we have these drinks...

298
00:18:41,766 --> 00:18:45,943
...and then not have sex with anyone
together?

299
00:18:46,104 --> 00:18:47,907
Sounds good.

300
00:18:48,607 --> 00:18:49,864
Cheers.

301
00:18:50,025 --> 00:18:52,196
A 9-millimetre's better than
a 10-millimetre?

302
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,575
Millimetre don't make no difference.
Bullets just kind of kill you.

303
00:18:55,739 --> 00:18:58,918
"Bullets just kind of kill you." Are you
quoting something? Can I use that?

304
00:18:59,117 --> 00:19:00,873
- Yeah.
- You left your handkerchief...

305
00:19:01,036 --> 00:19:02,293
...at my place last night.

306
00:19:02,454 --> 00:19:03,747
We had a boys' night.

307
00:19:03,914 --> 00:19:06,500
A bottle of booze,
an argument about sports cars...

308
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:09,680
...and I cut my hand trying to prove
that I can whittle.

309
00:19:09,836 --> 00:19:11,758
Me too.

310
00:19:12,964 --> 00:19:15,100
- Oh, hey. How was your night?
- Great.

311
00:19:15,258 --> 00:19:18,556
I had a monumental evening
by myself.

312
00:19:19,471 --> 00:19:21,108
I almost feel left out.

313
00:19:21,264 --> 00:19:23,945
Well, we've had our share
of focus lately.

314
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,144
Speak for yourself.

315
00:19:27,729 --> 00:19:29,900
I'm fine. I just...

316
00:19:30,982 --> 00:19:35,158
Do you guys believe in ghosts?
And if you do...

317
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,452
...do you believe what those ghosts
tell you about other ghosts?

318
00:19:38,615 --> 00:19:42,957
Chang, you cannot be on the committee
if you're going to be actively insane.

319
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:49,336
I'm not insane. I just had a weird
experience at the theatre last night.

320
00:19:49,501 --> 00:19:50,842
- You were there?
- You were?

321
00:19:51,002 --> 00:19:53,802
- What? Of course I was.
- I guess we just didn't see you.

322
00:19:56,341 --> 00:20:00,683
Well, the ants were people.
The queen ant was an oil company.

323
00:20:04,683 --> 00:20:06,189
What if I don't exist?

324
00:20:06,351 --> 00:20:09,982
Oh, I got this.
I had a very similar night last night.

325
00:20:10,147 --> 00:20:13,279
Go home, light some candles,
and take a bath.

326
00:20:13,441 --> 00:20:15,281
Okay, coolsies.

327
00:20:15,443 --> 00:20:18,872
- I don't know what I would do without...
- Just don't let anyone...

328
00:20:19,322 --> 00:20:21,327
All we have to do is...

329
00:20:43,805 --> 00:20:45,608
Hey, I was thinking off-campus lunch.

330
00:20:45,765 --> 00:20:47,652
What's that Tex-Mex place
you mentioned?

331
00:20:47,809 --> 00:20:49,861
Salsa Von Taco's? Read my mind.

332
00:20:53,565 --> 00:20:55,404
- No, no.
- Oh, no, no, no.

333
00:20:55,567 --> 00:20:56,860
No, no, no.

334
00:20:57,027 --> 00:20:58,664
- No.
- Okay, yeah.

335
00:20:59,571 --> 00:21:00,615
No. Well, let's go.

336
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,955
- No.
- No. Nothing for...

337
00:21:02,115 --> 00:21:03,159
Well... Okay.

338
00:21:03,325 --> 00:21:04,997
You just... Okay.

339
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,339
- I just don't like being left behind.
- Well... No, no, no.

340
00:21:08,497 --> 00:21:11,130
My father got drunk in pubs
and left me in my room!

341
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:14,055
- So did mine! So did mine!
- Why would he do that?

342
00:21:14,211 --> 00:21:15,468
Why do they do that?

343
00:21:15,629 --> 00:21:18,678
- Why?
- Why do they do that?

344
00:21:20,342 --> 00:21:22,596
I won't go to that Tex-Mex place.

345
00:21:22,761 --> 00:21:24,647
Oh, that's all I wanted you to say.

346
00:21:25,305 --> 00:21:31,588
