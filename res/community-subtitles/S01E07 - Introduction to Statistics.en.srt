3
00:02:30,084 --> 00:02:31,651
- the bernoulli distribution

4
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:33,050
Is the number of successes

5
00:02:33,117 --> 00:02:34,617
In a sequence of independent

6
00:02:34,684 --> 00:02:36,850
Yes-no experiments.

7
00:02:36,917 --> 00:02:38,217
Okay.

8
00:02:38,284 --> 00:02:39,351
Uh, for the quiz monday,

9
00:02:39,417 --> 00:02:45,117
Brush up on chapters
three and four.

10
00:02:45,184 --> 00:02:46,784
- bernoulli's
one of my favorites.

11
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,584
Little-known fact, statistics
were not his only love.

12
00:02:49,651 --> 00:02:51,084
He's also famous
for his french sauce

13
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,117
Used on meat and poultry.

14
00:02:52,184 --> 00:02:53,484
- that's bearnaise.

15
00:02:53,551 --> 00:02:55,250
- oh, we may need
to settle this at a restaurant.

16
00:02:55,317 --> 00:02:56,850
- it's cute.

17
00:02:56,917 --> 00:02:58,284
A little aggressive,

18
00:02:58,351 --> 00:03:00,150
But as a busy,
confident woman of authority,

19
00:03:00,217 --> 00:03:01,617
I'm attracted to men
who take charge.

20
00:03:01,684 --> 00:03:03,351
- are you being sarcastic,
or am i nailing it?

21
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,250
- you were nailing it,
until you had to ask.

22
00:03:05,317 --> 00:03:07,384
- oh, damn it.
starting over.

23
00:03:07,451 --> 00:03:08,850
Hey, you in the skirt,
date me.

24
00:03:08,917 --> 00:03:09,917
- i'd like to, mr. winger.

25
00:03:09,983 --> 00:03:11,050
You're tall,
you dress nice,

26
00:03:11,117 --> 00:03:12,384
And i've graded
enough of your tests

27
00:03:12,451 --> 00:03:14,084
To know i'd never feel
mentally inadequate.

28
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,217
- thank you.

29
00:03:15,284 --> 00:03:17,150
- only problem,
i don't date students.

30
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,017
- you know if you agree
to go out with me--

31
00:03:22,084 --> 00:03:23,017
Oh, hey.

32
00:03:23,084 --> 00:03:24,017
Awkward.

33
00:03:24,084 --> 00:03:25,217
How small is this campus?

34
00:03:25,284 --> 00:03:26,751
- bastard.

35
00:03:26,818 --> 00:03:28,451
- it's fine.
i don't care.

36
00:03:28,517 --> 00:03:29,883
- it's disgusting
the way men behave.

37
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,651
Did you ever see that
katherine heigl movie poster

38
00:03:31,718 --> 00:03:33,584
Where gerard butler had
that heart over his weiner?

39
00:03:33,651 --> 00:03:34,617
That resonated with me.

40
00:03:34,684 --> 00:03:35,617
- okay, fine.

41
00:03:35,684 --> 00:03:36,617
But just to repeat,

42
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:37,651
I don't care what jeff does.

43
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:38,617
- bastard.

44
00:03:38,684 --> 00:03:39,651
- i'm barely a student.

45
00:03:39,718 --> 00:03:40,651
I'm older than you.

46
00:03:40,718 --> 00:03:41,950
I drive a lexus.

47
00:03:42,017 --> 00:03:43,184
<i>i saw ghost busters
in the theater.</i>

48
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,684
Look, my gums are receding.

49
00:03:44,751 --> 00:03:47,451
- it's uncanny how many
of my buttons you're finding,

50
00:03:47,517 --> 00:03:49,651
But i have a personal rule
about this, and i stick to it.

51
00:03:49,718 --> 00:03:51,784
- have a cup of coffee with me.
i bet i can change your mind.

52
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,184
- oh, i know you can.

53
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,184
That's why you're not
getting the chance.

54
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:59,117
- ooh, whoo.

55
00:03:59,184 --> 00:04:01,584
<i>- are you coming to my
dias de los muertos party?</i>

56
00:04:01,651 --> 00:04:03,150
- i'm definitely
gonna try to swing by.

57
00:04:03,217 --> 00:04:05,117
- then i can mark you down
as definitely being there

58
00:04:05,184 --> 00:04:07,351
From 7:00 sharp till upside-down
spanish question mark?

59
00:04:07,417 --> 00:04:09,050
- here's the thing--
- no, here's the thing.

60
00:04:09,117 --> 00:04:10,651
I am putting my foot down.
you understand?

61
00:04:10,718 --> 00:04:12,617
I am being assertive,

62
00:04:12,684 --> 00:04:14,584
And i am making eye contact,

63
00:04:14,651 --> 00:04:16,484
And it is achieving results.

64
00:04:16,551 --> 00:04:17,850
- are you trying
to get formidable with me?

65
00:04:17,917 --> 00:04:18,917
- it worked on pierce.

66
00:04:18,983 --> 00:04:20,617
- infomercials work on pierce.

67
00:04:20,684 --> 00:04:23,751
- jeff,
you're the cool guy, okay?

68
00:04:23,818 --> 00:04:26,617
If you show up, it'll be
the first party i host

69
00:04:26,684 --> 00:04:27,950
Where everyone doesn't say

70
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:31,684
They need to get home in time
for the news.

71
00:04:31,751 --> 00:04:32,684
- this won't work.

72
00:04:32,751 --> 00:04:33,850
The last time you did this,

73
00:04:33,917 --> 00:04:35,217
I saved a vial of your tears

74
00:04:35,284 --> 00:04:36,983
And have been slowly
building up an immunity.

75
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,684
- i was so unpopular
in high school,

76
00:04:38,751 --> 00:04:41,250
The crossing guard
used to lure me into traffic.

77
00:04:41,317 --> 00:04:44,117
This party is a second chance

78
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:45,551
To be...

79
00:04:45,617 --> 00:04:47,150
Hip.

80
00:04:47,217 --> 00:04:49,584
Cool!

81
00:04:49,651 --> 00:04:52,417
Laidback!

82
00:04:52,484 --> 00:04:53,983
- look,
i will come to your party.

83
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,584
- thank you.

84
00:04:55,651 --> 00:04:57,451
I'm putting you down
for two bags of ice

85
00:04:57,517 --> 00:04:59,983
And a sleeve of paper cups.

86
00:05:14,084 --> 00:05:16,983
- taking a pill?

87
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,184
- yes, i am.
- xenolovaden.

88
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,850
My grandpa took that
when he was around your age.

89
00:05:20,917 --> 00:05:23,751
- fantastic.

90
00:05:23,818 --> 00:05:24,983
But by the time grandpa
got up in years,

91
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:26,517
His memory wasn't great.

92
00:05:26,584 --> 00:05:27,751
He'd mix the wrong pills.
you know how old people are?

93
00:05:27,818 --> 00:05:29,050
- heard stories about it,
yeah.

94
00:05:29,117 --> 00:05:30,284
- one time
he started hallucinating

95
00:05:30,351 --> 00:05:31,718
And ran down the street
with no pants on.

96
00:05:31,784 --> 00:05:33,551
Which in the gaza strip
is considered a real party foul,

97
00:05:33,617 --> 00:05:35,117
So you should probably
be careful--

98
00:05:35,184 --> 00:05:37,317
- look, i really
don't need your advice,

99
00:05:37,384 --> 00:05:39,484
And i'm not
your pantsless grandpa.

100
00:05:39,551 --> 00:05:42,917
- pantsless grandpa.

101
00:05:45,184 --> 00:05:46,351
<i>- hola!</i>

102
00:05:47,384 --> 00:05:48,718
Scary.

103
00:05:48,818 --> 00:05:51,317
Oh, cute! cute.

104
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:53,684
Oh, britta.

105
00:05:53,751 --> 00:05:55,050
You look adorable.

106
00:05:55,117 --> 00:05:56,184
- thank you.

107
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,850
I hate when women
use halloween

108
00:05:57,917 --> 00:05:59,484
As an excuse to dress up
like sluts, you know?

109
00:05:59,551 --> 00:06:02,250
- yeah.

110
00:06:02,317 --> 00:06:04,351
Okay, everyone.

111
00:06:04,417 --> 00:06:06,417
I think we can begin.

112
00:06:06,484 --> 00:06:09,417
I've got everyone's
personalized cookie tombstones,

113
00:06:09,484 --> 00:06:11,250
<i>por tradicion,</i>

114
00:06:11,317 --> 00:06:12,551
And in a few minutes,

115
00:06:12,617 --> 00:06:14,617
We're going to start
the dance of the dead--

116
00:06:14,684 --> 00:06:16,551
<i>la danza de los muertos.</i>

117
00:06:16,617 --> 00:06:18,084
- you don't have
to keep doing that!

118
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,651
- party on.

119
00:06:26,551 --> 00:06:27,883
- it's nice of you
to be here.

120
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,617
Sure you'd rather be out
with your hot professor.

121
00:06:29,684 --> 00:06:30,718
- well, it's funny,

122
00:06:30,784 --> 00:06:32,050
I enrolled here
as selfish loner,

123
00:06:32,117 --> 00:06:33,317
But you and the group
have given me

124
00:06:33,384 --> 00:06:34,651
A crash course
in friendship.

125
00:06:34,718 --> 00:06:36,317
- she blew you off, huh?
- she's grading papers.

126
00:06:36,384 --> 00:06:37,684
- professor slater?

127
00:06:37,751 --> 00:06:39,084
She's not grading papers.

128
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,718
She's at the faculty party
in the cafeteria.

129
00:06:40,784 --> 00:06:42,718
- oh, look, it's
the eavesdropping matador.

130
00:06:42,784 --> 00:06:45,617
- are you saying
my people are sneaky?

131
00:06:45,684 --> 00:06:47,017
- what?

132
00:06:47,084 --> 00:06:48,184
there's a storm

133
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,351
Building on the horizon,

134
00:06:49,417 --> 00:06:51,050
But you and i
will save the night.

135
00:06:51,117 --> 00:06:53,617
Chex mix,
pretzels, baby carrots,

136
00:06:53,684 --> 00:06:57,784
Predictable but appetizing.

137
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,117
 hey.
- hey.

138
00:06:59,184 --> 00:07:01,050
- can i ask you something
i always wanted to ask

139
00:07:01,117 --> 00:07:03,217
The real batman?
- yeah.

140
00:07:03,284 --> 00:07:04,484
- am i good looking?

141
00:07:04,551 --> 00:07:06,217
- you're a very attractive
young man.

142
00:07:06,284 --> 00:07:11,050
- i knew it.

143
00:07:11,117 --> 00:07:13,284
- let's get this party started!

144
00:07:13,351 --> 00:07:14,684
- who are you?

145
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:18,050
- i am the beastmaster.

146
00:07:18,117 --> 00:07:21,417
<i>from the movie beastmaster.</i>

147
00:07:21,484 --> 00:07:23,417
What rock
have you been living under?

148
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:24,917
What are you going as?

149
00:07:24,983 --> 00:07:26,917
A gay douchebag?
just kidding.

150
00:07:26,983 --> 00:07:28,818
- nice one.
i'm not much of a costume guy.

151
00:07:28,883 --> 00:07:30,050
- i know,
you're not much

152
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:31,584
Of a liking the ladies guy
either, huh?

153
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:36,217
Oop. body blow.
is that liquor?

154
00:07:36,284 --> 00:07:37,217
hello.

155
00:07:37,284 --> 00:07:38,284
Here's your drinks, mates.

156
00:07:38,351 --> 00:07:39,284
- oh, thanks, urkel.

157
00:07:39,351 --> 00:07:40,451
- i'm harry potter.

158
00:07:40,517 --> 00:07:41,617
- really?

159
00:07:41,684 --> 00:07:44,217
- what up, urkel?

160
00:07:52,751 --> 00:07:54,150
- hey.

161
00:07:54,217 --> 00:07:56,284
- oh...

162
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:58,484
- all right.
what are you taking?

163
00:07:59,983 --> 00:08:02,084
You know,
the usual cool stuff.

164
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,917
I've got 'ludes,
uh, dreamers...

165
00:08:04,983 --> 00:08:05,950
Johnny boys.

166
00:08:06,017 --> 00:08:06,950
- tell you what.

167
00:08:07,017 --> 00:08:08,684
I'll trade you one of mine

168
00:08:08,751 --> 00:08:10,651
For two of yours.
hmm?

169
00:08:10,718 --> 00:08:12,950
- i don't know, star-burns.
i'm--

170
00:08:13,017 --> 00:08:14,250
- oh, sorry.

171
00:08:14,317 --> 00:08:15,950
I thought i was
dealing with the beastmaster.

172
00:08:16,017 --> 00:08:19,718
- hey, hey,
who said you weren't?

173
00:08:19,784 --> 00:08:22,017
Saddle up, fruit pie.

174
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:24,384
- i don't mind if i do.
may i?

175
00:08:24,451 --> 00:08:27,217
- here. take this.

176
00:08:27,284 --> 00:08:29,484
Give anyone that shows up
their stupid credit.

177
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:30,651
- you going
to the faculty party?

178
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:31,684
Make me your plus one.

179
00:08:31,751 --> 00:08:32,850
- ah, give it up, winger.

180
00:08:32,917 --> 00:08:35,551
Professor slater
doesn't date students.

181
00:08:35,617 --> 00:08:38,551
Or married asians
who drive mopeds.

182
00:08:38,617 --> 00:08:41,317
- give you 20 bucks.

183
00:08:41,384 --> 00:08:43,484
- i'll bring the hog around.

184
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,217
- okay, it's time
for the dance of the dead.

185
00:08:58,284 --> 00:09:00,217
Everyone form a circle.

186
00:09:00,284 --> 00:09:03,150
Lights. music.

187
00:09:03,217 --> 00:09:06,718
- is it under genre
or on a specific playlist?

188
00:09:06,784 --> 00:09:08,818
- hey, uh, man?
what'd you slip me?

189
00:09:08,883 --> 00:09:12,150
I keep grinding my teeth,
and i want to kiss everybody.

190
00:09:12,217 --> 00:09:14,117
<i>- what'd you slip me, man?</i>

191
00:09:14,184 --> 00:09:16,883
My heart stopped racing,
and i can't pee.

192
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:19,050
- now for the first dance,

193
00:09:19,117 --> 00:09:22,217
I'd like to invite a very
special guest to the floor.

194
00:09:22,284 --> 00:09:24,517
Jeff winger?

195
00:09:28,384 --> 00:09:29,950
Jeff?

196
00:09:30,017 --> 00:09:31,351
Where's jeff?

197
00:09:38,451 --> 00:09:40,451
- is jeff gone?

198
00:09:41,484 --> 00:09:43,284
You know, i'm gonna go.

199
00:09:43,351 --> 00:09:44,384
I don't want to miss the news.

200
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:45,683
- news!

201
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,151
- he just stepped out.

202
00:09:48,217 --> 00:09:51,884
He's gonna be right back.

203
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:54,584
He's going
to the faculty party.

204
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,050
- to be with
professor short skirt?

205
00:09:56,117 --> 00:09:57,284
We hate her.

206
00:09:57,351 --> 00:09:59,451
- no, it's not
about her, shirley.

207
00:09:59,518 --> 00:10:01,417
I can't believe that
jeff would do this to annie.

208
00:10:01,484 --> 00:10:03,484
- yes, absolutely.
it's about annie.

209
00:10:03,551 --> 00:10:05,151
We should go
find that bitch's car

210
00:10:05,217 --> 00:10:08,351
And snap off her antenna.

211
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:10,251
- it's like high school
all over again.

212
00:10:10,317 --> 00:10:12,783
Everyone's leaving.

213
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,518
- not me.

214
00:10:14,584 --> 00:10:17,618
I could do this all night.

215
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,434
- there you go, pretty lady.

216
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,267
- what are you doing here?

217
00:10:30,334 --> 00:10:32,000
- showing you
my non-student side.

218
00:10:32,067 --> 00:10:33,867
- i have to admit,
this outfit's doing it for me.

219
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:35,467
I may or may not
have been deflowered

220
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:36,900
By a junior rodeo champion.

221
00:10:36,967 --> 00:10:38,634
- you're reminding me
of my first time too.

222
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,534
- you lost your virginity
to robin hood?

223
00:10:40,601 --> 00:10:42,334
- no, with an
attractive woman at a party.

224
00:10:42,401 --> 00:10:44,134
We seem destined
to repeat history.

225
00:10:44,201 --> 00:10:46,000
- i told you no students.
it's unseemly.

226
00:10:46,067 --> 00:10:47,601
I go out with you,
you tell your friends,

227
00:10:47,668 --> 00:10:49,234
It gets around the school--
- what friends?

228
00:10:49,301 --> 00:10:50,334
I have no friends.

229
00:10:50,401 --> 00:10:51,934
I hate everyone here
but you.

230
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,234
- hey.

231
00:10:53,301 --> 00:10:54,401
- what are you doing here?

232
00:10:54,467 --> 00:10:55,767
<i>- what are you doing here?</i>

233
00:10:55,867 --> 00:10:57,401
You should be over
at the library with annie...

234
00:10:57,467 --> 00:10:58,934
Whoa.

235
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,534
Yippy ki yay.

236
00:11:01,601 --> 00:11:02,934
Thought you
weren't a costume guy.

237
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,267
- you had to have one
to get in here, squirrel.

238
00:11:04,334 --> 00:11:05,800
- oh, so where did you get it?

239
00:11:05,867 --> 00:11:07,534
'cause i wouldn't think
that any costume stores

240
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:08,800
Would be open this late.

241
00:11:08,867 --> 00:11:10,767
- i don't know
what you're getting at.

242
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,167
- i think the words
that you're looking for

243
00:11:12,234 --> 00:11:13,601
Are "i own a cowboy outfit."

244
00:11:13,668 --> 00:11:16,134
And it is tight too.
did you buy it like that?

245
00:11:16,201 --> 00:11:18,201
Your toy gun to my head,
i'd say yes.

246
00:11:18,267 --> 00:11:20,100
- hi.
michelle slater, ph.d.

247
00:11:20,167 --> 00:11:21,534
- britta perry, g.e.d.

248
00:11:21,601 --> 00:11:23,134
- oh, are you
a classmate of jeff's?

249
00:11:23,201 --> 00:11:24,568
- oh, well,
when you say "classmate,"

250
00:11:24,634 --> 00:11:26,467
It sounds like we take naps
together and eat paste,

251
00:11:26,534 --> 00:11:28,301
But what's great
about community colleges

252
00:11:28,367 --> 00:11:29,900
Is that a lot of the students

253
00:11:29,967 --> 00:11:31,568
Are just as mature
as the teachers.

254
00:11:31,634 --> 00:11:33,934
- jeff, you must return
to annie's party.

255
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,434
She's feeling unpopular.

256
00:11:35,501 --> 00:11:38,367
- jeff, pierce took something,
and he is tripping balls.

257
00:11:38,434 --> 00:11:40,534
He is touching people
and dancing weird.

258
00:11:40,601 --> 00:11:42,568
<i>it's like grumpy old men
but not hilarious.</i>

259
00:11:42,634 --> 00:11:44,367
- okay, uh, guys?

260
00:11:44,434 --> 00:11:46,867
I'm at a grownup
halloween party, all right?

261
00:11:46,934 --> 00:11:48,334
You're all being unseemly.

262
00:11:48,401 --> 00:11:50,700
- oh, no.
- how are we unseemly?

263
00:11:50,767 --> 00:11:53,267
- why is urkel
ripping the antenna

264
00:11:53,334 --> 00:11:54,934
Off professor slater's car?

265
00:11:56,201 --> 00:11:58,067
That's right,
professor slim calves.

266
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:02,134
This is what you get when you
steal jeff from a good woman!

267
00:12:05,034 --> 00:12:06,767
- no, abed!

268
00:12:16,034 --> 00:12:18,934
- is he meowing?
- yeah.

269
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,301
- enough.
i want you guys out of here.

270
00:12:21,367 --> 00:12:23,501
Britta, i don't care about
your high school soap opera.

271
00:12:23,568 --> 00:12:27,067
Abed, you're not batman.

272
00:12:27,134 --> 00:12:28,867
- pierce. pierce. pierce.

273
00:12:28,934 --> 00:12:31,401
Stop grinding on
the women's studies department.

274
00:12:31,467 --> 00:12:33,800
You are too old
to be tripping.

275
00:12:33,867 --> 00:12:36,067
- i'm old?

276
00:12:36,134 --> 00:12:39,833
What do you mean old?

277
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,301
Whose hands are these?

278
00:12:45,867 --> 00:12:46,833
Help me!

279
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,167
- way to go.

280
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:49,767
- i know i'm not batman.

281
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,967
You could try
not being a jerk.

282
00:12:52,034 --> 00:12:56,034
- she's pretty hot.

283
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,568
- well, where were we,
little doggie?

284
00:12:59,634 --> 00:13:02,833
- unseemly.
- yeah. crap.

285
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,434
- shirley?

286
00:13:13,067 --> 00:13:14,833
- shirley!

287
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,367
- this is professor
robin hood's office.

288
00:13:16,434 --> 00:13:17,800
- so what are you doing?

289
00:13:17,867 --> 00:13:19,134
- i'm putting this hose
in her desk,

290
00:13:19,201 --> 00:13:20,334
And you going outside
to turn the water on.

291
00:13:20,401 --> 00:13:21,767
- why?

292
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:24,267
- to teach that long-neck
weave-having bank teller

293
00:13:24,334 --> 00:13:25,367
She can't steal
another woman's man!

294
00:13:25,434 --> 00:13:27,267
That's why.

295
00:13:31,467 --> 00:13:34,134
I have a confession to make.

296
00:13:34,201 --> 00:13:35,534
I think
some of what i just said

297
00:13:35,601 --> 00:13:37,534
May have more to do
with my situation.

298
00:13:37,601 --> 00:13:39,367
- yeah, the long-neck,
weave-having bank teller

299
00:13:39,434 --> 00:13:41,434
Didn't feel universal.

300
00:13:41,501 --> 00:13:43,900
- my ex-husband
came by this morning,

301
00:13:43,967 --> 00:13:47,201
And he, uh, he asked
for his ring back.

302
00:13:47,267 --> 00:13:48,467
It was his mother's,

303
00:13:48,534 --> 00:13:51,167
And he wants to give it
to his new girlfriend.

304
00:13:51,234 --> 00:13:53,134
- shirley, that sucks.

305
00:13:53,201 --> 00:13:54,434
- don't get me wrong.

306
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,234
Best thing ever happened to me
was him leaving.

307
00:13:56,301 --> 00:13:59,100
I just--i always thought
he'd come crawling back,

308
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:03,267
And i'd get to tell him,
"go to hell."

309
00:14:03,334 --> 00:14:04,733
He couldn't even give me that.

310
00:14:06,601 --> 00:14:08,833
You know what
the crazy thing is, britta?

311
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:12,467
- everything
you've done tonight?

312
00:14:12,534 --> 00:14:15,434
- it's like i was too proud
to admit i was hurt,

313
00:14:15,501 --> 00:14:17,668
So i had to pretend
that you were.

314
00:14:17,733 --> 00:14:20,234
- i totally get that.

315
00:14:20,301 --> 00:14:23,100
- i feel better now.

316
00:14:23,167 --> 00:14:24,934
- let's go check on annie.

317
00:14:29,367 --> 00:14:31,867
Can you believe
i targeted this poor lady?

318
00:14:31,934 --> 00:14:33,900
Look at all these awards.

319
00:14:33,967 --> 00:14:35,568
I bet she's nice.

320
00:14:35,634 --> 00:14:37,733
- yeah.

321
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,367
Nice and pretentious.

322
00:14:48,134 --> 00:14:49,067
- pierce?

323
00:14:49,134 --> 00:14:52,668
Pierce, are you okay?

324
00:14:52,733 --> 00:14:54,934
- hey, man,
what's going on?

325
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,401
You have a full-on erection.

326
00:14:57,467 --> 00:14:59,134
Just rela--
just relax.

327
00:14:59,201 --> 00:15:02,934
- pierce, relax.
just relax, okay?

328
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,501
Pierce!

329
00:15:04,568 --> 00:15:09,134
- you are too old
to be tripping!

330
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:11,700
- pierce...

331
00:15:11,767 --> 00:15:14,334
- you are too old
to be tripping.

332
00:15:14,401 --> 00:15:17,000
- tell me about
the beatles, pierce.

333
00:15:17,067 --> 00:15:21,967
Tell me about woodstock
and sputnik, pierce.

334
00:15:33,434 --> 00:15:35,267
- gee,
do i feel a breeze here?

335
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,268
Because someone
just struck out.

336
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,500
- she blew you off too, chang.

337
00:15:39,567 --> 00:15:40,934
- is that what you
had to fall back on?

338
00:15:41,001 --> 00:15:43,300
Look at me, bro.
look at me.

339
00:15:43,367 --> 00:15:45,901
I've got the body
of a fifth grader, okay?

340
00:15:45,967 --> 00:15:47,534
If i was working
with what you've got,

341
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,433
She'd be at
the comfort inn right now

342
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,667
Giving me
a mexican halloween.

343
00:15:50,734 --> 00:15:51,667
- it's this campus.

344
00:15:51,734 --> 00:15:53,333
It feeds on my coolness.

345
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,667
I--i got no moves anymore.

346
00:15:54,734 --> 00:15:56,101
- moves?

347
00:15:56,168 --> 00:15:58,367
Everything's a game
to guys like you.

348
00:15:58,433 --> 00:16:02,034
I know one move i bet
you've never tried in your life.

349
00:16:02,101 --> 00:16:03,834
- what is it?

350
00:16:12,934 --> 00:16:15,300
Please sleep with me.
please.

351
00:16:15,367 --> 00:16:17,534
Pretty please.
i'm so lonely.

352
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,867
I haven't slept with anyone
in a very long time,

353
00:16:19,934 --> 00:16:21,134
And you are so good looking.

354
00:16:21,201 --> 00:16:23,834
Please do me the favor
of having sex with me.

355
00:16:28,567 --> 00:16:30,467
- okay,
stay three steps behind

356
00:16:30,534 --> 00:16:31,867
And promise
you won't tell anybody.

357
00:16:31,934 --> 00:16:33,767
- i promise.

358
00:16:33,834 --> 00:16:34,934
I promise.

359
00:16:47,367 --> 00:16:50,234
- everybody,
stay out of the library.

360
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,967
- pierce, it's okay.
come out of there.

361
00:16:53,034 --> 00:16:54,934
- no, i'm not ready to die!

362
00:16:55,001 --> 00:16:56,867
- pierce,
you're not gonna die!

363
00:16:56,934 --> 00:16:58,901
- just--just keep walking.
don't make eye contact.

364
00:16:58,967 --> 00:17:01,400
- jeff. jeff! jeff.

365
00:17:01,467 --> 00:17:02,600
Pierce is freaking out.

366
00:17:02,667 --> 00:17:04,134
You're the only one
that can help.

367
00:17:04,201 --> 00:17:05,300
- what makes you think that?

368
00:17:05,367 --> 00:17:06,467
- is jeff out there?

369
00:17:06,534 --> 00:17:07,700
He's the only one
who can help.

370
00:17:07,767 --> 00:17:09,433
- he says
he's gonna kill himself,

371
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,767
But he doesn't
want us to call 911,

372
00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:12,467
Because he doesn't want
to get in trouble

373
00:17:12,534 --> 00:17:13,834
For taking drugs.

374
00:17:16,634 --> 00:17:20,801
- i can't believe
i'm doing this.

375
00:17:20,867 --> 00:17:24,067
I, uh...

376
00:17:24,134 --> 00:17:27,433
I think
i have to say goodnight.

377
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,067
- are you, like,
a court-appointed guardian

378
00:17:29,134 --> 00:17:30,067
For these people?

379
00:17:30,134 --> 00:17:32,234
- uh, no.

380
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,901
Um, they're my classmates.

381
00:17:34,967 --> 00:17:37,134
- goodnight, jeff.

382
00:17:42,567 --> 00:17:45,168
- loser!

383
00:17:53,134 --> 00:17:55,901
- what in the pink floyd?

384
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,634
- i'm gonna
crush myself to death

385
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,767
With desks and tables, jeff!

386
00:17:59,834 --> 00:18:02,201
- is that a death
befitting a beastmaster?

387
00:18:02,268 --> 00:18:04,067
<i>- i never saw beastmaster.</i>

388
00:18:04,134 --> 00:18:05,500
I just wanted to be cool.

389
00:18:05,567 --> 00:18:08,433
- i'm coming in there, pierce.

390
00:18:16,101 --> 00:18:18,500
- those floating
mexican skeletons were right.

391
00:18:18,567 --> 00:18:19,767
My life is over.

392
00:18:19,834 --> 00:18:23,268
- well, when we go
to floating skeletons

393
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:24,734
With our problems,

394
00:18:24,801 --> 00:18:28,067
We get what we pay for,
don't we?

395
00:18:28,168 --> 00:18:31,467
- i'm old, jeff.

396
00:18:31,534 --> 00:18:34,201
- pierce, i don't know how
you spent the first 60 years,

397
00:18:34,268 --> 00:18:36,767
But i know
in the last two months

398
00:18:36,834 --> 00:18:38,867
You've probably doubled
the national average

399
00:18:38,934 --> 00:18:42,067
For amount of life lived
per lifetime.

400
00:18:42,134 --> 00:18:45,700
- well, i do have a young,
african-american friend.

401
00:18:45,767 --> 00:18:47,067
- yeah.

402
00:18:47,134 --> 00:18:48,400
And, more importantly,

403
00:18:48,467 --> 00:18:50,168
You're dressed
like a gladiator

404
00:18:50,234 --> 00:18:52,600
In a desk fort that you built
during a bad trip.

405
00:18:52,667 --> 00:18:55,400
If life is just a series
of ridiculous attempts

406
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,901
To be alive,

407
00:18:56,967 --> 00:18:58,700
You're a hero

408
00:18:58,767 --> 00:19:00,634
To everything
that's ever lived.

409
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,367
- yeah?

410
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:03,367
- yeah.

411
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,634
- yeah!

412
00:19:24,867 --> 00:19:28,400
- batman?
yeah?

413
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,001
- are you staying
for the party?

414
00:19:31,067 --> 00:19:32,667
- if i stay,

415
00:19:32,734 --> 00:19:36,201
There can be no party.

416
00:19:36,268 --> 00:19:39,001
I must be out there
in the night,

417
00:19:39,067 --> 00:19:41,867
Staying vigilant.

418
00:19:41,934 --> 00:19:43,734
Wherever a party
needs to be saved,

419
00:19:43,801 --> 00:19:45,467
I'm there.

420
00:19:45,534 --> 00:19:47,767
Wherever there are masks,

421
00:19:47,834 --> 00:19:49,867
Wherever there's
tomfoolery and joy,

422
00:19:49,934 --> 00:19:53,500
I'm there.

423
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,101
But sometimes i'm not,

424
00:19:55,168 --> 00:19:56,168
'cause i'm out in the night,

425
00:19:56,234 --> 00:19:58,268
Staying vigilant, watching,

426
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:01,300
Lurking, running, jumping,

427
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,967
Hurtling, sleeping...

428
00:20:04,034 --> 00:20:05,567
No, i can't sleep.

429
00:20:05,634 --> 00:20:07,400
You sleep.
i'm awake.

430
00:20:07,467 --> 00:20:09,500
I don't sleep.
i don't blink.

431
00:20:10,734 --> 00:20:11,567
Am i a bird?
no.

432
00:20:11,634 --> 00:20:14,101
I'm a bat.

433
00:20:14,168 --> 00:20:16,700
I am batman.

434
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:19,433
Or am i?

435
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,867
Yes, i am batman.

436
00:20:23,934 --> 00:20:25,367
Happy halloween.

437
00:20:30,201 --> 00:20:31,433
- I'm Batman.
- You sound like cookie monster.

438
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,001
- i'm batman.
- that's batman.

439
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:36,567
- candy corn looks like
tiny traffic cones.

440
00:20:36,634 --> 00:20:38,268
- yeah, it sure does.

441
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,001
- at, like,
a candy traffic school.

442
00:20:41,433 --> 00:20:43,367
- like, a little
gingerbread man at the wheel,

443
00:20:43,433 --> 00:20:44,400
And he's drunk.

444
00:20:44,467 --> 00:20:45,400
- look out.

445
00:20:45,467 --> 00:20:46,700
- you'd be driving,

446
00:20:46,767 --> 00:20:48,500
But you keep wanting
to eat yourself.

447
00:20:48,567 --> 00:20:49,834
- all day.

448
00:20:49,901 --> 00:20:51,168
- that's one
of my biggest fears.

449
00:20:51,234 --> 00:20:52,400
- what is?

450
00:20:52,467 --> 00:20:54,234
- if i ever,
like, woke up as a donut.

451
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,201
- you would eat yourself?

452
00:20:55,268 --> 00:20:56,767
- i wouldn't even question it.

453
00:20:56,834 --> 00:20:57,901
that'd be tasty.

454
00:20:57,967 --> 00:21:00,433
- it's cool to know
other people

455
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,034
Think about this stuff too.

456
00:21:02,101 --> 00:21:04,901
- yeah.

457
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:11,785
