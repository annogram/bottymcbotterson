<i>Welcome students, new and old,</i>
<i>to another fall semester at Greendale.</i>

9
00:00:48,194 --> 00:00:50,923
<i>It's time for clean slates</i>
<i>and fresh starts.</i>

10
00:00:51,831 --> 00:00:53,822
<i>Celebrate your fresh start tonight</i>

11
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:56,831
<i>at the Fresh-Start Dance</i>
<i>in the cafeteria.</i>

12
00:00:57,036 --> 00:01:01,131
<i>The same cafeteria where Britta Perry,</i>
<i>publicly professed her love to Jeff Winger</i>

13
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,069

<i>tonight, at the Fresh-Start Dance.</i>

16
00:01:10,016 --> 00:01:13,007
Look at us, living together,
driving to school together.

17
00:01:13,066 --> 00:01:15,659
I know, we're like Batman and Shaft.

18
00:01:16,021 --> 00:01:18,489
Batman actually had a guy.
His name was Robin.

19
00:01:18,691 --> 00:01:19,987
He rode around with him.

20
00:01:20,192 --> 00:01:22,718
Troy, Batman's friend
didn't have to be Robin,

21
00:01:22,742 --> 00:01:26,472
he could have been Shaft, Dolemite,
Leroy Brown.

22
00:01:26,865 --> 00:01:29,231
Don't let society limit your people.

23
00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:34,397
"Batman and Shaft", wow.
You're reading Troy's Twitter's page where

24
00:01:34,406 --> 00:01:38,472
- he posts everything Pierce says?
- Yeah, "Old white man says"?  It's hilarious.

25
00:01:40,146 --> 00:01:42,045
Hey.
Hello, Annie.

26
00:01:42,247 --> 00:01:44,112
I like your hair.
Thank you, Abed.

27
00:01:44,348 --> 00:01:46,442
- You're welcome.
- Oh, Jeffrey. Hello.

28
00:01:46,555 --> 00:01:48,879
Hey! how was your summer?
I live with you.

29
00:01:48,954 --> 00:01:51,048
- How was your summer?
- Great. How are you doing?

30
00:01:51,257 --> 00:01:53,521
- Oh, okay.
- Hey.

31
00:01:54,793 --> 00:01:56,694
- It's good to be back here.
- I know.

32
00:01:56,896 --> 00:01:58,260
Okay.

33
00:01:58,463 --> 00:02:01,996
So... are you guys ready
for whatever <i>Anthropology</i> is?

34
00:02:02,034 --> 00:02:03,296
We should wait for Britta.

35
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:07,147
Do we know she's coming back?
She never returned any of my calls or e-mails.

36
00:02:07,358 --> 00:02:08,792
Me neither.

37
00:02:09,241 --> 00:02:11,608
It's not gonna be the same
without her.

38
00:02:14,646 --> 00:02:16,405
Hey, did you guys see <i>Toy Story 3?</i>

39
00:02:16,414 --> 00:02:18,406
- Yes.
- Oh, I loved <i>Toy Story 3.</i>

40
00:02:18,617 --> 00:02:20,586
- It was amazing, I love...
- Hey!

41
00:02:20,712 --> 00:02:22,180
- Whoa!
- Oh!

42
00:02:22,454 --> 00:02:25,913
- Hey, <i>Toy Story...</i> Britta.
- How's it going?

43
00:02:26,158 --> 00:02:29,820
Okay, yeah, yeah. I made an ass
of myself and Jeff at that dance.

44
00:02:29,947 --> 00:02:33,375
I was caught up in a competition
with his turd of an ex-girlfriend,

45
00:02:33,432 --> 00:02:35,706
and I wish I could erase
the entire night.

46
00:02:35,706 --> 00:02:38,496
- And I owe you an apology.
- I accept.

47
00:02:38,497 --> 00:02:42,192
Oh, sweetie, you don't owe us anything
and you don't have to hide from us.

48
00:02:42,233 --> 00:02:46,300
You? I'm hiding from them.
It's like high school all over again.

49
00:02:46,611 --> 00:02:48,739
Psycho Britta,
the walking freak show

50
00:02:48,948 --> 00:02:51,174
for every Barbie
with a <i>Cosmo</i> subscription.

51
00:02:51,175 --> 00:02:56,211
Look, I don't mean to be a tool, but you
embarrassed me that night too, so call it karma.

52
00:02:56,989 --> 00:03:00,587
Wow, boy, I hope I'm not around
when you do mean to be a tool.

53
00:03:00,725 --> 00:03:04,287
Let's just put this behind us
and just walk to class, okay?

54
00:03:04,864 --> 00:03:06,354
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

55
00:03:09,634 --> 00:03:12,263
- You're Britta Perry?
- Yeah, what's it to you?

56
00:03:12,504 --> 00:03:14,973
You're the coolest.

57
00:03:15,206 --> 00:03:16,605
Right. Um...

58
00:03:16,808 --> 00:03:18,002
At what exactly?

59
00:03:18,243 --> 00:03:22,009
Being fearless, honest,
speaking from your heart.

60
00:03:22,213 --> 00:03:25,650
- "Jeff Winger, I love you".
- Right.

61
00:03:25,884 --> 00:03:28,615
- My heart may have overstated...
- Do you sign stuff?

62
00:03:28,735 --> 00:03:30,225
- Now and again.
- Awesome.

63
00:03:30,367 --> 00:03:32,301
I don't like where that's going.

64
00:03:32,692 --> 00:03:34,489
I know, right?

65
00:03:35,627 --> 00:03:37,323
Look...

66
00:03:38,396 --> 00:03:41,365
uhm, remember the little talk we had?

67
00:03:41,634 --> 00:03:44,069
The one about discretion?
Yes. Stop that.

68
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,902
Look, uhm, we agreed you and I kissing
was a mistake.

69
00:03:47,006 --> 00:03:50,168
And, if anyone were to find out about it,
I would be tarred, feathered,

70
00:03:50,259 --> 00:03:53,387
and put on one of those websites
people check when buying a house.

71
00:03:53,425 --> 00:03:57,021
It's forgotten, Jeff.
Jeez, I'm not some love-struck teenybopper.

72
00:03:57,515 --> 00:03:59,706
But you should know, we didn't just kiss,
we technically frenched.

73
00:03:59,718 --> 00:04:02,915
I checked the make-out meter
in this month's issue of...

74
00:04:03,155 --> 00:04:05,213
<i>National Review.</i>

75
00:04:09,395 --> 00:04:11,225
I don't like where that's going.

Señor Chang. Oh, wait,
I guess it's not señor anymore.

79
00:04:44,596 --> 00:04:46,656
What should we call you?
Student Chang?

80
00:04:46,865 --> 00:04:48,298
Two-credits-into-
a-music-major Chang?

81
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,264
Ok, how about not calling me anything?

82
00:04:51,504 --> 00:04:54,473
Why are you guys in this class?
We chose it together.

83
00:04:54,706 --> 00:04:56,937
The real question is,
why are you in it?

84
00:04:57,143 --> 00:04:59,470
- Oh, you missed us?
- Oh!

85
00:04:59,512 --> 00:05:02,970
Don't flatter yourself. Ok, have you
checked out the course description?

86
00:05:03,021 --> 00:05:08,084
Ancient weaponry? Genital mutilation?
This subject's talking my Chang-uage.

87
00:05:08,521 --> 00:05:09,713
Ugh.

88
00:05:18,596 --> 00:05:19,620
I don't get it.

89
00:05:19,831 --> 00:05:22,625
Well, Star-Burns has grown reliant
on his star-shaped sideburns,

90
00:05:22,634 --> 00:05:25,401
but still craves identity beyond them,
so he added a hat.

91
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:28,755
No, what's up with Britta-mania?
Oh, that's even simpler.

92
00:05:29,007 --> 00:05:32,137
In the eyes of the public, Britta put herself out there
and you walked away,

93
00:05:32,177 --> 00:05:34,271
making her the underdog,
the GLT, the Aniston.

94
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,343
- That's ridiculous.
- Yeah.

95
00:05:36,343 --> 00:05:38,975
Hey Jeff, do you have any hillbilly cousins?
I wish, why?

96
00:05:39,055 --> 00:05:42,321
What about a wealthy uncle, or and old drinking buddy,
that may or may not have had a sex change?

97
00:05:42,569 --> 00:05:45,509
Abed, why are you mining my life
for sitcom scenarios?

98
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,036
I guess I'm just excited about the new year,
looking for ways to improve things.

99
00:05:48,067 --> 00:05:50,151
I'm hoping we can move away
from the soapy relationship-y stuff,

100
00:05:50,154 --> 00:05:52,879
and into bigger fast-paced,
self-contained escapades.

101
00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:57,079
What is it exactly that separates man
from animal?

102
00:05:57,369 --> 00:05:58,596
Divorce?

103
00:06:09,714 --> 00:06:13,014
Tools. Like this blowgun I used
to hunt monkeys

104
00:06:13,218 --> 00:06:15,016
with the Korubo in the Amazon.

105
00:06:15,687 --> 00:06:17,622
My name is Professor June Bauer,

106
00:06:17,856 --> 00:06:22,084
and this semester I will guide you
to the very threshold of your humanity,

107
00:06:22,161 --> 00:06:25,653
where you will lock eyes
with the shrieking, blood-drenched,

108
00:06:25,865 --> 00:06:29,665
sister-raping beasts
from which we sprang.

109
00:06:29,869 --> 00:06:31,995
You will also have to
make a diorama.

110
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,519
For your first assignment,
I would like you to form tribes

111
00:06:36,675 --> 00:06:41,134
of no more than eight,
and if you can, mix up the races.

112
00:06:41,346 --> 00:06:44,338
Or you'll be surprised
at how quickly things get awkward.

113
00:06:47,418 --> 00:06:50,521
You know, now that Troy's off the streets
and living with me,

114
00:06:50,521 --> 00:06:52,487
he's learning so much about the world.

115
00:06:52,524 --> 00:06:55,516
Yeah. Tell me again
why Jewish people wear yarmulkes.

116
00:06:55,761 --> 00:06:57,887
Half a hat, saves money.

117
00:06:58,463 --> 00:07:00,158
Thank you.

118
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:03,697
"Half a hat"? That is so offensive.

119
00:07:03,903 --> 00:07:05,733
I love <i>Old White Man Says </i>.

120
00:07:05,937 --> 00:07:08,470
Hey, find an eighth dork
for your tribe of dorks?

121
00:07:08,473 --> 00:07:10,608
Chang, I'm starting to think
you took Anthropology,

122
00:07:10,608 --> 00:07:13,401
because you wanna be in our group,
but are too proud to ask.

123
00:07:13,403 --> 00:07:14,997
What?!
Keep dreaming, Winger.

124
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:18,577
Would somebody with
too much pride... do this?

125
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:22,050
<i>Current balance: $23.20.</i>

126
00:07:22,254 --> 00:07:24,915
Consider yourself Chang'd.

127
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:27,853
Mac and cheese, please.

128
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,757
Sorry, looks like your food
just walked out on you.

129
00:07:31,997 --> 00:07:33,759
Same way you did Britta.

130
00:07:39,805 --> 00:07:41,738
Hey, can we talk?

131
00:07:41,973 --> 00:07:46,069
Oh, now he wants to talk.
No, it's fine, I'll be right back.

132
00:07:47,312 --> 00:07:51,615
Man, you got some real passionate fans.
Eh. It'll blow over.

133
00:07:51,615 --> 00:07:54,278
Well, would you mind, uhm,
helping it blow over?

134
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,951
My stock is kind of plummeting
around here.

135
00:07:57,156 --> 00:08:01,422
Oh, I don't mean to sound like a tool,
but maybe it's karma.

136
00:08:01,627 --> 00:08:04,254
Britta I know you're excited
to finally be popular with women,

137
00:08:04,321 --> 00:08:06,754
but don't get too high
on your own drama.

138
00:08:07,098 --> 00:08:10,125
High on my own drama?!

139
00:08:12,937 --> 00:08:14,398
People's champion.

140
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:18,170
Sorry, man,
I gotta go where the heat is.

141
00:08:18,543 --> 00:08:20,603
Jeff Winger, you're a jerk.

142
00:08:22,447 --> 00:08:24,574
She's turned every woman
on campus against me.

143
00:08:24,817 --> 00:08:27,843
Well, not every woman. Certainly not the one
that deserves to be with you.

144
00:08:28,052 --> 00:08:30,846
Annie, all women deserve to be with me,
and vice versa.

145
00:08:30,855 --> 00:08:33,235
Granted, but who doesn't eventually
settle down?

146
00:08:33,235 --> 00:08:36,534
I don't, and I never will. And if I did...

147
00:08:38,563 --> 00:08:40,532
If I did,

148
00:08:41,966 --> 00:08:44,025
I could beat Britta
at her own game.

149
00:08:45,504 --> 00:08:49,462
Oh, good.
Yeah, you better take a hike.

150
00:08:49,807 --> 00:08:52,402
Do you know
where the cleanest bathroom is?

151
00:08:52,945 --> 00:08:55,139
- Teacher's lounge.
- Thank you.

152
00:08:55,681 --> 00:08:57,774
Don't be shy, come on up,
have a sip.

153
00:08:58,017 --> 00:09:01,509
The yogi of India swear by
its restorative powers.

154
00:09:02,988 --> 00:09:07,152
Okay, more of my urine for me.

155
00:09:07,393 --> 00:09:09,121
Now, for your tribe's assignment.

156
00:09:09,727 --> 00:09:13,061
This box contains
nine different tools,

157
00:09:13,255 --> 00:09:16,282
all of them important
to humanity's survival.

158
00:09:16,601 --> 00:09:20,368
One of them,
is the most important of all.

159
00:09:20,572 --> 00:09:26,476
Your tribe's assignment for tomorrow
is to tell me which tool that is.

160
00:09:26,678 --> 00:09:29,010
Questions?
I have a question.

161
00:09:29,248 --> 00:09:31,078
But not for you.

162
00:09:31,283 --> 00:09:32,716
It's for Britta.

163
00:09:35,086 --> 00:09:36,519
Britta.

164
00:09:37,623 --> 00:09:38,749
I love you.

165
00:09:42,739 --> 00:09:46,538
Now I know this puts you
in an awkwardly powerful position,

166
00:09:46,631 --> 00:09:49,255
but I have to know, right now,
in front of everyone.

167
00:09:49,624 --> 00:09:51,716
Do you love me too?

168
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:58,576
More than anything in the world.

169
00:10:00,312 --> 00:10:01,870
- Really?
- Yeah.

170
00:10:02,715 --> 00:10:06,980
- So it begins.
- Hmm.

171
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:11,913
The greatest relationship
ever known.

172
00:10:22,134 --> 00:10:24,398
This is making me sick.

173
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,807
- I'm gonna love you forever.
- Good, I'm gonna love you forever.

174
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:35,133
- I don't believe you.
- Why, don't you want me to?

175
00:10:35,447 --> 00:10:37,414
No, I do. Bring it.

176
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,650
Doesn't it make you wanna cry?

177
00:10:40,852 --> 00:10:43,048
Something like that. Excuse me.

178
00:10:43,288 --> 00:10:45,729
I downloaded a song
that makes me think of you.

179
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:49,165
Let's listen to it,
each using one ear bud.

180
00:10:51,532 --> 00:10:53,080
Shirley, would you consider spinning off with me?

181
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:55,754
Just riffing, but we could open
a hair salon together.

182
00:10:55,801 --> 00:10:58,235
I don't understand.
Is this you being meta?

183
00:10:58,437 --> 00:11:01,985
I wanted to come out of the gate having adventures,
like paintball. This is boring.

184
00:11:01,985 --> 00:11:05,143
Well, I think that's selfish, Abed.
If you were a friend to Jeff and Britta,

185
00:11:05,144 --> 00:11:07,942
you would see their relationship
as an adventure.

186
00:11:08,523 --> 00:11:12,619
I hadn't thought about it that way.
Oh! Look at how they walk.

187
00:11:15,418 --> 00:11:19,745
Clearly, the most important tool to a tribe's survival is here.
The cross, representing Christianity.

188
00:11:19,825 --> 00:11:21,451
It's an ax.
It's an ax?

189
00:11:21,692 --> 00:11:25,458
Maybe the telescope. Look through
it backwards. Shrink your enemies.

190
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:28,383
I'll show you the tool that's
most important to our survival,

191
00:11:28,384 --> 00:11:31,509
but fair warning, it's my penis.

192
00:11:38,844 --> 00:11:40,004
Old White Man.

193
00:11:40,211 --> 00:11:42,806
Sorry I'm late.
I was in my car loving Britta.

194
00:11:47,318 --> 00:11:50,419
- I guess I just love you too much.
- Not half as much as me.

195
00:11:50,422 --> 00:11:53,296
- Aww.
- Jeff, do you think you'll marry Britta?

196
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:56,591
- I'd like to see someone stop me.
- I just peed a little.

197
00:11:57,729 --> 00:11:59,788
- Then here, propose.
- Oh.

198
00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:09,035
I got it, I got it, got it.
Jeff Winger, will you marry me?

199
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,868
Yeah, of course.

200
00:12:11,677 --> 00:12:14,368
No problem.
Perfect, I'll be right back.

201
00:12:16,581 --> 00:12:19,364
Thank the Lord, you're getting married.
I was so worried about your souls,

202
00:12:19,365 --> 00:12:22,061
ever since you had pre-marital sex
on the table.

203
00:12:23,422 --> 00:12:25,253
Oh!

204
00:12:25,456 --> 00:12:26,582
Awesome.

205
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:29,460
- You told Shirley?
- Well, there's no need for secrecy now.

206
00:12:29,461 --> 00:12:30,763
It was during the paintball game.

207
00:12:30,764 --> 00:12:33,357
Was there anything
you didn't win that day?

208
00:12:34,866 --> 00:12:36,061
Oh, my God!

209
00:12:36,802 --> 00:12:39,498
You slept with her
and then kissed me?

210
00:12:39,705 --> 00:12:40,729
What?

211
00:12:43,975 --> 00:12:48,003
♪ Now they're in so deep. ♪

212
00:12:48,212 --> 00:12:52,547
♪ You know she's such a fool for him. ♪

213
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:57,346
♪ She has a ring around her finger, ♪

214
00:12:57,556 --> 00:13:00,024
♪ and Abed hired an Irish singer. ♪

215
00:13:00,225 --> 00:13:04,981
♪ Britta's marrying, Britta's marrying
Britta's marrying Jeffrey Winger ♪

216
00:13:04,982 --> 00:13:08,177
- What the hell is this?
- A wedding, episode.

217
00:13:08,232 --> 00:13:10,462
- Abed, there's no wedding.
- Cold feet?

218
00:13:10,701 --> 00:13:12,897
Talk it over with your best man,
George Clooney.

219
00:13:13,105 --> 00:13:14,801
- What's up?
- He's a George Clooney impersonator,

220
00:13:14,802 --> 00:13:17,463
- but still razzle-dazzle, right?
- Abed?

221
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:19,067
Hmm?

222
00:13:19,912 --> 00:13:21,601
- Jeff made out with Annie.
- What?

223
00:13:21,613 --> 00:13:23,307
- When? Where?
- Yeah, where?

224
00:13:23,307 --> 00:13:25,832
That's inappropriate.
I'm assuming on the mouth.

225
00:13:25,911 --> 00:13:27,903
- It was after the Transfer Dance.
- Oh!

226
00:13:27,991 --> 00:13:32,591
So I tell you that I love you, and then you go
outside and stick your tongue into a teenager?

227
00:13:32,658 --> 00:13:34,386
What is wrong with you, Jeffrey?

228
00:13:34,592 --> 00:13:39,628
Well Shirley, since you have clearly failed
to grasp the central insipid metaphor

229
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:42,911
of those <i>Twilight</i> books you devour,
let me explain it to you.

230
00:13:42,912 --> 00:13:46,245
Men are monsters
who crave young flesh. The end.

231
00:13:46,337 --> 00:13:49,165
At least we have the decency
to be ashamed of it and keep it a secret,

232
00:13:49,173 --> 00:13:53,003
instead of publicly blurting <i>I love you</i>
to everyone who sleeps with us.

233
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:56,610
Oh, please, I never loved you.
Ah-ha!

234
00:13:56,615 --> 00:14:00,114
I win, I win, I win. In your face.

235
00:14:00,118 --> 00:14:01,482
So this was all a game?

236
00:14:01,753 --> 00:14:04,134
Everything they do
is some sick competition.

237
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:06,235
Oh... like you hate competition.

238
00:14:06,258 --> 00:14:09,615
How long did it take you to kiss Jeff
after I told him I loved him?

239
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:11,979
Oh, that's right.
First Vaughn, now Jeff.

240
00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:15,760
I better not smile at that wall outlet
or you'll fry your tongue off!

241
00:14:15,967 --> 00:14:17,575
Way to hog all the girls, Jeff.

242
00:14:17,576 --> 00:14:21,273
You know, when there's three sprinkle doughnuts,
you don't eat one and then lick another.

243
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:23,903
Anyone object to us
being referred to as doughnuts? No one?

244
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:26,571
I'm sorry we can't all be
as honorable as you Troy.

245
00:14:26,621 --> 00:14:28,988
And post Pierce quotes
all day on Twitter.

246
00:14:29,347 --> 00:14:32,976
Wow, is that your lame attempt
to try and pass the hot seat to me?

247
00:14:33,184 --> 00:14:36,120
- Nice try.
- Wait, I'm <i>Old White Man Says</i>?

248
00:14:36,321 --> 00:14:38,721
No wonder he says
everything I'm thinking.

249
00:14:38,923 --> 00:14:41,051
You bastard.

250
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:43,221
I'm just sharing what you say.

251
00:14:43,427 --> 00:14:46,192
Yeah, well, what if I shared
all the stuff you say?

252
00:14:46,398 --> 00:14:48,967
He thinks all dogs are boys
and all cats are girls.

253
00:14:48,969 --> 00:14:52,461
There's no way to disprove that.
Have you ever seen a cat penis?

254
00:14:52,748 --> 00:14:54,312
Where are you going?

255
00:14:54,605 --> 00:14:57,870
By the power vested in me,
I now pronounce you canceled.

256
00:14:58,076 --> 00:15:01,019
Oh, good. Yeah Abed, cancel us.
And while you're at it,

257
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:04,820
why don't you take your cutesy
"I can't tell life from TV" gimmick with you?

258
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,780
You know, it's very "season one".

259
00:15:12,224 --> 00:15:13,850
I can tell life from TV, Jeff.

260
00:15:14,058 --> 00:15:18,758
TV makes sense, it has structure,
logic, rules, and likable leading men.

261
00:15:18,963 --> 00:15:21,227
In life we have this.

262
00:15:21,566 --> 00:15:22,793
We have you.

263
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:33,590
I'm on the clock for another hour if
you want me to do some <i>Batman</i> lines.

264
00:15:53,168 --> 00:15:56,360
- Not sitting with your little group?
- The group is done.

265
00:15:56,371 --> 00:16:00,099
Yeah, well,
missionary accomplished, right?

266
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:04,197
What does that mean?
Come on, I know you and Britta did it.

267
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:06,879
Isn't the whole reason
you got together with those people?

268
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:09,077
Because you wanted to bang
the blond?

269
00:16:09,284 --> 00:16:11,913
Now I hear
that you Frenched the brunette.

270
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,419
What more could you have gotten
out of that group?

271
00:16:16,091 --> 00:16:17,456
Good morning, class.

272
00:16:17,692 --> 00:16:21,355
Let's dive in and hear the results
of your assignment.

273
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:22,792
Who wants to go first?

274
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:27,110
I don't know, Mr. Winger,
the last time I called on you,

275
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:30,638
I kind of got what the Maku-Maku
call "dirt-roaded."

276
00:16:30,985 --> 00:16:32,546
Using it.

277
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,543
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

278
00:16:36,846 --> 00:16:37,971
It was a trick question.

279
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,838
The tool most important
to humanity's survival

280
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,104
wasn't any of the nine in the box.

281
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,383
Go on.

282
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:49,883
The most important tool is respect.

283
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,417
Ha! Gay.

284
00:16:53,321 --> 00:16:55,515
And the reason I know
respect is a tool,

285
00:16:55,722 --> 00:16:59,124
is because it is clearly
not a natural thing

286
00:16:59,326 --> 00:17:01,488
and we forget to use it all the time.

287
00:17:01,696 --> 00:17:05,321
And then we start competing with
each other, and exploiting each other,

288
00:17:05,323 --> 00:17:08,486
and humiliating each other,
and controlling each other.

289
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,397
And we lose each other.

290
00:17:11,772 --> 00:17:15,003
And without each other,
we'll go extinct.

291
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:17,268
And that's a fact.

292
00:17:17,478 --> 00:17:19,001
Heh. A gay fact.

293
00:17:19,212 --> 00:17:20,702
That's my answer, professor.

294
00:17:21,548 --> 00:17:22,810
Hmm.

295
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:27,179
Well, that's one answer.

296
00:17:27,387 --> 00:17:29,321
Here's the one I had in mind.

297
00:17:29,523 --> 00:17:35,519
Combining all nine tools,
you get this,

298
00:17:35,762 --> 00:17:39,221
a deadlier weapon
than any one item in the box.

299
00:17:39,467 --> 00:17:42,527
So, I'm gonna use this to attack you,

300
00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:46,171
and you use respect
to defend yourself.

301
00:17:46,406 --> 00:17:47,567
Uh... Oh... Uh...

302
00:17:52,846 --> 00:17:54,508
- Oh, my God.
- Jeffrey.

303
00:17:54,714 --> 00:17:57,240
I respect you.

304
00:17:57,484 --> 00:18:00,009
That's why you fail.

305
00:18:02,222 --> 00:18:04,087
- Oh, my God.
- Jeffrey.

306
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:06,885
He's passing out.

307
00:18:07,728 --> 00:18:09,457
Stay with us, buddy.

308
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:12,712
- Hello.
- Oh, thank God.

309
00:18:12,713 --> 00:18:13,413
Hello Jeffrey.

310
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,490
What happened?

311
00:18:14,701 --> 00:18:17,864
Professor Bauer got suspended,
and we got an automatic A on our assignment.

312
00:18:17,865 --> 00:18:19,730
Did someone throw urine in my face?

313
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:22,527
Oh, sometimes I surprise myself under pressure.

314
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:26,436
Jeff, about the assignment,
we decided you had the right answer.

315
00:18:26,646 --> 00:18:29,513
I think we need more respect
and a little less passion.

316
00:18:29,717 --> 00:18:32,742
Which will be easy for me,
because I think you're kinda gross now.

317
00:18:32,953 --> 00:18:34,011
Awesome.

318
00:18:34,454 --> 00:18:36,445
Pierce, I'm gonna delete
that Twitter account.

319
00:18:36,656 --> 00:18:38,898
Your friendship is more important
than 600,000 strangers.

320
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:42,996
Wow, wow, wow . Are you saying 600,000
people read what I say on Twitter?

321
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:45,624
Come on, we gotta cash in on that.

322
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,996
How about <i>Old White Man Says,</i>
<i>the TV Show?</i>

323
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,232
- No.
- Who would watch that?

324
00:18:51,439 --> 00:18:54,306
Speaking of bad development
strategy, I owe you all an apology.

325
00:18:54,336 --> 00:18:56,093
I was trying so hard
to make our first week a great one,

326
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:58,123
that I didn't realize there was something great
in front of us the whole time.

327
00:18:58,496 --> 00:19:00,496
An old woman drinking her own pee.

328
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,048
- You're Right.
- That's true.

329
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,240
Guys?

330
00:19:04,484 --> 00:19:05,519
I got a confession to make.

331
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,320
I took <i>Anthropology</i> because
I wanna be a part of your study group.

332
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:13,423
Now I gotta do the honest thing
and just ask.

333
00:19:13,693 --> 00:19:18,131
Is there any room in this pocket
for a little spare Chang?

334
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:23,075
Uh... look, we've been through a lot today.

335
00:19:23,637 --> 00:19:26,864
- Give us a little time to think it over.
- Totally, totally, man.

336
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:30,070
Just think about it.
Take your time and let me know.

337
00:19:30,278 --> 00:19:31,836
- Bye.
- See you, Chang.

338
00:19:31,945 --> 00:19:33,208
Bye.

339
00:19:33,248 --> 00:19:36,275
Aww. Poor guy.
We'll let him in eventually.

340
00:19:36,349 --> 00:19:37,442
Says who?

341
00:19:37,465 --> 00:19:39,626
Look, we have the strength
to survive anything.

342
00:19:39,755 --> 00:19:41,829
What's the worst that can happen
with Chang?

343
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:44,163
- Yeah, that's true.
- Yeah, Good point.

344
00:19:46,493 --> 00:19:49,361
I told you they hate you.

345
00:19:50,998 --> 00:19:54,433
No, they said
they just needed more time.

346
00:19:54,634 --> 00:19:57,762
Time? They destroyed your life.

347
00:19:57,971 --> 00:20:01,305
How much time
before we take revenge?

348
00:20:01,509 --> 00:20:02,999
But they're my friends.

349
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:05,269
I'm your only friend.

350
00:20:05,479 --> 00:20:07,208
No.

351
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,279
No.

352
00:20:09,482 --> 00:20:11,075
