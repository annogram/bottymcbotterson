1
00:00:01,084 --> 00:00:03,337
And then, in the season finale...

2
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:06,840
they reveal the whole thing was
a dream when the inspector wakes up...

3
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:11,094
next to a very young
and very topless Cheryl Tiegs.

4
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:13,805
Even Pierce loves this show now?

5
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:17,309
It's not Inspector Spacetime. It's
the American version, and a travesty.

6
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:20,979
- It's obvious, sexist, and the timing is...
- Honey, I'm dean.

7
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:24,483
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Oh, Jeffrey, you are too much.

8
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:29,029
Why, I was doing some house cleaning
the other day, Deana Reed style...

9
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:33,200
when I realised, gosh, golly,
it's been ages since we had a dance.

10
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:37,079
So this Friday we are going back
to Greendale's golden age...

11
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:42,543
with an old-fashioned sock hop. Health
Department requires you wear shoes.

12
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:45,087
What a coinci-dean.
Throwing a dance the same day...

13
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,548
the CDC is confiscating
our drinking fountains.

14
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:50,133
- Well...
- Placating students with a fun event.

15
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:51,552
Classic bread and circuses.

16
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:54,054
In Rome, the emperor
would distract the populace...

17
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:56,348
by allocating money
for bread and circuses.

18
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,393
I'm trying to get away
from filtering everything through TV.

19
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:00,685
Time I showed growth.

20
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,689
"It's been three and a half seasons,"
the old me would've said.

21
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:09,027
Anyhoo, it is a Sadie Hawkins dance,
which means girls ask the boys.

22
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,319
Oh, I love those.

23
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:13,156
So, ladies, get out there
and make yourselves useful.

24
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:16,952
So there's one day a year when women
are free to choose their own mates?

25
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:19,037
What is this, cave-person times?

26
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,665
I have already started
on a Sadie Hawkins banner...

27
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:23,667
so this is pretty much set in stone.

28
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,460
Then maybe I'll throw my own dance.

29
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,338
One that doesn't conform
to your oppressive gender norms.

30
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,715
Give me a break.

31
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:33,885
You think a dance
can just be thrown together willy-nilly?

32
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:38,015
You think I decide to just do a
rainforest theme and buy palm fronds...

33
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:40,892
and rig the sprinkler system...?
I gotta write this down.

34
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:44,813
♪ Give me some more
Time in a dream ♪

35
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:48,191
♪ Give me the hope
To run out of steam ♪

36
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:51,320
♪ Somebody said It can be here ♪

37
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:55,532
♪ We could be roped up
Tied up dead in a year ♪

38
00:01:55,824 --> 00:02:00,329
♪ I can't count the reasons
I should stay ♪

39
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:04,583
♪ One by one they all
Just fade away ♪

40
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:12,049
So, Britta, you're gonna throw
a protest dance? Is that a thing?

41
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:13,341
It is now.

42
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:17,804
And instead of Sadie Hawkins, my
dance will honour a real feminist icon...

43
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:21,642
someone who worked for
women's rights every day of the year...

44
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:23,560
Sophie B. Hawkins.

45
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:26,647
It wasn't really...

46
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:29,650
You know what, Britta? You're right.

47
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:32,653
A Sophie B. Hawkins dance
is just what this school needs.

48
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,071
Thanks, Jeff.

49
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:38,075
To celebrate Sophie B. Hawkins
and all her accomplishments.

50
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:40,702
Jeez, Winger, who's throwing
this dance, me or you?

51
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:44,081
Britta, I think you meant to say
Susan B. Anthony...

52
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:45,791
not Sophie B. Hawkins.

53
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:49,252
Britta for the whoops. Didn't you have
a cat named Susan B. Anthony?

54
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:50,629
How'd you Britta that?

55
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:53,590
I didn't Britta anything.
I meant Sophie B. Hawkins.

56
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,301
Really?
Your plan was to throw a dance...

57
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:59,471
honouring the singer of
"Damn I wish I Was Your Lover"?

58
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:02,182
And "As I Lay Me Down,"
which is the far superior song.

59
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:03,975
- That is a good song.
- Yeah.

60
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,435
Yes.

61
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:09,356
I am throwing
a Sophie B. Hawkins dance.

62
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:11,358
And it is gonna be amazing.

63
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,444
And when people come
they're gonna be like:

64
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:17,489
"Damn. She straight Britta'd this."

65
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:21,118
Because, that's right,
I'm taking it back.

66
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:29,418
You're really doing this? As one who
faked being a lawyer for seven years...

67
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:33,046
I appreciate your commitment to
the bit, but just admit you were wrong.

68
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:36,341
- So you can say I Britta'd it?
- Yes. That goes without saying.

69
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,719
But come on, it was a small mistake.

70
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,597
Call this off before it becomes a
full-scale "Brit-astrophe." I coined that.

71
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,558
If you don't wanna come to my dance...

72
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,060
you are free to go
to the Sadie Hawkins dance...

73
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:50,856
which will be happening
at the same time across the cafeteria.

74
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:54,443
- Our school has limited venue options.
- Oh, I wouldn't miss it.

75
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,236
Oh, and one last thing.

76
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:59,406
You do realise that if you call it
a Sophie B. Hawkins dance...

77
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:03,410
people will expect Sophie B. Hawkins
to actually be there, right?

78
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,913
Yes.

79
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:12,836
And when she comes I'm gonna be like
"I Will Remember You" doubting me.

80
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:15,255
That's a Sarah McLachlan song.

81
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:21,261
So, Abed, I was thinking about
what you said about showing growth...

82
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,680
and I was thinking
maybe one way to do that...

83
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,266
- is to meet new people and...
- Where's this going?

84
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:28,560
Can I set you up with a date
for the dance?

85
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:32,898
Blind date. I've always thought of myself
as more of an acquired taste, but okay.

86
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,526
If you're open to meeting someone,
there's eligible ladies in my church.

87
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,905
Shirley, I'm already finding
a date forAbed. I asked first.

88
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:43,283
There's no reason we can't both help.
Why don't we each pick a girl...

89
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:46,203
and let Abed decide,
instead of making it a competition?

90
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:48,038
- That's a competition.
- So it is.

91
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,123
Only for the loser.

92
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,753
- I need the computer.
- There are, like, dozens of computers.

93
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:56,797
- But my e-mail's on this one.
- Pierce.

94
00:04:57,088 --> 00:05:00,008
- Jeez, what's up your butt?
- I may have lied about...

95
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,969
meaning Sophie B. Hawkins.
I didn't want Jeff to make fun.

96
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:07,766
And then I may have lied to cover
that lie, and now I'm in deep lies.

97
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:10,644
So what? So you told a lie, big deal.

98
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:13,313
The important thing is
never to admit it.

99
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,440
I was thinking about coming clean.

100
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:18,151
And give Winger the satisfaction?
Hell, no.

101
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:21,571
Besides, anything can happen between
now and the dance.

102
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:22,863
An asteroid could hit.

103
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:26,243
Do you wanna be the schmuck who
apologizes just before the world ends?

104
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:29,746
That kind of makes sense. Thank you.

105
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,122
Damn right it makes sense.

106
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,834
You're talking to the wisest man
on campus.

107
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,877
Now seriously,
I need to get to my e-mail.

108
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,421
- The post office is about to close.
- Pierce.

109
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:41,007
Check out my friend Britta's
Sophie B. Hawkins dance.

110
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,343
I'll be spinning hits
from yesterday and today.

111
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:45,595
Which are the same to me
since I have Changnesia.

112
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:48,181
The guy's Teflon.
No matter how much awful he does...

113
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:51,893
- he keeps getting another chance.
- He's like the Colin Farrell of people.

114
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:55,689
Wanna help me with Britta's dance?
Could be a chance for classic high jinks.

115
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:58,233
In the interest of growth
I'm avoiding high jinks.

116
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,152
And capers, romps, and exploits.
Escapades are a grey area.

117
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:02,570
Abed.

118
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:05,657
- This is Kat.
- Hi, Kat. Nice to meet you.

119
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,993
She wants to ask you something.

120
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:12,622
Isn't she perfect? She's like one of
those quirky girls from the movies.

121
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:16,376
I saw her in the cafeteria
trying to pay for lunch with a song.

122
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:24,384
I asked if you'd go to the Sadie Hawkins
dance with me into the balloon.

123
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:25,719
Could you hear it?

124
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:29,389
- Sure, I'd be happy to go with you.
- Super-duper, Mr. Cooper.

125
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:37,355
- Nice.
- So you chose the girl I picked.

126
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,567
It's cool. It's not like
it was a competition or anything.

127
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:43,862
Just be gentle when you tell Shirley
that she was the loser.

128
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:47,490
- Or do you want me to tell her?
- It's cool. I'll handle it.

129
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:52,662
So was that girl an alien
or a toddler with a growing disease?

130
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:55,373
Hello, Abed. I talked to a lovely girl...

131
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,876
at church and she'd be happy
to go to the dance.

132
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,587
- I appreciate it, but...
- I hope you will consider it...

133
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,423
and not just because saying no
would crush this girl...

134
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:06,801
but because I don't want you to miss
the opportunity of a lifetime.

135
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,093
You're right.

136
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:11,264
- I'd love to go to Britta's dance with her.
- Good, I'll set it up.

137
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:14,392
Oh, I hope this doesn't hurt
Annie's feelings.

138
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:17,020
- Maybe I should go tell her.
- No need. I'll handle it.

139
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:19,272
Oh, okay. Bye-bye.

140
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,818
At the risk of discovering I'm living
parallel lives like in Awake...

141
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,571
- don't you already have a date?
- Yep. Now I have two.

142
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,616
Which means I can do the
two-dates-in-one-night sitcom trope.

143
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:31,785
I'll wear two outfits.
Mix up their names.

144
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,787
- Hide under a table.
- What about growth?

145
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,916
I tried to go in a grounded direction but
ended up in an implausible situation.

146
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:41,294
Like Shirley said, it's a once-in-lifetime
opportunity for high jinks.

147
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,588
- I can't pass it up.
- You already passed up...

148
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,882
- a great opportunity for high jinks.
- I did?

149
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,593
Britta's dance?
You think two dates is crazy?

150
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:52,305
Planning a dance is high jinks city.
Population: High jinks.

151
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,474
Troy, I need your help.

152
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,309
Get some ice.

153
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,728
Wacky ice.

154
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,605
The ice will be wacky.

155
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,988
- Looks good, huh?
- I'm so excited.

156
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,781
Thank you for the corsage.

157
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:13,785
- It matches your carnation. How cute.
- I'm glad you like it.

158
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,805
I was afraid you'd think
it was old-fashioned.

159
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:19,082
I like old-fashioned. I find it refreshing.

160
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:24,004
Speaking of refreshing, I'm gonna
get us some punch. Be right back.

161
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:31,011
Hi, I'm Kevin.
Apparently I'm your DJ tonight.

162
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:33,013
I really don't know what I'm doing...

163
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,974
so if you have a request,
please be specific.

164
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,434
I have Changnesia.

165
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:45,275
- Can I help you?
- I wanted to try on a different look.

166
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,820
I'm pretty indecisive, so I may be
back here a few times, if that's okay.

167
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:50,112
Cool.

168
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,532
I'm also gonna need
to check this Gideons Bible...

169
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,868
and this jelly-bean kaleidoscope.

170
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:56,870
Icebreakers.

171
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,205
Hey, Britta. Where's Sophie B.?

172
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:02,459
She backstage drinking Zima
and counting her Beanie Babies?

173
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,127
Sorry, I can't divulge that.

174
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:07,547
- Stars and their privacy, you know.
- But she'll definitely be here?

175
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,674
Oh, yeah. Sophie be coming.

176
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:14,012
So it just be coincidence that somebody
posted a Craigslist ad an hour ago...

177
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,848
that says,
"Looking for Sophie B. Hawkins..."

178
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,392
or convincing Sophie B. Hawkins
impersonator...

179
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:23,897
"to play community college
dance tonight. Very little money."

180
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,732
It's weird how in demand she is.

181
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:28,860
Good thing we booked her early.

182
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,863
Britta, we're running low on chips.
Here's what I'm thinking.

183
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,657
I go to the Sadie Hawkins dance
as the snack inspector...

184
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,410
doing random spot checks,
and confiscate their chips.

185
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,120
All I need is a disguise.

186
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,582
Or you could just go to the supply
closet and get some more chips.

187
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:45,919
Okay, but I still need
to use the moustache probably.

188
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,425
Here, in lieu of flowers, I got you this.

189
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,302
- It's quirky.
- Thanks, governor.

190
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,555
I'll just put it in me invisible sack.

191
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,142
Okay, I'm gonna get us some punch.

192
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,273
Hey. How are things going
with you and Jessica?

193
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:10,026
Are you two, as they say on TV,
making a connection?

194
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,737
Unless that means sex,
in which case I hope you're not.

195
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,740
Things are great. Actually,
Jessica did mention she's cold.

196
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,576
Could she borrow your sweater?
The one you wore last week.

197
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,788
- I think it's still in your locker.
- I guess I could check.

198
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,624
- Could you? That'd be great.
- Okay.

199
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:27,751
Hey, roomie.

200
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:30,755
What do you think of Kat?
Did she tell you she plays the saw?

201
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:34,217
- I thought she was in a kazoo band?
- They need a rhythm section, duh.

202
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,176
Well, keep me posted.

203
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,805
- I'm gonna go say hi to Britta.
- No, don't.

204
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:41,141
You have something
in your teeth. A lot.

205
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:45,103
- I do? What is it?
- Can't tell in this light. But it's there.

206
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:47,939
You should check it in the bathroom.
The second-floor one.

207
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:51,067
I will. Thank you. You're a good friend.

208

209
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,120
Hello, Jeffrey.

210
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,455
Are you enjoying the sock hop?

211
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:09,002
A sock hop Britta has all but Britta'd
by not Britta'ing her own dance.

212
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:10,503
Well, the night is young.

213
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,339
I'm surprised you let her
share the cafeteria.

214
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:14,631
Oh, I didn't want to.

215
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:18,887
But once she guaranteed the presence
of a certain someone, I couldn't say no.

216
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,306
I wouldn't get your hopes up
for Sophie B...

217
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:24,100
- Oh, it's me.
- Shall we dance?

218
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,188
- You reading the Bible?
- No spoilers.

219
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:31,441
I'm really hoping that things
turn around for this Job guy.

220
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,193
So how do I look?

221
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:38,156
Good. Except you gotta lose the hat.
Doesn't go with the minister's daughter.

222
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:44,037
- You know what I'm doing.
- Yeah. You're on two dates at once.

223
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:47,165
- I've been watching since you came in.
- I'm not good with faces.

224
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:49,042
Is that a judgmental or happy face?

225
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:51,544
I think it's awesome.
It's one of my favourite bits.

226
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,254
Like when a dog acts embarrassed:

227
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,758
Or when a guy chases a girl and
does that public declaration of love.

228
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,811
It's not realistic. It's turning
something private into a performance.

229
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:00,968
I think the dog's trained.

230
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,473
I was talking about the
public declaration of love.

231
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,726
- Oh, you're messing with me.
- Yes, I was.

232
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:09,938
This thing's turning out to be tougher
than I thought. Wanna help?

233
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:13,983
I'd like to, but I still got 1200 pages
left of this Bible. Yes, of course I would.

234
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,485
Cool. Cool, cool, cool.

235
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:19,530
Tonight's Sadie Hawkins dance
is brought to you by Hawthorne Wipes.

236
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,242
For the little lady
who knows her place in the kitchen.

237
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:27,288
And tonight's Sophie B. Hawkins dance
is brought to you by Hawthorne Wipes.

238
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,416
Perfect for cleaning the dashboard
of your '92 Subaru.

239
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:35,088
Quite a turnout, Britta.

240
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:38,883
Yep. Didn't know Sophie B. Hawkins
was so big at Greendale.

241
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,175
Oh, yeah.

242
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:44,180
A large percentage of Greendale
students gave up in the mid-'90s.

243
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:48,226
For many of them, Sophie B. Hawkins is
the most recent music they're aware of.

244
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:52,230
I mean, her coming here is
gonna be a huge boost to their spirits.

245
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:53,522
Great.

246
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:58,611
Whereas, her not showing up
would be enough to push these people...

247
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:03,616
to a dark place and really question
whether life is worth living at all.

248
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:06,786
Okay, bye-bye.

249
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:11,124
So how long have you been
doing Bible studies?

250
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,042
I mean, making hats out of duct tape.

251
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,419
Oh, duct-tape hat...

252
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,675
You never saw the
Star wars movies?

253
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,945
We were taught popular films
were the work of the devil.

254
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,763
If you're talking about Phantom Menace,
you were taught right.

255
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:27,473
Telegram.

256
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,810
Yeah, it's urgent. Be right back.

257
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,564
Pierce,
Sophie B. Hawkins isn't coming.

258
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:36,816
Everyone's gonna know I'm a liar.
Help me.

259
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:38,234
Oh, Britta.

260
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:41,863
Let me tell you a story about a friend
of mine that everyone called a liar.

261
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,907
- His name was Bernie Madoff.
- Pierce, he was a liar.

262
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,410
He stole billions of dollars
from his clients.

263
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,496
Has this been confirmed?

264
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,332
Oh, my God.

265
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,542
I Britta'd it.

266
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:57,503
Bernie?

267
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,716
- Oh, hi, Shirley.
- Hello, Annie.

268
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:05,136
Abed seems to be having a good time,
which is all that matters.

269
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:06,512
You're right.

270
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:09,807
- Looks like he made the right choice.
- He certainly did.

271
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,352
So we agree. The best woman won.

272
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:14,145
She certainly did.

273
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:18,858
- He's on two dates, isn't he?
- He certainly is.

274
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,071
This is the most fun I've ever had
on a work-study gig.

275
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:26,449
And I used to run the frozen-yogurt
machine before that guy broke it.

276
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:28,618
Many close calls.
Keep forgetting details...

277
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,329
using the wrong names,
having to duck behind plants.

278
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:35,041
- This night has been perfect.
- Oh, what else is on the list?

279
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,126
Sorry.

280
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:45,009
If this were a movie,
this would be the part where we kiss.

281
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:50,390
You're right. Except we're doing
a sitcom trope, so it'd be out of place.

282
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:53,309
Time to go get caught
and make a plea to the girl I like.

283
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:57,230
I'm gonna go with Jessica. She seems
to be the audience favourite. Okay, bye.

284
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:08,074
- You thought you'd get away with this?
- Let me explain.

285
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:11,077
What about wanting to grow?
Was that a lie so you could do...

286
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:13,329
another world-famous
Abed TV adventure?

287
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:17,500
These are real people you're messing
with. Kat is Hula-Hooping all by herself.

288
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:21,212
Abed, in the real world,
people can actually get hurt.

289
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,925
- Message for the party.
- This is great.

290
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:30,680
So I got a request for,
"You suck at this. Get off the stage."

291
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:33,099
Okay, I don't know if that's the band
or the song.

292
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:36,102
Again, apologies. Changnesia.

293
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:40,857
Well, it blew up in my face in a
slightly different way than I planned.

294
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:42,859
Can I help you?

295
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:44,902
- Where's Rachel?
- She said she had to go.

296
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,071
- Where?
- I don't know. She seemed upset.

297
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,615
She ran out of here
without tagging half this stuff.

298
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,451
I mean, whose water wings are these?

299
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,370
- Come back here.
- Never mind.

300
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:04,839
I know.

301
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:07,425
I'm sorry.
I did mean what I said about growth.

302
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:10,928
But you were both so intent on
getting me dates, I couldn't help myself.

303
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,473
It was wrong, and hurtful.
I see that now.

304
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:16,517
Well, maybe setting you up
was a bad idea.

305
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,604
Yeah, I guess neither of our girls
were really right for you.

306
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:22,648
The worst part is
I met a girl tonight that I really do like.

307
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,651
I was so busy chasing one trope,
I missed one under my nose...

308
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,904
The girl I liked
was under my nose.

309
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:30,948
I screwed things up.
I don't know if I can make them right.

310
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,825
Wait. This one's real, right?

311
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,119
Yeah, I'm really sad.

312
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,163
Well, go find her, dummy.

313
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:38,998
Yeah, haven't you ever seen a movie?

314
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:43,419
Sophie. Sophie. Sophie.

315
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,339
Sophie. Sophie. Sophie.

316
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:50,092
I hate to say I told you so,
but I'm gonna say it to Britta's face.

317
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,929
Sophie. Sophie. Sophie.

318
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:54,847
What is the nature of hope?

319
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,016
Sophie's not coming, guys.

320
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:04,690
Looks like someone underestimated
the time it takes to plan a dance.

321
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,861
Hey, hey, hey. It's Sophie B. Hawkins.

322
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:23,125
Good evening. I'm Sophie B. Hawkins.

323
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:24,544
I think you know this one.

324
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,629
Oh, man.

325
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,601
Did you do this?

326
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:45,064
If it's possible to make something
happen by willing it then, yes, I did.

327
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:09,879
Sorry, Sophie.

328
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,882
- I have something to say.
- Hey.

329
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,176
- Come on, man.
- Come on.

330
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:17,096
There was a girl here tonight.
Her name was Rachel.

331
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:22,268
I met her, and it was very pleasant.
And I made a mistake.

332
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:27,648
And now I'd very much like to
continue this conversation in private.

333
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,859
Wow, viva lost love.

334
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:42,204
- You came back.
- That was pretty embarrassing.

335
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:43,914
I had to...

336
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:45,666
It was.

337
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,001
But I'm glad I did it.

338
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,045
So would you like to go out sometime?

339
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:50,337
I would like that.

340
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:53,007
Wanna pretend
you're just going out with me on a bet?

341
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:54,467
Oh, I'd like that very much.

342
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:57,637
- But maybe we should try normal first.
- Sure.

343
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:03,267
- I prefer "As I Lay Me Down."
- Me too.

344
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:08,981
- I can't believe she pulled this off.
- I know.

345
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,651
According to dean law,
I must now give her my amulet.

346
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:14,362
What?

347
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,823
Well, she had a little help
from a wise old man...

348
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:21,619
who was the official supplier
of moist towelettes to the Lilith Fair...

349
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:24,580
- between 1997 and 1999.
- I knew it.

350
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:26,999
You're safe.

351
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,669
You did this? But why?

352
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,506
Because in the face of all logic
and reason, Britta didn't back down.

353
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,468
- That makes no sense.
- And I didn't like you being a jerk to her.

354
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,346
- She was acting crazy.
- Yeah, but what choice did she have?

355
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:43,683
You make fun of her, you use her name
as a synonym for screwing up.

356
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,351
Cut her some slack, Jeff.

357
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:48,396
She helped you reconcile
with your dad.

358
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,148
For Pete's sake, let her be happy.

359
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,791
I know it's probably impossible
to read my texts...

360
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,460
without them sounding sarcastic...

361
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,880
but I assure you,
this one is as earnest as they come.

362
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,717
Congratulations
on an awesome dance.

363
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:20,386
You Britta'd the hell out of this thing.

364
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,543
Can you do one
where you wish you had ice cream?

365
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:55,588
Damn, I wish I had some ice cream.

366
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:56,963
So good.

367
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,383
Okay, can you do one
where you wish I was Batman?

368
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:02,595
- Fine, but this is the last one.
- Okay.

369
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:06,056
Damn, I wish Abed was Batman

370
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,548
- I love it so much.
- So good.

371
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,436
All right, you guys are taking
advantage of Ms. B. Hawkins.

372
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:13,230
- But... But...
- But you nothing, she's an artist.

373
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,775
She is not here to do your bidding.

374
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,193
Sorry about that.

375
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:20,237
Now, if you could just sing
"Dean, I wish I was Your Lover"...

376
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,656
with these new lyrics.
It's for my voicemail.

377
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,909
- Who's Jeff Winger?
- Just sing the damn song.

377
00:21:25,305 --> 00:21:31,588
