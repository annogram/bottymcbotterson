1
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:05,992
Hmm.

2
00:00:06,025 --> 00:00:07,343
Shirley, did you ever date
Roger Ebert?

3
00:00:07,376 --> 00:00:09,458
- Excuse me?
- Nothing.

4
00:00:09,792 --> 00:00:10,958
Britta, did you ever
take pictures of your feet

5
00:00:10,993 --> 00:00:12,227
and post them on the Internet
for money?

6
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:13,862
Sha-ha!
No.

7
00:00:13,897 --> 00:00:16,330
Guys, this history final
is going to be killer.

8
00:00:16,382 --> 00:00:17,783
We have to study.

9
00:00:17,817 --> 00:00:19,283
It's no fair
Professor Cornwallis

10
00:00:19,318 --> 00:00:21,053
turned all hard-assed again.

11
00:00:21,086 --> 00:00:22,022
Lucky Pierce.

12
00:00:22,143 --> 00:00:24,073
Donating his kidney to Gilbert
to get out of it.

13
00:00:24,106 --> 00:00:25,740
I never thought
he'd be that generous.

14
00:00:25,774 --> 00:00:27,259
Although,
he did seem disappointed

15
00:00:27,292 --> 00:00:28,493
that the operation
didn't involve

16
00:00:28,527 --> 00:00:29,762
sleeping with a Russian woman,

17
00:00:29,795 --> 00:00:30,812
then waking up
in a bathtub full of ice.

18
00:00:30,847 --> 00:00:31,896
- Hmm.
- Guys!

19
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:32,506
- Hmm?
- History!

20
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:33,643
I am studying history.

21
00:00:33,832 --> 00:00:34,545
I'm studying our history.

22
00:00:34,607 --> 00:00:36,851
- Abed!
- Nobody bite.

23
00:00:36,886 --> 00:00:38,353
We agreed no biting.

24
00:00:38,387 --> 00:00:39,838
But, Jeff,
it's a graduation gift.

25
00:00:39,871 --> 00:00:41,472
You see, on the surface we seem
like just a group of people

26
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:43,875
from diverse backgrounds who
have become unlikely friends.

27
00:00:43,909 --> 00:00:45,226
But according to my research,

28
00:00:45,261 --> 00:00:46,978
our paths have crossed
many times.

29
00:00:47,012 --> 00:00:49,093
We were destined to meet.
Like a team of superheroes.

30
00:00:49,098 --> 00:00:51,716
This is our origin story.

31
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,975
And here...we...go.

32
00:00:54,094 --> 00:00:55,704
Abed, we don't have
origin stories.

33
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:57,055
We have lives.

34
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,057
Well, at least--

35
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:02,210
yep, just me.

36
00:01:02,244 --> 00:01:03,795
So you're saying
we're all connected

37
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:05,513
like the classic
French film trilogy

38
00:01:05,548 --> 00:01:07,615
<i>Bleu, Blanc, Rouge?</i>

39
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,751
No, like something
more accessible.

40
00:01:08,784 --> 00:01:10,102
- Like <i>Unbreakable.</i>
<i>- Wow.</i>

41
00:01:10,135 --> 00:01:11,936
Abed, I know
it's disappointing to you,

42
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:13,287
but we're not superheroes.

43
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,289
This is the real world,
not some comic book adventure.

44
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:18,960
I've done it.
I've infiltrated the school.

45
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,712
I've learned its secrets.

46
00:01:20,746 --> 00:01:22,513
I've gained everyone's trust.

47
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:25,734
And now, on the anniversary
of my empire's destruction,

48
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:27,319
vengeance will be mine.

49
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:30,171
No, vengeance will be ours.

50
00:01:30,206 --> 00:01:34,276
Okay, can you stop that?
It really creeps me out.

51
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,694
I'm sorry.
Just really love this thing.

52
00:01:36,728 --> 00:01:38,546

63
00:02:06,676 --> 00:02:08,460
I've been doing exhaustive
research into our lives.

64
00:02:08,478 --> 00:02:10,062
Once I find the last
one or two missing pieces,

65
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:12,396
I'll have conclusive proof that
we were all destined to meet.

66
00:02:12,431 --> 00:02:14,081
This is how
we're all connected.

67
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,033
I call it the crazy quilt
of destiny

68
00:02:16,051 --> 00:02:17,735
mainly because the loom of fate
was already taken.

69
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,037
- Really?
- Look.

70
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:20,271
I don't care what tricks
or nonsense you have

71
00:02:20,289 --> 00:02:21,956
in your scrapbook,
Martha Stewart,

72
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,341
but there's no way
you're gonna get me to believe

73
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:26,395
there's some outside force
controlling my destiny.

74
00:02:26,429 --> 00:02:27,778
And I think you used
that particular phrasing

75
00:02:27,812 --> 00:02:29,448
because I know
you've seen <i>Star Wars.</i>

76
00:02:29,481 --> 00:02:31,650
Everybody's seen <i>Star Wars.</i>

77
00:02:31,683 --> 00:02:33,817
Yes, but you first saw it
when it was re-released in 1982

78
00:02:33,836 --> 00:02:36,253
at the Greendale Palladium
at 4:15 in the afternoon.

79
00:02:36,271 --> 00:02:37,573
And it was the best time
you ever had with your father.

80
00:02:37,606 --> 00:02:38,890
How did you know that?

81
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:41,126
You keep this ticket stub
in your wallet.

82
00:02:41,144 --> 00:02:42,927
Abed, you can't--

83
00:02:42,961 --> 00:02:45,197
- Give it back!
- Whoa!

84
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,533
Our story begins in
the distant mists of a lost era:

85
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:50,185
2008.

86
00:02:52,055 --> 00:02:54,423
I know you're all wondering
how I do it.

87
00:02:54,456 --> 00:02:57,992
How do I balance straight As,
extracurriculars,

88
00:02:58,026 --> 00:03:00,679
and Israeli folk dancing
every Friday night?

89
00:03:00,712 --> 00:03:05,834
It's a simple matter
of organization,

90
00:03:05,884 --> 00:03:10,438
dedication, and...

91
00:03:16,862 --> 00:03:18,729
And we're back!

92
00:03:18,747 --> 00:03:20,699
Then I drink your milkshake.

93
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,102
Ah, that will never get old.

94
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,787
You guys gotta see my <i>Juno.</i>

95
00:03:25,822 --> 00:03:27,155
Hey, Troy.

96
00:03:27,189 --> 00:03:29,358
So I heard you weren't
doing that great in algebra,

97
00:03:29,391 --> 00:03:32,276
and you know,
if you need a tutor for math,

98
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,812
I'd be happy to help.

99
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:35,129
I'm being recruited
by colleges to play football.

100
00:03:35,163 --> 00:03:36,949
- Oh.
- I don't have time for math.

101
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:39,317
The only thing that matters
to me are statistics.

102
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:40,602
Ooh!

103
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,687
Uh, that's also a type of math.

104
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,224
But we already knew
I went to high school with Troy,

105
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,377
and it's not like he even
remembered I existed.

106
00:03:48,411 --> 00:03:49,828
Yeah, I don't remember her
at all.

107
00:03:49,861 --> 00:03:51,163
We should probably drop this.

108
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:52,557
Wait, where's Pierce
on this chart?

109
00:03:52,581 --> 00:03:53,598
His contribution to the group

110
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:54,816
has already been noted.

111
00:03:54,866 --> 00:03:56,067
Pierce Hawthorne.
Fixture at Greendale.

112
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:57,218
Unavoidable.

113
00:03:57,252 --> 00:03:59,170
- Hey, is that a sad face?
- I wouldn't know.

114
00:03:59,187 --> 00:04:00,771
You have to look deeper.
Here. Take this, for example.

115
00:04:00,806 --> 00:04:02,123
It's a receipt I found

116
00:04:02,157 --> 00:04:03,442
in the back of Shirley's
sock drawer on Thanksgiving.

117
00:04:03,475 --> 00:04:05,395
You went in my bedroom
for some comic book thing?

118
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,846
Oh, no, my feet were cold.
Ah, here.

119
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:09,281
- You should probably wash those.
- Oh.

120
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:10,581
Discovering the receipt
was dumb luck,

121
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:11,832
but it proves
that we were at the mall

122
00:04:11,867 --> 00:04:13,534
on the exact same day.

123
00:04:13,568 --> 00:04:14,786
Shirley, do remember
what you bought for $54

124
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:15,971
at the Love Hut?

125
00:04:16,004 --> 00:04:18,273
What? Hmm?
No.

126
00:04:18,307 --> 00:04:21,259
So excited about tonight,
honey.

127
00:04:21,276 --> 00:04:22,810
Uh-huh. It's been too long

128
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:26,331
since we had adult time
without the kids.

129
00:04:26,365 --> 00:04:27,699
Oh!

130
00:04:27,733 --> 00:04:31,369
Well, I may have an anniversary
surprise for you too.

131
00:04:31,387 --> 00:04:33,137
Well, I'm in public, but, uh...

132
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:34,273
you know you gonna get it,
right?

133
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:37,542
You gonna get it!

134
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,980
So we were at the mall
on the same day.

135
00:04:42,014 --> 00:04:44,816
<i>Unbreakable.</i>

136
00:04:44,834 --> 00:04:46,317
Mail call.

137
00:04:46,351 --> 00:04:48,552
That's all right.
Won't be needing it today.

138
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:50,689
But Kevin always takes
the mail.

139
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:52,423
Well, today's mail's
kind of important.

140
00:04:52,457 --> 00:04:54,925
It's the day that I send in
Greendale's lease renewal.

141
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,894
Lease re-new-al?

142
00:04:56,913 --> 00:04:58,213
It's a critical document.

143
00:04:58,247 --> 00:05:00,247
See, Greendale sublets our land
from the Arapaho nation.

144
00:05:00,283 --> 00:05:01,733
Ah.

145
00:05:01,766 --> 00:05:03,802
Miss a renewal and faster
than you can say "wounded knee,"

146
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:07,855
we turn into a casino
and midsize concert venue.

147
00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:10,391
So you only trust me
with busywork?

148
00:05:10,442 --> 00:05:13,762
Oh, no, that's not--

149
00:05:13,795 --> 00:05:16,230
Kevin, ah--

150
00:05:16,264 --> 00:05:18,182
I cannot resist
those puppy dog eyes.

151
00:05:18,216 --> 00:05:20,185
Here.

152
00:05:20,218 --> 00:05:22,286
Ah! Now, I have time
to hit the seamstress.

153
00:05:26,274 --> 00:05:29,627
Guess all I have to say
is "Ladies and gentlemen,

154
00:05:29,661 --> 00:05:33,497
Greendale Resort and Casino
presents Steve Winwood."

155
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:35,399
Okay, I just need to find
the one last smoking gun,

156
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:36,768
and I think this might be it.

157
00:05:36,802 --> 00:05:38,970
I found it in a copy of
the Greendale communist worker.

158
00:05:38,987 --> 00:05:40,105
Look familiar?

159
00:05:40,122 --> 00:05:41,906
Oh, my God.

160
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:45,377
This is me and my anarchist
collective at the courthouse.

161
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:47,362
We called ourselves
the An-her-chists.

162
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:50,048
Did you guys know
that Jeff's in that photo?

163
00:05:50,082 --> 00:05:51,682
What!

164
00:05:51,701 --> 00:05:53,567
Jeff. My man.

165
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,153
Congrats on getting
your case thrown out.

166
00:05:55,187 --> 00:05:56,805
Your argument
was a masterpiece.

167
00:05:56,855 --> 00:05:58,757
I mean,
it was definitely creative.

168
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,358
Creative?

169
00:06:00,392 --> 00:06:02,343
He convinced a judge
to forgive five years back taxes

170
00:06:02,377 --> 00:06:03,845
by getting him to agree

171
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:05,947
that you humping an American
flag to <i>Back In Black</i>

172
00:06:05,982 --> 00:06:07,149
was not stripping

173
00:06:07,182 --> 00:06:10,084
but actually not-for-profit
performance art.

174
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:11,420
Ch-chk...Boom!

175
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,721
Blew me away.

176
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:14,021
Come on, let's go!

177
00:06:14,057 --> 00:06:15,122
Thank you.

178
00:06:15,158 --> 00:06:16,707
Thank you for defending
a woman's right

179
00:06:16,742 --> 00:06:18,576
to use her body
however she chooses.

180
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:22,113
I can honestly say that right
is very important to me.

181
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:23,197
Aw!

182
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,983
Excuse me, Mr. Winger,
can we get a--

183
00:06:25,016 --> 00:06:26,016
You're a hero.
Hi.

184
00:06:26,035 --> 00:06:27,002
Hi.

185
00:06:27,036 --> 00:06:28,286
Guys!

186
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,654
We have got
to capitalize on this momentum.

187
00:06:30,673 --> 00:06:33,024
It is time An-her-chists
finally takes a stand

188
00:06:33,058 --> 00:06:34,709
on animals rights.

189
00:06:34,744 --> 00:06:36,845
There is a medical lab
in an office building nearby.

190
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:38,779
Next week,
I say we break in there--

191
00:06:38,814 --> 00:06:40,749
Actually, we were thinking
this is our last hurrah.

192
00:06:40,783 --> 00:06:42,533
But this was our first hurrah.

193
00:06:42,567 --> 00:06:44,619
- We're just getting going.
- Britta, we're done.

194
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,004
I had a hamburger
the other day,

195
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:47,404
and suddenly I'm not cold
all the time.

196
00:06:47,423 --> 00:06:51,343
Fine. Go.
I don't need you.

197
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:55,629
What's an anarchist to do
without her organization?

198
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:59,617
Jeffrey, how could you?

199
00:06:59,651 --> 00:07:01,012
Well, I was
a really good lawyer.

200
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:03,588
Mysti is the stripper
that Andre cheated on me with,

201
00:07:03,605 --> 00:07:05,473
and you defended her.

202
00:07:05,524 --> 00:07:07,257
Shirley, I--

203
00:07:07,276 --> 00:07:08,927
If you hadn't gotten
that homewrecker off,

204
00:07:08,944 --> 00:07:11,196
Andre never would've met her.

205
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,711
Jeff ends Shirley's marriage.

206
00:07:13,831 --> 00:07:15,934
See? I told you
we were always destined to meet.

207
00:07:15,951 --> 00:07:16,867
Hmm.

208
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,276
Usually Jeff went to the same rec center,

209
00:07:20,317 --> 00:07:21,673
but I had no idea
their paths crossed again.

210
00:07:21,913 --> 00:07:23,113
This is good.
This is really great.

211
00:07:23,149 --> 00:07:24,432
We're really filling in
some plot holes here.

212
00:07:24,466 --> 00:07:25,750
This is good stuff.
It's really good.

213
00:07:25,785 --> 00:07:27,000
Have I missed something?

214
00:07:27,036 --> 00:07:29,220
These aren't plot holes, Abed.
This is my life.

215
00:07:29,254 --> 00:07:30,404
But this kinda connection

216
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:31,673
only makes our origin story
more compelling.

217
00:07:31,706 --> 00:07:33,091
Like how awesome it is

218
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,175
when Uncle Ben is murdered
in <i>Spider-Man.</i>

219
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:35,593
- Hmm.
- My marriage almost ended.

220
00:07:35,627 --> 00:07:36,778
If it weren't for Jeff,

221
00:07:36,812 --> 00:07:38,346
that Jezebel
would've been in jail

222
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,814
instead of between
my Laura Ashley sheets.

223
00:07:39,848 --> 00:07:42,132
Hey, this is not my fault.

224
00:07:42,168 --> 00:07:43,317
And by the way,

225
00:07:43,351 --> 00:07:44,853
the case didn't work out
too great for me either.

226
00:07:44,887 --> 00:07:46,704
It was supposed to make
my career,

227
00:07:46,738 --> 00:07:48,355
but it put a target on my back.

228
00:07:52,211 --> 00:07:54,178
Michael Phelps, really?

229
00:07:54,213 --> 00:07:55,562
And it doesn't affect
his breathing?

230
00:07:55,598 --> 00:07:57,014
Nope.

231
00:07:57,048 --> 00:07:58,766
Mysti, can I talk to Jeff
for a moment?

232
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,870
I will go, uh, powder my nose.

233
00:08:02,904 --> 00:08:05,423
For real.

234
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:06,725
Listen.

235
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:08,543
There's this rumor
going around the firm

236
00:08:08,576 --> 00:08:10,829
that you never received
an undergraduate degree.

237
00:08:10,862 --> 00:08:13,098
- That's ridiculous.
- I know.

238
00:08:13,132 --> 00:08:16,033
I mean, some jag is obviously
jealous of your rising star.

239
00:08:16,067 --> 00:08:18,168
But the fact is,
until this is settled,

240
00:08:18,202 --> 00:08:20,637
the bar isn't gonna
let you practice.

241
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:25,143
So you got caught
in your own lie?

242
00:08:25,177 --> 00:08:26,845
I almost lost my family.

243
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,896
How does your little tragedy
even compare?

244
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:30,548
Because I had to go
to school here.

245
00:08:30,582 --> 00:08:31,800
Abed, do not write that down.

246
00:08:31,834 --> 00:08:34,067
It's not like
I made Andre cheat.

247
00:08:34,102 --> 00:08:36,638
Well, I happen to think it's
cool that we're all connected,

248
00:08:36,672 --> 00:08:38,255
even if some of it's
in bad ways.

249
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:39,941
I mean, I'm finally willing
to forgive Annie

250
00:08:39,975 --> 00:08:41,408
for ruining high school.

251
00:08:41,443 --> 00:08:43,677
Wait, I ruined <i>your</i> time
in high school?

252
00:08:43,711 --> 00:08:46,047
Yeah, you did.

253
00:08:47,817 --> 00:08:49,750
- You guys doing keg stands?
- Yeah!

254
00:08:49,784 --> 00:08:51,970
Anyone can do a keg stand.

255
00:08:52,004 --> 00:08:53,270
I'm gonna do a keg flip.

256
00:08:53,304 --> 00:08:55,173
Hey, everybody, look at this.

257
00:08:59,845 --> 00:09:01,229
Ah!

258
00:09:01,263 --> 00:09:03,130
Oh!

259
00:09:03,164 --> 00:09:05,182
Oh, my football knee!
Why!

260
00:09:05,216 --> 00:09:06,183
Can I have some corn nuts?

261
00:09:06,201 --> 00:09:09,803
Wah!
No! Nooooo!

262
00:09:12,091 --> 00:09:13,524
That had nothing to do with me.

263
00:09:13,558 --> 00:09:15,442
And you already admitted
that you faked that injury

264
00:09:15,477 --> 00:09:16,845
because you couldn't
take the pressure

265
00:09:16,895 --> 00:09:18,196
of those football recruiters.

266
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,548
I faked my injury
because of what you said to me.

267
00:09:20,582 --> 00:09:21,966
Because of what I said?

268
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,201
You didn't even remember
that I went to school with you.

269
00:09:24,202 --> 00:09:26,653
I may have lied about that too.

270
00:09:29,508 --> 00:09:32,509
Hey, guys, it's time to do
senior class superlatives!

271
00:09:34,996 --> 00:09:38,265
Okay, the first award
is "Most Handsome."

272
00:09:38,299 --> 00:09:39,967
And the winner is...

273
00:09:40,001 --> 00:09:43,136
- Troy Barnes.
- Of course it is.

274
00:09:43,172 --> 00:09:44,389
"Most Popular."

275
00:09:44,423 --> 00:09:46,356
Troy Barnes.

276
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,809
No! You guys are awesome.

277
00:09:48,844 --> 00:09:49,911
"Best Smile."

278
00:09:51,028 --> 00:09:52,614
Ha ha, gotta keep 'em white.

279
00:09:52,648 --> 00:09:56,518
"Best Moves."
"Best Practical Joker."

280
00:09:56,568 --> 00:09:58,036
"Coolest Locker."

281
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:00,053
And now, the last award
of the night.

282
00:10:00,089 --> 00:10:02,557
"Most Likely to Succeed."

283
00:10:02,607 --> 00:10:04,174
Okay, this has to go to me,

284
00:10:04,192 --> 00:10:05,809
because I am most likely
to succeed.

285
00:10:05,845 --> 00:10:07,477
It's just a fact.
You guys know.

286
00:10:07,495 --> 00:10:10,048
And the winner is...

287
00:10:10,081 --> 00:10:11,265
Troy Barnes.

288
00:10:16,087 --> 00:10:17,838
You have got to be kidding me!

289
00:10:17,889 --> 00:10:21,442
Troy Barnes,
most likely to succeed?

290
00:10:21,476 --> 00:10:24,928
I'm the damn Valedictorian
and head of student council

291
00:10:24,963 --> 00:10:27,715
and president of campus
crusade for Christ.

292
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,865
And I'm Jewish!

293
00:10:28,884 --> 00:10:32,086
And you are just
some mindless robot.

294
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,621
You just go wherever
they tell you to run.

295
00:10:34,657 --> 00:10:37,674
I'm sorry.

296
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,793
Do you go to my school?

297
00:10:39,827 --> 00:10:42,746
Oh!

298
00:10:49,221 --> 00:10:51,556
Pop! Pop!

299
00:10:52,774 --> 00:10:54,174
Your words cut me

300
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:56,760
more than hundreds of
non-tempered glass shards could.

301
00:10:56,778 --> 00:11:00,280
I had six different
reconstructive surgeries.

302
00:11:00,316 --> 00:11:01,765
I went through withdrawal.

303
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:05,003
I had to smile
when I didn't feel like smiling.

304
00:11:05,037 --> 00:11:06,386
That hurts my face.

305
00:11:06,422 --> 00:11:08,221
Can we all just stop
dredging up the past?

306
00:11:08,256 --> 00:11:10,006
The only thing
your fate web thing does

307
00:11:10,024 --> 00:11:12,793
is point out how fragile
our happiness is.

308
00:11:12,827 --> 00:11:15,330
If only Jeff hadn't defended
that woman,

309
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,181
if only Andre hadn't met her
after I left the restaurant,

310
00:11:17,216 --> 00:11:19,033
if only I didn't have to pick up
my kids at the mall, I--

311
00:11:19,067 --> 00:11:20,301
Wait.

312
00:11:20,336 --> 00:11:23,086
When? Which mall?

313
00:11:24,572 --> 00:11:26,673
Oh, my God.

314
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:28,625
Oh, my God.

315
00:11:32,163 --> 00:11:33,530
Hey, what movie
you guys gonna see?

316
00:11:33,565 --> 00:11:35,899
<i>The Phantom Menace.</i>
<i>It's kind of old.</i>

317
00:11:35,918 --> 00:11:37,351
And why
do you wanna see it?

318
00:11:37,385 --> 00:11:38,720
Because we like <i>Star Wars.</i>

319
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:40,138
Okay, if you like <i>Star Wars,</i>

320
00:11:40,172 --> 00:11:41,673
why do you wanna murder it
and urinate on its grave?

321
00:11:41,706 --> 00:11:42,907
The prequels are terrible.

322
00:11:42,941 --> 00:11:44,241
I mean, seriously,
wouldn't Chewbacca,

323
00:11:44,275 --> 00:11:46,244
at some point, go,
"Hey, Yoda, I know that guy"?

324
00:11:46,278 --> 00:11:48,044
He has double light sabers.

325
00:11:48,062 --> 00:11:49,563
That's stupid.
You're both stupid.

326
00:11:49,597 --> 00:11:51,665
Well, why are you here
to see the movie?

327
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,917
I'm not.

328
00:11:52,951 --> 00:11:54,751
I go wherever it plays
to warn people.

329
00:11:54,787 --> 00:11:56,104
You've been warned.

330
00:11:59,524 --> 00:12:02,293
Stranger said what to him?

331
00:12:02,326 --> 00:12:04,861
Okay, fine.
I'll come get you.

332
00:12:04,897 --> 00:12:07,148
I'm sorry, baby,
I'll be back as soon as I can.

333
00:12:07,198 --> 00:12:09,951
Okay, just stand there, okay?

334
00:12:09,985 --> 00:12:12,253
This can't be.

335
00:12:12,287 --> 00:12:14,422
I don't see why
I have to go to a therapist.

336
00:12:14,472 --> 00:12:16,506
Because after that woman
chewed them out for three hours,

337
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:19,059
the theater got
a restraining order against you.

338
00:12:19,094 --> 00:12:20,662
<i>Yalla.</i>

339
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,048
Hey, doc.
By the way,

340
00:12:24,082 --> 00:12:26,082
someone just stole
your prescription pad.

341
00:12:28,537 --> 00:12:29,886
I'm trying to liberate you!

342
00:12:29,922 --> 00:12:31,621
Ow!

343
00:12:33,725 --> 00:12:35,610
You're the crazy man
at the mall!

344
00:12:35,644 --> 00:12:37,711
You're the one who got me
busted for drugs!

345
00:12:37,745 --> 00:12:40,682
You were out there somewhere
and you weren't looking for me?

346
00:12:40,732 --> 00:12:42,649
In fairness, Annie,

347
00:12:42,701 --> 00:12:45,061
running through a glass door
might've been the drug tip-off.

348
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,303
All this time,
I wondered what it was

349
00:12:46,337 --> 00:12:48,639
that brought our group
together.

350
00:12:48,673 --> 00:12:50,307
But I forgot one thing
all heroes need.

351
00:12:50,341 --> 00:12:51,576
They need an enemy.

352
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:52,744
Batman has the Joker,

353
00:12:52,778 --> 00:12:54,511
the Justice League
has the Legion of Doom,

354
00:12:54,546 --> 00:12:57,532
and this study group...
has me.

355
00:12:57,566 --> 00:12:59,950
I'm the supervillain.
Why didn't I see it before?

356
00:12:59,967 --> 00:13:01,985
I'm emotionless, logical,
smarter than everybody else.

357
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,855
- Hey!
- I tried sawing off

358
00:13:03,889 --> 00:13:05,405
- Jeff's arm.
- Why do you keep saying that?

359
00:13:05,456 --> 00:13:07,008
I should go.
It's not safe to be around me.

360
00:13:07,042 --> 00:13:08,259
I'm just as bad.

361
00:13:08,293 --> 00:13:09,760
I couldn't handle the monkey,

362
00:13:09,794 --> 00:13:11,778
so I traded it in
for a glaucoma brownie,

363
00:13:11,813 --> 00:13:13,914
even though I knew
if it bit someone,

364
00:13:13,948 --> 00:13:16,116
it would make them
a teensy bit psychotic.

365
00:13:16,168 --> 00:13:18,186
Britta's right.

366
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,937
We've all made
some bad decisions.

367
00:13:19,971 --> 00:13:22,155
And if you really wanna know
who the villain is here,

368
00:13:22,191 --> 00:13:24,258
it's me.

369
00:13:26,729 --> 00:13:28,879
- Ah.
- Weee!

370
00:13:28,897 --> 00:13:30,447
Yeesh, I didn't think
it was possible

371
00:13:30,481 --> 00:13:31,832
to put more glitter on.

372
00:13:31,866 --> 00:13:33,201
It's coming off of you
like Pig-Pen.

373
00:13:33,251 --> 00:13:35,720
Well, some people
seem to like it.

374
00:13:35,754 --> 00:13:38,072
This married guy just gave me
his phone number.

375
00:13:38,123 --> 00:13:39,573
Can you believe
his wife left him

376
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:40,908
on their anniversary?

377
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,225
You gonna call him?

378
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,394
I mean, he did just win
a bunch of money.

379
00:13:43,428 --> 00:13:44,695
I don't know though.

380
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,290
You don't know what?
You're not married.

381
00:13:46,331 --> 00:13:48,165
You gotta grab what you want
in this life.

382
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,033
That's the way it works.

383
00:13:50,052 --> 00:13:52,220
Someone just took
something important from me.

384
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,788
And you know what?

385
00:13:53,822 --> 00:13:55,773
I admire him for it.

386
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,825
All right, I mean,
I guess I'll go talk to him.

387
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,059
You do that.

388
00:13:59,094 --> 00:14:00,227
And I'm gonna go get

389
00:14:00,261 --> 00:14:01,946
"crap on other people's lawns"
drunk.

390
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:05,099
To a memorable evening
for both of us.

391
00:14:08,086 --> 00:14:10,270
Maybe you coincidentally
affected some of us.

392
00:14:10,304 --> 00:14:13,256
But I actively endorsed pain.

393
00:14:13,274 --> 00:14:15,643
I was the bad guy, and...

394
00:14:15,677 --> 00:14:19,246
I'd like to think
I'm not that guy anymore.

395
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,999
Also, and I hate
to bring this up,

396
00:14:22,033 --> 00:14:23,918
you did once make me
pee myself.

397
00:14:23,951 --> 00:14:27,403
Well, I guess we're even then.

398
00:14:27,422 --> 00:14:29,373
I might finish studying
at home.

399
00:14:37,599 --> 00:14:38,982
Just ten minutes ago,

400
00:14:39,017 --> 00:14:41,918
I would've been so excited
about that peeing thing.

401
00:14:54,386 --> 00:14:57,163
I wanted to make a prequel
and I ruined everything.

402
00:14:58,168 --> 00:14:59,586
I guess it could happen to anyone.

403
00:15:00,019 --> 00:15:01,854
I should probably write
George Lucas a note of apology.

404
00:15:01,889 --> 00:15:04,106
Okay, let's not get crazy.

405
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,392
And you didn't ruin anything.

406
00:15:06,427 --> 00:15:08,695
May I sit here?

407
00:15:08,729 --> 00:15:10,495
Shirley,
what are you doing here?

408
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:13,682
Oh, just wanted some yogurt.

409
00:15:13,716 --> 00:15:16,702
And I do know
you're not that person anymore.

410
00:15:16,736 --> 00:15:19,105
Are you sure?
'Cause I was awfully good at it.

411
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:21,073
Well, we all do bad things
every now and again.

412
00:15:21,107 --> 00:15:23,125
I mean, I put a stripper's head
through a jukebox.

413
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:24,259
Hmm.

414
00:15:24,293 --> 00:15:26,796
What are you guys doing here?

415
00:15:29,133 --> 00:15:31,267
I guess we all
really wanted yogurt.

416
00:15:31,301 --> 00:15:33,134
You know what's weird?

417
00:15:33,153 --> 00:15:35,303
This is where I first decided
to go to Greendale.

418
00:15:35,338 --> 00:15:37,539
Wait, really?

419
00:15:37,557 --> 00:15:40,659
This is where I was when I first
decided to go to Greendale.

420
00:15:40,693 --> 00:15:43,879
You're kidding me.

421
00:15:43,913 --> 00:15:46,215
Senor Chang, I know you're
as disappointed as I am

422
00:15:46,249 --> 00:15:48,467
in the caliber of students
we have at Greendale.

423
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:52,038
But the mall offers a whole new
valuable demographic

424
00:15:52,072 --> 00:15:54,072
of people awake
during the daytime.

425
00:15:54,124 --> 00:15:55,957
All right, I'll pass flyers
at Yogurtsburgh.

426
00:15:55,991 --> 00:15:57,326
Self-serve yogurt.

427
00:15:57,344 --> 00:15:59,428
Those douses already know
one marketable skill.

428
00:15:59,462 --> 00:16:00,812
Okay, Ben--

429
00:16:00,864 --> 00:16:02,315
But it still has the tags on!

430
00:16:02,365 --> 00:16:04,283
So I lost the receipt.

431
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:05,684
It's not like I even got
to wear it,

432
00:16:05,719 --> 00:16:08,221
because my husband's
a tasteless man slut.

433
00:16:08,272 --> 00:16:11,791
What hey, littering!

434
00:16:16,413 --> 00:16:18,480
This better not
awaken anything in me.

435
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,191
God, this day...

436
00:16:28,225 --> 00:16:29,759
I thought pushing that woman's
head through a jukebox

437
00:16:29,826 --> 00:16:31,527
would make me feel better,
but I'm just...

438
00:16:31,528 --> 00:16:33,546
out of $54...

439
00:16:33,596 --> 00:16:34,831
and a marriage.

440
00:16:34,865 --> 00:16:37,066
<i>Crystal Skull</i> was aliens,

441
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,951
so it's a pretty great film.

442
00:16:45,075 --> 00:16:46,576
You guys seen this?

443
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:50,312
Guys, working the program
with you has been so great.

444
00:16:50,346 --> 00:16:54,917
I feel like I'm finally ready
to get my life back on track.

445
00:16:54,951 --> 00:16:56,085
Last chance.

446
00:16:56,102 --> 00:16:57,602
Just walk over there right now

447
00:16:57,638 --> 00:16:59,404
and apologize
to the theater manager.

448
00:16:59,456 --> 00:17:02,174
Midichlorians.

449
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,493
Midichlorians!

450
00:17:03,527 --> 00:17:04,644
Fine.

451
00:17:04,694 --> 00:17:06,528
Then you're not going
to film school!

452
00:17:08,397 --> 00:17:10,799
Hi!
Do you have any vegan froyo?

453
00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:12,652
Do you even know what froyo is?

454
00:17:12,685 --> 00:17:15,121
Fine. Do you have
a job application?

455
00:17:15,154 --> 00:17:16,521
Hey.

456
00:17:16,557 --> 00:17:19,174
That weird guy
hasn't blinked once.

457
00:17:19,192 --> 00:17:22,111
Oh, yeah.

458
00:17:22,128 --> 00:17:24,246
What a dweeb.

459
00:17:24,263 --> 00:17:25,448
Yeah, what a dweeb.

460
00:17:25,481 --> 00:17:28,049
Oh, nice shot, man!

461
00:17:30,453 --> 00:17:31,820
Hey, do you work at Greendale?

462
00:17:31,855 --> 00:17:33,405
Work? That's putting it
charitably.

463
00:17:33,457 --> 00:17:35,624
Greendale community college
is a total joke.

464
00:17:35,642 --> 00:17:38,361
They'd give a degree
to a monkey.

465
00:17:38,394 --> 00:17:42,531
Hey, does Ian Duncan still
teach psychology at Greendale?

466
00:17:42,566 --> 00:17:44,016
- That drunken limey?
- That's the one.

467
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:45,484
He's got tenure.

468
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:47,638
Maybe getting my degree
won't be as hard as I thought.

469
00:17:49,807 --> 00:17:52,275
Sir, what are you doing?

470
00:17:52,308 --> 00:17:54,143
Can we get some help out here?

471
00:17:54,161 --> 00:17:56,520
Some old guy broke the machine
and is faking a heart attack.

472
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:01,867
Oh, wait.

473
00:18:01,902 --> 00:18:03,736
Ah, stupid.

474
00:18:13,297 --> 00:18:14,763
Cool, cool, cool.

475
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:17,583
Wait, so was that old guy
really Pierce?

476
00:18:17,617 --> 00:18:20,368
We'll never know, because
he'll never ever remember.

477
00:18:20,386 --> 00:18:22,387
What are the chances
of all of us

478
00:18:22,439 --> 00:18:25,473
ending up at the same place
at the same time twice?

479
00:18:25,491 --> 00:18:26,791
Abed, it's amazing.

480
00:18:26,826 --> 00:18:28,294
I mean, yes,
2008 was the height

481
00:18:28,345 --> 00:18:30,946
of the slightly sour
frozen yogurt craze, but...

482
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,847
that still doesn't explain it.

483
00:18:32,865 --> 00:18:35,451
Maybe we really were
all meant to be together.

484
00:18:35,484 --> 00:18:40,288
I'm not sure I understand it,
but maybe we don't have to.

485
00:18:40,324 --> 00:18:43,291
What I do know is that
the ways our paths crossed,

486
00:18:43,326 --> 00:18:47,829
even when they were bad,
all led us to this point.

487
00:18:47,865 --> 00:18:50,383
And I wouldn't have it
any other way.

488
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:51,917
So what you're saying

489
00:18:51,951 --> 00:18:53,535
is that we're all each other's
Uncle Ben's murder.

490
00:18:53,554 --> 00:18:55,555
And we're all Spider-Men.

491
00:18:55,605 --> 00:18:57,606
Yeah.

492
00:18:57,641 --> 00:18:58,941
Let's say I'm saying that.

493
00:18:58,976 --> 00:19:02,127
Mm, I think we know
whose will this really is.

494
00:19:02,179 --> 00:19:04,763
Yeah, I think I do.

495
00:19:04,815 --> 00:19:06,231
I'll be right back.

496
00:19:11,571 --> 00:19:13,673
Hello?

497
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:18,443
Hey, Abed.

498
00:19:18,478 --> 00:19:21,263
Just doing
some Pilates.

499
00:19:21,298 --> 00:19:23,002
- I was looking for you.
- Wha--I--

500
00:19:23,123 --> 00:19:25,951
We discovered you're the
reason we all went to Greendale.

501
00:19:25,986 --> 00:19:27,603
You linked all of our stories.

502
00:19:27,637 --> 00:19:29,518
Like how the Cosmic Cube
assembled the Avengers.

503
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,739
That, and the 4-billion-dollar
deal with Disney.

504
00:19:31,858 --> 00:19:34,309
Turns out
you were always one of us.

505
00:19:34,344 --> 00:19:37,546
So I came to see if you wanted
to get some frozen yogurt.

506
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,192
Really?

507
00:19:39,438 --> 00:19:42,077
That's--

508
00:19:42,198 --> 00:19:45,731
that's all I ever wanted.

509
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:47,545
But it's too late.

510
00:19:47,981 --> 00:19:49,537
Here's another thing
I realized.

511
00:19:49,836 --> 00:19:52,760
Because of you we got to
reinvent ourselves at Greendale.

512
00:19:52,881 --> 00:19:55,181
Everyone should have the
same chance, don't you think...

513
00:19:55,214 --> 00:19:57,215
- Chang?
- It's not Chang.

514
00:19:57,267 --> 00:20:01,069
It's Kevin.

515
00:20:01,104 --> 00:20:03,638
How long have you known?

516
00:20:03,673 --> 00:20:05,083
Known what?

517
00:20:05,355 --> 00:20:08,544
Only you know
who you really are.

518
00:20:08,577 --> 00:20:11,396
Also, you may have
experimental monkey fever.

519
00:20:11,448 --> 00:20:13,031
You coming?

520
00:20:16,819 --> 00:20:18,532
Yeah.

521
00:20:22,778 --> 00:20:24,497
Actually, can we stop
at the post office first?

522
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:25,948
I have something to mail
for the Dean.

523
00:20:25,999 --> 00:20:27,732
It's confidential
and I don't wanna talk about it,

524
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,251
so stop interrogating me.

525
00:20:32,779 --> 00:20:33,911
I'm out.

526
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:37,804
You're too in to be out.

527
00:20:41,066 --> 00:20:42,567
- Hey!
- Hi!

528
00:20:42,601 --> 00:20:44,484
You want some refills?
On me, huh?

529
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:45,819
Refills?
You want some?

530
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:46,869
_

531
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,125
_

532
00:20:49,067 --> 00:20:51,140
Time for plan "B".

533
00:21:02,823 --> 00:21:09,660
