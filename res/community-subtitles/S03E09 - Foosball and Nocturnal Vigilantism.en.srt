1
00:00:05,121 --> 00:00:07,623
Happy Friday, everybody.
What are you doing this weekend?

2
00:00:07,658 --> 00:00:11,160
The question is,
<i>who</i> am I doing this weekend?

3
00:00:11,195 --> 00:00:13,096
He's asking because
he's already forgotten.

4
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:14,696
It's nobody.

5
00:00:14,731 --> 00:00:16,332
I'm volunteering
at the animal hospital.

6
00:00:16,367 --> 00:00:17,432
- Aw.
- Animal hospital?

7
00:00:17,468 --> 00:00:18,867
The animals are the patients.

8
00:00:18,902 --> 00:00:20,103
That makes sense.

9
00:00:20,137 --> 00:00:21,937
Yeah, Dr. Zizmor's
letting me work off

10
00:00:21,972 --> 00:00:23,638
the cost
of Daniel's eye surgery.

11
00:00:23,657 --> 00:00:25,490
Wait. You won't spend money
on a name-brand phone,

12
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,376
but you got lasik
for your geriatric cat?

13
00:00:27,411 --> 00:00:29,512
He only has the one eye, Jeff.

14
00:00:29,547 --> 00:00:32,148
I can't exactly buy him
a cat monocle, can I?

15
00:00:32,182 --> 00:00:33,383
It's pretentious.

16
00:00:33,417 --> 00:00:36,018
And for your information,
this is a totorola.

17
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:42,192
Troy and I will be having
a very special Saturday night,

18
00:00:42,225 --> 00:00:44,159
as in <i>Dark Knight.</i>

19
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:48,030
It came! Our limited-edition,
$299 <i>Dark Knight</i> DVD

20
00:00:48,064 --> 00:00:49,164
with bonus footage,
special commentary,

21
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:50,665
and a Christian Bale autograph,

22
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:53,686
including a personalized message
of up to four words!

23
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,106
"Abed is Batman now,
Christian Bale."

24
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,475
- It's official.
- From the man himself.

25
00:00:59,509 --> 00:01:00,893
May I have that back, Annie?
Thank you.

26
00:01:00,945 --> 00:01:02,395
And just to clarify,
if you see this lying out,

27
00:01:02,445 --> 00:01:03,780
I'm still using it,
so you don't have

28
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:05,180
to take it to the kitchen,
dump it out, and wash the bowl.

29
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:06,516
Is this about
your buttered noodles?

30
00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:08,567
I didn't say that.

31
00:01:08,618 --> 00:01:11,236
- Yes!
- Into your face!

32
00:01:11,287 --> 00:01:13,355
Your tears reveal
your weakness!

33
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:15,090
What is it
with those tools and foosball?

34
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:17,060
- They've been at it for weeks.
- I think they're European.

35
00:01:17,093 --> 00:01:18,912
It's probably a more important
game over there.

36
00:01:18,962 --> 00:01:20,129
Foosball's like the soccer
of ping-pong.

37
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,882
- I can't take it anymore.
- Oh, Jeffrey, let them be.

38
00:01:23,918 --> 00:01:26,551
Gentlemen, my name
is Clarence Thaddeus Foos.

39
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,670
My grandfather,
Fletcher Morton Foos,

40
00:01:28,706 --> 00:01:31,007
invented this game
for one purpose--

41
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,308
to have the loudest,
dumbest thing happen.

42
00:01:36,579 --> 00:01:37,780
You're free to return

43
00:01:37,814 --> 00:01:39,915
to your undoubtedly
hearing-impaired families.

44
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:43,620
Tell you what,
we'll stop playing,

45
00:01:43,653 --> 00:01:45,354
if you can score a point on us.

46
00:01:45,389 --> 00:01:48,091
Tempting, but then wouldn't
I be playing foosball?

47
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:51,894
And, if so, how would I not
be a loud, weird knob?

48
00:01:51,929 --> 00:01:53,195
Free shot.

49
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:55,430
I'm not even touching
the foosenschaften.

50
00:01:55,466 --> 00:01:58,918
Sorry, luftballons.
I'm above it.

51
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:01,870
Boo-yah!

52
00:02:01,905 --> 00:02:05,007
I wish there was a word
to describe the pleasure I feel

53
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:06,308
at viewing misfortune.

54
00:02:06,343 --> 00:02:08,627
'Tis the face of a broken man.

55
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:10,513
Jeff. Smile.

56
00:02:10,546 --> 00:02:12,048
- Uh, uh...
- Ooh!

57
00:02:12,081 --> 00:02:14,082
They, uh, --
they come in a six-pack.

65
00:02:44,448 --> 00:02:46,783
Oh--

66
00:02:46,817 --> 00:02:48,334
Buttered noodles.

67
00:02:51,155 --> 00:02:54,807
I'm allowed to throw out
the dust, right?

68
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,792
Yeah.

69
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:19,782
What's wrong?

70
00:03:19,817 --> 00:03:23,151
I-I...

71
00:03:26,657 --> 00:03:27,622
Why?

72
00:03:27,658 --> 00:03:29,341
- I stepped on it.
- Why?

73
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,993
- I was dusting the tv.
- Why?

74
00:03:32,028 --> 00:03:33,846
I can run out and get
a new one before he gets home.

75
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:34,930
Oh, sure, Annie.

76
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:36,765
And--and then we just have
to record

77
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,602
fake exclusive commentary
by Christian Bale.

78
00:03:39,635 --> 00:03:40,887
Go ahead, you first.

79
00:03:40,937 --> 00:03:42,771
This scene
was a special challenge

80
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,039
- to all involved--
- Stop it!

81
00:03:44,074 --> 00:03:45,474
That's not a real option!

82
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:47,509
The disc
is irreplaceably awesome!

83
00:03:47,543 --> 00:03:49,677
What if we got
a different disc, and--

84
00:03:49,695 --> 00:03:51,848
Annie, do you know
how many sitcoms

85
00:03:51,882 --> 00:03:54,866
have done the "secretly replace
a broken, priceless item" thing?

86
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,551
'Cause Abed does.

87
00:03:56,586 --> 00:03:58,621
Abed knows everything,

88
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,573
and I know you think you
can think your way out of this

89
00:04:00,623 --> 00:04:04,860
with your "thinkiness,"
but don't think too much.

90
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:06,729
You just have to confess.

91
00:04:06,764 --> 00:04:09,414
- Okay?
- Okay.

92
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,891
We shot this scene on location--

93
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:21,843
Okay, he's right. It won't work.

94
00:04:27,117 --> 00:04:29,886
Jeffrey?
What--what are you doing?

95
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,069
Hmm? Oh.

96
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:32,605
You know, I just thought...

97
00:04:32,656 --> 00:04:34,824
Next time those deutsche-bags
try to show off,

98
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,391
maybe I can catch them
by surprise.

99
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:39,028
Jeff, you don't need to worry
what foreigners think about you.

100
00:04:39,062 --> 00:04:41,430
That's your birthright
as an American.

101
00:04:41,465 --> 00:04:44,617
Okay...

102
00:04:44,668 --> 00:04:46,769
Small confession.

103
00:04:46,803 --> 00:04:48,403
I used to love foosball.

104
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:50,540
It was a great
after-school game

105
00:04:50,574 --> 00:04:52,942
for a lonely kid
with no dad--

106
00:04:52,975 --> 00:04:54,427
you know, just masculine enough

107
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,211
without having to know
how to throw or catch.

108
00:04:56,245 --> 00:04:57,579
I have seen you throw.

109
00:04:57,613 --> 00:04:59,281
And it was fun...

110
00:04:59,316 --> 00:05:02,718
Till I started getting bullied
by people like those Germans.

111
00:05:02,752 --> 00:05:04,153
So I quit.

112
00:05:04,187 --> 00:05:06,555
Well, you did the right thing.

113
00:05:06,589 --> 00:05:10,393
Foosball is a vile game
for vile people.

114
00:05:10,427 --> 00:05:12,360
Shirley, you wouldn't get it.
It's a guy thing.

115
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:14,564
It's not
a fresh-baked-pie thing.

116
00:05:14,598 --> 00:05:17,733
Well, I might get it a little.

117
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,784
You don't know me.

118
00:05:37,721 --> 00:05:42,358
Ho...Ly...Crap.

119
00:05:42,391 --> 00:05:44,293
All right, I think I figured
out the viewing order--

120
00:05:44,327 --> 00:05:46,394
original version,
director's cut,

121
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,497
director's cut with commentary,

122
00:05:47,531 --> 00:05:49,564
and then original version
cool-down.

123
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,002
- Yeah, we'll see.
- Mm-hmm.

124
00:05:53,036 --> 00:05:55,471
Oh, my God, you guys.

125
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:57,139
We've been robbed!

126
00:05:59,175 --> 00:06:00,942
Oh, man.

127
00:06:00,978 --> 00:06:04,079
I can't believe we got robbed.

128
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,865
Shirley, Shirley.

129
00:06:05,915 --> 00:06:07,165
You have to teach me.

130
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:09,351
Please, help me beat
those evil power krauts.

131
00:06:09,386 --> 00:06:11,086
Don't you get it, Jeff?

132
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,589
They're not evil people
that are good at foosball.

133
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:17,560
They are good at foosball
because they're evil.

134
00:06:17,593 --> 00:06:20,062
It's an evil game
that brings out the worst in us,

135
00:06:20,096 --> 00:06:22,064
like--like out-of-town weddings
where the reception's

136
00:06:22,098 --> 00:06:23,499
in the same place
as everybody's rooms?

137
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:26,302
Great. After three years
of religious advice

138
00:06:26,336 --> 00:06:27,569
and carb-laden pastries,

139
00:06:27,603 --> 00:06:30,839
you finally have one thing
I actually need, and--

140
00:06:30,874 --> 00:06:33,408
I'm sorry.

141
00:06:33,442 --> 00:06:35,911
Um, that was rude.

142
00:06:35,946 --> 00:06:39,247
It--it shouldn't be
so important to me.

143
00:06:39,283 --> 00:06:41,367
I'll, uh...
I'll see you Monday.

144
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,187
Jeff...

145
00:06:46,223 --> 00:06:48,591
Tomorrow, dawn--

146
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:49,992
be in the student lounge.

147
00:06:50,026 --> 00:06:52,026
Shirley, you are the best.

148
00:06:57,634 --> 00:07:00,403
Dear lord, please forgive me.

149
00:07:00,437 --> 00:07:02,338
And please have mercy on him.

150
00:07:02,372 --> 00:07:04,307
The stakes
have never been higher.

151
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:05,608
Shut up, Leonard.

152
00:07:05,641 --> 00:07:06,975
I found your YouTube page.

153
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,944
What's the point
in reviewing frozen pizza?

154
00:07:08,978 --> 00:07:10,428
You're talking about it.

155
00:07:11,646 --> 00:07:13,048
Well, that is true.

156
00:07:17,543 --> 00:07:18,552
Now, Jeffrey...

157
00:07:18,903 --> 00:07:20,098
The key to winning foosball

158
00:07:20,218 --> 00:07:21,279
is to tap into your darkness,

159
00:07:21,404 --> 00:07:22,771
so I need you to promise
you won't judge

160
00:07:22,822 --> 00:07:24,456
the side of me
that might come out.

161
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:25,891
Shirley...

162
00:07:25,925 --> 00:07:27,726
I'm gonna be perfectly blunt
with you.

163
00:07:27,761 --> 00:07:30,129
The few times that
you've been a little bad

164
00:07:30,163 --> 00:07:31,264
are the times
I've liked you most.

165
00:07:31,298 --> 00:07:32,731
- Really?
- Remember making fun

166
00:07:32,766 --> 00:07:34,233
of Britta's boyfriend's
tiny nipples?

167
00:07:34,268 --> 00:07:35,901
Oh, yeah, they were tiny.

168
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,569
Remember what you did
to Pierce's hoagie?

169
00:07:37,603 --> 00:07:39,738
That was so disturbing,
I almost proposed on the spot.

170
00:07:39,773 --> 00:07:43,425
Now, come on,
show me how to dominate.

171
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:46,278
All right, Winger,
hands on the grips.

172
00:07:47,413 --> 00:07:49,115
I'm coming up
on your right side

173
00:07:49,149 --> 00:07:51,082
in three, two, one!

174
00:07:51,117 --> 00:07:52,300
You know why you can't stop me?

175
00:07:52,351 --> 00:07:53,619
'Cause I'm not playing a game.

176
00:07:53,653 --> 00:07:55,971
For you, it's winning
and losing.

177
00:07:56,023 --> 00:07:57,755
For me, it's life and death.

178
00:07:57,774 --> 00:07:58,941
That's how I win.

179
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:00,392
That's where you have to go.

180
00:08:00,427 --> 00:08:03,161
No more thought,
no more feeling.

181
00:08:03,196 --> 00:08:06,064
Kill or be killed.
Kill or be killed, little man.

182
00:08:06,098 --> 00:08:07,565
Think back
to when this game mattered,

183
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,067
before you got to be too cool.

184
00:08:09,101 --> 00:08:10,670
Stop acting like you're
not ashamed right now.

185
00:08:10,704 --> 00:08:12,654
Follow that shame to the fear.

186
00:08:12,706 --> 00:08:14,790
Follow that fear to the rage.

187
00:08:14,824 --> 00:08:17,276
You put that rage--
aah!

188
00:08:17,293 --> 00:08:19,495
Up your ass, Turkey.
Ha ha!

189
00:08:19,545 --> 00:08:22,048
There's only two ways
off this table--

190
00:08:22,081 --> 00:08:23,214
kill or be killed.

191
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,516
- Say it.
- Kill or be killed.

192
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:25,518
I said say it, mumbles!

193
00:08:25,552 --> 00:08:27,153
- Kill or be killed.
- Kill!

194
00:08:27,187 --> 00:08:28,303
- Kill!
- Kill!

195
00:08:28,338 --> 00:08:30,622
Kill!

196
00:08:30,641 --> 00:08:31,641
Yeah!

197
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,394
You called me Turkey.

198
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:39,197
I love it.

199
00:08:42,134 --> 00:08:44,937
Sorry we couldn't get a car
over here until now.

200
00:08:44,971 --> 00:08:47,173
Our captain was killed
on duty last night.

201
00:08:47,206 --> 00:08:49,442
My God, I'm so sorry.

202
00:08:49,475 --> 00:08:50,609
Yeah.
Good man--

203
00:08:50,644 --> 00:08:53,178
leaves behind two kids
and a pregnant wife.

204
00:08:53,212 --> 00:08:54,697
So you're missing a Batman DVD?

205
00:08:54,748 --> 00:08:57,383
My <i>Dark Knight</i> extended
extended cut--it wasn't insured.

206
00:08:57,417 --> 00:08:58,817
Well, there's no sign
of forced entry

207
00:08:58,835 --> 00:09:00,152
on your door or windows.

208
00:09:00,187 --> 00:09:01,519
You sure it wasn't
just misplaced?

209
00:09:01,554 --> 00:09:03,004
Someone definitely broke in.

210
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:04,456
Some of my jewelry's missing.

211
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:05,957
You sure about that, Annie?

212
00:09:05,993 --> 00:09:08,193
Mm-hmm.
My necklace.

213
00:09:08,227 --> 00:09:09,662
It was gold--
white gold--

214
00:09:09,696 --> 00:09:10,863
with emeralds.

215
00:09:10,897 --> 00:09:12,530
And my name engraved in Hebrew.

216
00:09:12,566 --> 00:09:14,133
It was a bat mitzvah gift
from my Nana.

217
00:09:14,167 --> 00:09:16,235
She was a rockette.
She married a count.

218
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:18,553
He was blind.
He loved her for her mind.

219
00:09:18,605 --> 00:09:20,005
That's good color
for the report,

220
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:21,206
but I got to be honest,

221
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,341
small stuff like this
almost never turns up.

222
00:09:23,376 --> 00:09:26,044
- Oh, no, Abed.
- We'll be in touch. Say...

223
00:09:26,078 --> 00:09:28,063
You look familiar.

224
00:09:28,115 --> 00:09:29,914
Did I ever pretend to shoot
a guy in front of you

225
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:32,084
to teach you about gun safety?

226
00:09:33,886 --> 00:09:36,554
I'm really good at faces.

227
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,740
Well, I guess
the only upside to this is

228
00:09:38,792 --> 00:09:40,326
it's brought us closer together
as roommates.

229
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,260
Something doesn't add up.

230
00:09:42,294 --> 00:09:44,330
If there was no forced entry,
it had to be an inside job.

231
00:09:44,364 --> 00:09:45,880
- We don't know that.
- And instead of taking cash,

232
00:09:45,915 --> 00:09:48,200
pharmaceuticals, laptops,
they take what?

233
00:09:48,235 --> 00:09:50,219
My Batman DVD, and one piece

234
00:09:50,253 --> 00:09:52,471
of oddly ornate
Hebrew-themed jewelry?

235
00:09:52,505 --> 00:09:53,755
- Nana gave it.
- It's smoke.

236
00:09:53,807 --> 00:09:55,256
- It's a ruse, a lie.
- Hmm?

237
00:09:55,307 --> 00:09:58,059
I think I know
what happened here.

238
00:09:58,095 --> 00:09:59,595
Abed, I--

239
00:09:59,645 --> 00:10:01,246
The landlord did it.

240
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,847
It all makes sense.

241
00:10:02,883 --> 00:10:04,417
Rick has keys
to every apartment--means.

242
00:10:04,451 --> 00:10:06,018
He knows when we're coming
and going--opportunity.

243
00:10:06,052 --> 00:10:09,788
And he was dressed as the Joker
for Halloween--motive.

244
00:10:09,822 --> 00:10:12,691
- Hmm.
- Something's got to be done.

245
00:10:12,725 --> 00:10:14,576
Oh, let's not leap
to thing-doing.

246
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:17,028
Right, Annie?

247
00:10:21,067 --> 00:10:22,734
Double strike.

248
00:10:22,753 --> 00:10:23,753
Got it.

249
00:10:23,787 --> 00:10:25,071
Back blast.

250
00:10:25,105 --> 00:10:26,072
Boom!

251
00:10:26,105 --> 00:10:27,105
Viper shot.

252
00:10:28,508 --> 00:10:30,408
- Nailed it!
- Oh, look...

253
00:10:30,427 --> 00:10:32,610
How cute--
you do like foosball,

254
00:10:32,645 --> 00:10:34,580
you just have to practice
with your mama.

255
00:10:34,614 --> 00:10:36,381
What are you guys doing here
on a Saturday night?

256
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,049
Shouldn't you be making
weird art movies

257
00:10:38,085 --> 00:10:40,152
- or well-engineered cars?
- You take that back!

258
00:10:40,187 --> 00:10:42,087
We came to play.
Get away from our table.

259
00:10:42,121 --> 00:10:43,655
- We're using it, strudel-brain.
- Nice.

260
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:44,657
Then play us for it.

261
00:10:44,691 --> 00:10:47,025
Fine.
Monday morning--

262
00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:48,626
only let's make it interesting.

263
00:10:48,662 --> 00:10:50,528
The losers never get to use
this table again.

264
00:10:50,563 --> 00:10:53,065
Oh, you are so on
that things have now

265
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,267
become very much like
<i>Donkey Kong.</i>

266
00:10:55,302 --> 00:10:56,969
We're gonna kick das butt.

267
00:10:57,003 --> 00:10:57,970
- Nice.
- Thank you.

268
00:10:58,004 --> 00:10:59,904
Enough teutonic punnery.

269
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:03,708
Monday morning you get this...

270
00:11:05,044 --> 00:11:07,913
Were you guys walking around
with a soccer ball

271
00:11:07,947 --> 00:11:10,381
just so you could do that?

272
00:11:10,417 --> 00:11:13,418
They left the ball
and everything.

273
00:11:13,452 --> 00:11:15,488
I think they were literally
walking around with it

274
00:11:15,522 --> 00:11:17,423
like a prop to use.

275
00:11:17,456 --> 00:11:20,225
That's, like, a $25 dollar bit,
and it's not even that good.

276
00:11:22,345 --> 00:11:23,895
You have got
to come clean, okay?

277
00:11:23,929 --> 00:11:25,730
I don't know what he's doing
in there, but it feels dramatic.

278
00:11:25,764 --> 00:11:28,200
I'm sure he's already moved on
to some other obsession.

279
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,270
Oh, look, fun.

280
00:11:32,304 --> 00:11:33,971
The police are powerless.

281
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:36,475
I must take justice
into my own hands.

282
00:11:36,493 --> 00:11:39,378
Men like Rick operate
above the law.

283
00:11:39,412 --> 00:11:41,779
But there's something else
above the law...

284
00:11:41,815 --> 00:11:43,282
Bats...

285
00:11:43,316 --> 00:11:45,650
And me.

286
00:11:45,668 --> 00:11:48,003
Abed, don't do
anything drastic.

287
00:11:48,038 --> 00:11:50,489
Yeah, maybe we should
all just take a step back and--

288
00:11:50,524 --> 00:11:53,158
Aw, is that the grappling hook
I got you for Christmas?

289
00:11:53,192 --> 00:11:54,592
The night beckons.

290
00:11:54,628 --> 00:11:56,629
Its black fingers
curl and uncurl,

291
00:11:56,663 --> 00:11:59,548
going, like,
"hey, come here."

292
00:11:59,599 --> 00:12:01,533
Abed, wait!

293
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:02,735
Wait. I did it.

294
00:12:02,769 --> 00:12:04,403
I stepped on your DVD,
and it broke,

295
00:12:04,437 --> 00:12:07,405
and I staged
a break-in to cover it up.

296
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,908
If that were true,

297
00:12:08,942 --> 00:12:10,609
you would've come forward
a long time ago.

298
00:12:10,644 --> 00:12:13,913
You're lying to keep me
out of danger.

299
00:12:13,947 --> 00:12:15,530
But there can be no peace

300
00:12:15,565 --> 00:12:18,049
while crime spits and dances
on the grave of justice

301
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,552
to the hot beats
of infectious rhythms

302
00:12:19,586 --> 00:12:22,187
of all that is wrong.

303
00:12:25,075 --> 00:12:26,591
- Oh!
- Just...

304
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,527
- Use your foot.
- Ooh, ooh, ooh!

305
00:12:28,562 --> 00:12:30,028
You're okay--okay.

306
00:12:30,046 --> 00:12:31,263
Ooh!

307
00:12:31,298 --> 00:12:33,566
Abed...

308
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,884
- Oh!
- Oh!

309
00:12:34,918 --> 00:12:36,434
Troy!
What are we gonna do?

310
00:12:36,469 --> 00:12:37,970
Now you're open to input?

311
00:12:38,004 --> 00:12:39,254
I'm following him.

312
00:12:39,306 --> 00:12:43,057
You moving in here
was supposed to tone us down.

313
00:12:43,092 --> 00:12:46,044
So, Shirley, tell me--

314
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:48,046
how does someone
with your talent for foosball

315
00:12:48,063 --> 00:12:49,213
ever stop playing?

316
00:12:49,231 --> 00:12:50,716
Oh, I don't want to talk
about that.

317
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,052
Oh, come on, we're, like,
best friends now.

318
00:12:53,086 --> 00:12:55,287
Don't back away from this.
Open up to me.

319
00:12:55,322 --> 00:12:57,923
Okay, well...

320
00:12:57,957 --> 00:13:00,625
When I was a kid,
I had anger, Jeff--

321
00:13:00,659 --> 00:13:04,429
real bad anger--
and foosball was a release.

322
00:13:04,464 --> 00:13:06,164
But I didn't just--
just beat people.

323
00:13:06,198 --> 00:13:07,732
I-I broke 'em.

324
00:13:07,767 --> 00:13:09,418
One time I was running
this table

325
00:13:09,451 --> 00:13:11,035
over at this Y.M.C.A
across town,

326
00:13:11,071 --> 00:13:12,705
and I was really giving it
to this kid--

327
00:13:12,739 --> 00:13:14,740
this skinny little white boy,
no offense.

328
00:13:14,758 --> 00:13:17,576
He started crying.
They always started crying.

329
00:13:17,594 --> 00:13:19,077
But something about this boy

330
00:13:19,111 --> 00:13:20,261
made me want to take it
all the way.

331
00:13:20,297 --> 00:13:23,115
I started jabbing him
with the rods until...

332
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:25,967
The boy peed himself.

333
00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:27,753
Everybody laughed.
I laughed.

334
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:31,389
But after that,
the game lost its flavor.

335
00:13:31,423 --> 00:13:33,292
Once you make
a boy pee his pants,

336
00:13:33,326 --> 00:13:36,961
you start thinking
about where your life is headed.

337
00:13:36,996 --> 00:13:41,100
Jeff, what's wrong?

338
00:13:41,134 --> 00:13:42,951
Gonna kill you!

339
00:13:42,985 --> 00:13:44,620
Your ass is mine!

340
00:13:44,653 --> 00:13:46,322
You're such a punk!

341
00:13:46,373 --> 00:13:48,657
You like being beat by a girl?

342
00:13:48,707 --> 00:13:50,960
Yes!

343
00:13:50,994 --> 00:13:52,443
What are you crying for?

344
00:13:52,461 --> 00:13:53,962
Your mama cannot help you,

345
00:13:53,996 --> 00:13:55,880
and I know your daddy
ain't around,

346
00:13:55,914 --> 00:13:57,466
or you wouldn't play
like a bitch.

347
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,668
Ha!

348
00:13:59,719 --> 00:14:02,921
Ooh.

349
00:14:05,892 --> 00:14:08,677
Oh, my goodness gracious.
Is that what I think?

350
00:14:08,727 --> 00:14:11,296
I just beat this kid
all the way to tinkle-town.

351
00:14:11,313 --> 00:14:16,100
Tinkle-town, tinkle-town,
tinkle-town, tinkle-town.

352
00:14:16,135 --> 00:14:19,437
Tinkle-town,
tinkle-town, tinkle-town,

353
00:14:19,471 --> 00:14:21,907
tinkle-town, tinkle-town.

354
00:14:21,941 --> 00:14:23,609
You were Big Cheddar?

355
00:14:23,643 --> 00:14:25,744
Who told you that--

356
00:14:25,778 --> 00:14:29,081
Oh, dear lord.

357
00:14:29,115 --> 00:14:30,481
You're tinkle-town?

358
00:14:30,517 --> 00:14:32,750
Don't call me that.

359
00:14:32,786 --> 00:14:35,653
All your fake sweetness
and religion

360
00:14:35,688 --> 00:14:38,539
is just a veil covering
a horrible monster.

361
00:14:41,461 --> 00:14:44,379
And I had a lot
of Mountain Dew that day!

362
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,234
There's an 80 percent chance

363
00:14:52,354 --> 00:14:55,245
you can't leave Woodstock
until you bone these hippies.

364
00:14:55,365 --> 00:14:56,604
Oh, boy.

365
00:14:59,461 --> 00:15:00,494
Aah!

366
00:15:15,793 --> 00:15:17,860
You know what I came for, scum.

367
00:15:17,895 --> 00:15:18,861
Where is it?

368
00:15:18,897 --> 00:15:21,048
In the closet.
In the closet, man.

369
00:15:21,081 --> 00:15:22,982
- Abed, stop it!
- Get him!

370
00:15:23,018 --> 00:15:24,083
I mean, stop it.

371
00:15:24,119 --> 00:15:25,552
They're in the closet.

372
00:15:25,586 --> 00:15:28,422
I knew I'd get caught.
Just don't hurt me, Batman.

373
00:15:28,456 --> 00:15:30,758
Closet.

374
00:15:35,163 --> 00:15:36,629
Women's shoes?

375
00:15:36,664 --> 00:15:38,966
But Rick doesn't have a wife...

376
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,118
Or women's feet.

377
00:15:41,152 --> 00:15:43,403
Wait.
My summertime ballet flats?

378
00:15:43,437 --> 00:15:44,772
I thought I lost these
in the move.

379
00:15:44,806 --> 00:15:46,940
Is it there?
Does he have the DVD?

380
00:15:46,957 --> 00:15:48,875
- The what?
- The DVD.

381
00:15:48,909 --> 00:15:51,678
He has it, all right.

382
00:15:51,712 --> 00:15:53,913
And it looks like he broke it.

383
00:15:53,947 --> 00:15:56,450
Ah.

384
00:15:56,484 --> 00:15:58,152
Who are you?

385
00:16:02,524 --> 00:16:04,591
If you had something to say,

386
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,393
why not put it
in the text message?

387
00:16:06,427 --> 00:16:08,595
I wasn't sure what to say.

388
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:10,931
Do you understand

389
00:16:10,965 --> 00:16:12,982
what you did to me...
Big Cheddar?

390
00:16:13,018 --> 00:16:14,434
Please don't call me that.

391
00:16:14,469 --> 00:16:16,669
Why not?
It's what you are--

392
00:16:16,705 --> 00:16:18,404
a mean, nasty bully.

393
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,341
I was 12 years old.

394
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:21,607
I peed!

395
00:16:21,643 --> 00:16:23,443
I had to change schools.

396
00:16:23,477 --> 00:16:25,111
I changed everything--

397
00:16:25,145 --> 00:16:27,447
my clothes, my hair,
my personality--

398
00:16:27,481 --> 00:16:28,682
because of you.

399
00:16:28,716 --> 00:16:30,750
What a waste.

400
00:16:30,784 --> 00:16:32,619
I wish I could take a picture
of you right now

401
00:16:32,653 --> 00:16:34,254
and send it
to my ten-year-old self.

402
00:16:34,288 --> 00:16:35,706
Watch it, Winger.

403
00:16:35,756 --> 00:16:37,890
You don't have a trademark
on self-pity.

404
00:16:37,926 --> 00:16:40,043
- I will defend myself.
- Good.

405
00:16:40,077 --> 00:16:41,495
Bring the cheddar...

406
00:16:41,528 --> 00:16:43,379
Big Cheddar.

407
00:16:43,414 --> 00:16:44,898
I'm gonna put you
on the express train

408
00:16:44,932 --> 00:16:46,667
back to tinkle-town!

409
00:16:59,096 --> 00:17:00,346
- Argh!
- Uh!

410
00:17:00,381 --> 00:17:01,849
Uh!
Aah!

411
00:17:01,883 --> 00:17:03,149
- Uh!
- Aah!

412
00:17:03,183 --> 00:17:07,820
Aah!

413
00:17:09,257 --> 00:17:12,326
Aah!

414
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,579
Ah!

415
00:17:16,614 --> 00:17:19,282
- Die!
- Never!

416
00:17:29,477 --> 00:17:31,545
Argh!

417
00:17:31,578 --> 00:17:34,381
Argh!

418
00:17:34,414 --> 00:17:35,632
Ah!

419
00:17:35,682 --> 00:17:37,083
- You get it.
- No, you get it.

420
00:17:37,102 --> 00:17:38,585
You're the one
that needs the advantage.

421
00:17:38,619 --> 00:17:41,054
Wrong. Wrong!

422
00:17:41,087 --> 00:17:43,523
Every game I ever won,
I won fairly.

423
00:17:43,557 --> 00:17:45,792
Foosball was how I measured
my value as a man.

424
00:17:45,826 --> 00:17:46,960
You took that away!

425
00:17:46,994 --> 00:17:48,228
Why do think I had to?

426
00:17:48,261 --> 00:17:49,480
You try sprouting three feet

427
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:50,763
just when boys
are about to look at you.

428
00:17:50,781 --> 00:17:52,598
Everyone stopped liking me.

429
00:17:52,634 --> 00:17:54,067
This game is all I had.

430
00:17:54,101 --> 00:17:56,102
- It's all I had.
- Well, that's stupid.

431
00:17:56,121 --> 00:17:57,938
You're a perfectly fine person.

432
00:17:57,971 --> 00:18:00,073
So are you.

433
00:18:00,106 --> 00:18:02,241
Thank you.

434
00:18:02,277 --> 00:18:04,461
You're welcome.

435
00:18:07,949 --> 00:18:10,616
I'm sorry, Jeff.

436
00:18:13,153 --> 00:18:16,522
You don't have anything
to be sorry for, Shirley.

437
00:18:16,557 --> 00:18:18,759
So Rick has agreed to stay
out of your apartment

438
00:18:18,792 --> 00:18:20,326
as long as you stay out of his.

439
00:18:20,361 --> 00:18:22,128
And I'm getting tired
of saying this to people,

440
00:18:22,163 --> 00:18:23,329
but these things
wouldn't happen

441
00:18:23,364 --> 00:18:24,964
if you'd invest
in a simple shoe safe.

442
00:18:24,999 --> 00:18:26,500
That's it?

443
00:18:26,534 --> 00:18:29,469
Now we just live upstairs
from this...

444
00:18:29,487 --> 00:18:31,637
Guy that's really
into footwear?

445
00:18:31,673 --> 00:18:32,972
Sweetie, you're a renter.

446
00:18:33,007 --> 00:18:34,641
Look forward to owning a house.

447
00:18:34,675 --> 00:18:36,108
Be glad he's not into heads.

448
00:18:36,144 --> 00:18:37,478
Thanks for your help, officer,

449
00:18:37,511 --> 00:18:38,878
and if you should ever need me,

450
00:18:38,913 --> 00:18:41,414
I usually get out
of school around 4:00.

451
00:18:41,449 --> 00:18:44,017
This guys sleeps outside your
room, though, and that's okay?

452
00:18:44,051 --> 00:18:45,919
Uh...

453
00:18:45,953 --> 00:18:48,422
There's one thing
I don't understand.

454
00:18:48,455 --> 00:18:50,757
Why would Rick deny
taking my DVD?

455
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,125
And why break it?

456
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,863
Well, maybe he stepped on it
by accident

457
00:18:55,896 --> 00:18:59,365
and felt really,
really, really bad.

458
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,901
All the more reason to confess.

459
00:19:00,934 --> 00:19:02,336
Well, not everybody's
perfect, Abed.

460
00:19:02,369 --> 00:19:04,304
Batman. And I am.

461
00:19:04,338 --> 00:19:06,272
Well, Batman,

462
00:19:06,307 --> 00:19:09,108
on behalf of all of us
that aren't perfect,

463
00:19:09,143 --> 00:19:12,211
can I just say
I'm sorry I broke your DVD?

464
00:19:12,247 --> 00:19:14,615
Apology accepted.

465
00:19:14,648 --> 00:19:16,115
But I wouldn't mention it
to Abed.

466
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,617
That guy's pretty ruthless.

467
00:19:17,652 --> 00:19:19,987
And that's coming from Batman.

468
00:19:24,409 --> 00:19:26,358
Hey, guys.

469
00:19:26,376 --> 00:19:28,795
Abed, where have you been?

470
00:19:28,829 --> 00:19:30,063
Troy, really?

471
00:19:30,097 --> 00:19:31,064
Let it go.

472
00:19:31,098 --> 00:19:34,200
Aw, black in the house!

473
00:19:34,219 --> 00:19:36,752
- My hand is cramping.
- It's fine.

474
00:19:36,804 --> 00:19:40,641
Oh.
Hey, freudenkatzen.

475
00:19:40,674 --> 00:19:42,209
Ready for your schpankin'?

476
00:19:42,242 --> 00:19:44,644
Just like we practiced?

477
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:47,396
Let's shut 'em down.

478
00:19:47,432 --> 00:19:50,067
Ha ha ha.
Let's dance, David Bowie.

479
00:20:05,767 --> 00:20:07,300
Get the ball, Karl.

480
00:20:07,335 --> 00:20:09,252
I'm trying,
and stop yelling at me.

481
00:20:09,287 --> 00:20:11,454
Stop being such a schvine!

482
00:20:11,506 --> 00:20:12,673
Aren't you guys
playing foosball?

483
00:20:12,707 --> 00:20:14,473
We've played enough
for one lifetime.

00:20:14,509 --> 00:20:16,175
We're gonna go see a movie.

485
00:20:20,441 --> 00:20:22,932
Since when are those two
so close?

Hello. This is November 29th

488
00:20:36,662 --> 00:20:38,086
and I'm Leonard,

489
00:20:38,396 --> 00:20:40,030
and today I'm reviewing.

490
00:20:40,066 --> 00:20:43,451
<i>Eugenio's four cheese</i>
<i>frozen pizza.</i>

491
00:20:43,486 --> 00:20:45,936
That's $5.99 at Kroger's.

492
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:49,973
I've tried it before,
and we'll see.

493
00:20:54,145 --> 00:20:56,163
Mmm!

494
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:59,784
Mmm, the cheese is good.

495
00:20:59,818 --> 00:21:01,469
The sauce is good too.

496
00:21:01,503 --> 00:21:04,888
Mm, well,
it's definitely a buy.

497
00:21:04,923 --> 00:21:07,459
<i>Eugenio's four cheese</i>
<i>frozen pizza--</i>

498
00:21:07,492 --> 00:21:10,295
a buy.

499
00:21:10,328 --> 00:21:11,462
See you next time.
