Jeff. Jeff?

20
00:00:59,735 --> 00:01:01,490
Oh, sorry.
Uh, what was the question?

21
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:03,094
What are we gonna do
without Pierce

22
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,362
in the study group this year?

23
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,665
I'm sure we'll figure it out.

24
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,599
Speaking of figuring
things out,

25
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,936
me and Abed
have an announcement.

26
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,674
Troy and I are living together.

27
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:16,942
- Oh, that's--
- Oh, that's nice.

28
00:01:16,977 --> 00:01:18,144
If you want to get us a gift,

29
00:01:18,177 --> 00:01:19,512
we're registered
at linens 'n things.

30
00:01:19,545 --> 00:01:20,980
We have plenty of linens.
We mainly want the things.

31
00:01:21,013 --> 00:01:23,081
How you like me now, bitches?

32
00:01:23,115 --> 00:01:24,516
Dean, you seem different.

33
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:25,885
Are you in a play right now?

34
00:01:25,918 --> 00:01:27,052
Over the summer,
I decided it's time

35
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,888
to whip this place into shape.

36
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:31,956
I'm gonna be a mean, lean,
deaning machine.

37
00:01:31,974 --> 00:01:34,126
No more paintball,
no more spaceships,

38
00:01:34,144 --> 00:01:36,162
no more trampolines,
and no more--

39
00:01:36,195 --> 00:01:38,229
What is that?

40
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,832
It's probably the monkey
that lives in the vents.

41
00:01:40,866 --> 00:01:43,569
I named him "Annie's boobs,"
after Annie's boobs.

42
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,971
See, this is the kind of
national lampoonery

43
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:48,189
that is coming
to an end this year.

44
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,341
Homie don't dean this.

45
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:51,644
Okay, guys,
let's get to biology on time.

46
00:01:51,677 --> 00:01:53,811
I don't want to be
a screwup this year.

47
00:01:53,829 --> 00:01:55,480
Uh, Britta.

48
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:57,483
Damn it.

49
00:01:57,516 --> 00:01:59,218
We're really doing this
without Pierce?

50
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:00,753
So sad.

51
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:02,888
Yeah, we have parted ways
with our closest,

52
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:05,456
oldest, craziest,
most racist, oldest,

53
00:02:05,474 --> 00:02:08,394
elderly, crazy friend,
and he's not coming back.

54
00:02:08,427 --> 00:02:09,461
I'm back.

55
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:12,798
How was your summer?

56
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:14,933
Enlightful, Annie.

57
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:18,137
I underwent three months
of intensive soul-rezoning

58
00:02:18,155 --> 00:02:20,489
at the laser lotus
celebrity center.

59
00:02:20,524 --> 00:02:24,576
I stand before you a more
highly evolved Pierce Hawthorne,

60
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:29,080
one that can accept
that this table has a--

61
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:30,248
has a sort of magic in it.

62
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:31,484
Aww.

63
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,151
And I'd like to come back.

64
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,888
- Yeah.
- Damn it!

65
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:37,924
Oh, uh, sorry.

66
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:39,625
I just had
the frustrating realization

67
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,659
that you can't come back
to the group,

68
00:02:41,677 --> 00:02:43,495
because you're not in biology
and it's all filled up.

69
00:02:43,513 --> 00:02:44,829
Well, couldn't we take
something else?

70
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:47,015
I mean, surely we've
evolved beyond

71
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,516
caring what class
we take together.

72
00:02:48,551 --> 00:02:50,235
- Oh, yeah.
- Pierce!

73
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,723
I'll do you one better.

74
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:58,043
I think we've evolved beyond
reliance on a group at all.

75
00:02:58,078 --> 00:03:00,780
Aren't we just actual friends
now, no matter where we are?

76
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:02,514
You know what's magic
about this table?

77
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:06,085
It magically keeps our books
from falling on the floor.

78
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:10,122
The table's for studying,
but as friends, we've evolved.

79
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:11,907
And let's use that first breath

80
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:14,492
of crisp, new,
super evolved air

81
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:18,563
to declare proudly
and in one voice, "Pierce...

82
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:23,134
We'll see you
when we see you."

00:04:15,152 --> 00:04:17,471
to your special hat
and sideburns.

93
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:18,504
Am I missing anything?

94
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,663
Yeah! The human being
underneath it all,

95
00:04:20,783 --> 00:04:22,995
but no one's really interested
in that, are they?

96
00:04:23,028 --> 00:04:23,750
No.

97
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,677
I hope we did the right thing
about Pierce.

98
00:04:25,797 --> 00:04:27,132
He really seems
like he's changed.

99
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:28,266
What are you, nuts?

100
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,468
That's what
he wants you to think.

101
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:31,536
Trust me, we're better off
without him.

102
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:33,672
Excluding Pierce is what
drove him crazy last year.

103
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:36,007
Wrong, being crazy
drove him excluded.

104
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:39,478
What's wrong?

105
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:40,978
Cougar town has been moved
to mid-season.

106
00:04:40,997 --> 00:04:42,848
That's never a good sign.

107
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:44,550
Not cool, not cool, not cool,
not cool, not cool--

108
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:46,718
Hey buddy, hey,
it's coming back in January.

109
00:04:46,752 --> 00:04:47,786
Six seasons and a movie.

110
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:50,172
Six seasons and a movie.

111
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:52,091
Oh.

112
00:04:54,293 --> 00:04:56,295
This is Intro to Biology.

113
00:04:56,329 --> 00:05:00,932
I'm your professor,
Dr. Marshall King, PhD.

114
00:05:00,966 --> 00:05:04,720
It took me 6,205 hours
to get my degree,

115
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:08,439
and I know, because I was only
allowed in the library

116
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:11,944
one hour per day at the San
Vicente correctional facility

117
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:17,031
while serving a sentence
of 25 to life.

118
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:19,067
Now let's talk about that word.

119
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:20,619
"Life."

120
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,737
Sorry.

121
00:05:22,788 --> 00:05:26,408
It's a new phone.
Switching to vibrate.

122
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:29,528
Continue.
This is really great.

123
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:33,098
I stared at a crack in the
ground in my cell for years,

124
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:35,367
and one day,
something grew from it.

125
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:37,802
A single blade of grass.

126
00:05:41,473 --> 00:05:43,942
Vibrates louder than the ringer.

127
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:48,047
Gosh. You know what?
Turning it off.

128
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:52,651
Living thing,
growing from dead stone.

129
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:54,937
Get out!

130
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:56,572
- Oh, it's off, it's off.
- Out!

131
00:05:56,605 --> 00:05:58,456
I turned it off.

132
00:06:00,007 --> 00:06:01,944
Fine. Okay, fine.
I'm leaving.

133
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:03,428
And don't bother coming back.

134
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:05,074
Seriously?
Hey, dude,

135
00:06:05,194 --> 00:06:08,334
Sean Penn called.
He says to dial it back.

136
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:09,567
Sean Penn is an actor who--

137
00:06:09,586 --> 00:06:12,012
I know who Sean Penn is.
I've seen Milk.

138
00:06:12,132 --> 00:06:14,305
Now get out.

139
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:16,307
Dude, learn to blend.

140
00:06:17,988 --> 00:06:21,146
I will not tolerate
monkeys living on campus.

141
00:06:21,182 --> 00:06:23,216
If I wanted
to run a monkey hotel,

142
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,518
I'd install a banana buffet.

143
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,387
I'd use vines as elevators,

144
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,322
and I'd put tail holes
in the bathrobes,

145
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:30,939
and I'd lower all the shower
knobs.

146
00:06:30,992 --> 00:06:32,574
Wow, you've really thought
this through.

147
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:34,427
And now it's your turn.
Brainstorm.

148
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:35,495
Idea shower.

149
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,230
Spray your solutions
all over me.

150
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:39,331
Well, w-we could seal
all the vents

151
00:06:39,367 --> 00:06:41,367
and then pump the ducts
with some kind of gas

152
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,637
that knocks out monkeys.

153
00:06:44,672 --> 00:06:46,423
Monkey knockout gas!

154
00:06:46,456 --> 00:06:49,141
Now that's the kind of grounded,
sensible thinking

155
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:51,427
I want to see this year.

156
00:06:51,461 --> 00:06:52,646
Catherine, who's next?

157
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,879
Vice Dean Laybourne,

158
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,915
from the air conditioning
repair school annex.

159
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,716
Vice Dean.

160
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,151
Dean.
New suit, Dean?

161
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:01,954
New Dean, vice Dean.
New Dean.

162
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:04,124
I see that you
used school funds

163
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:07,259
to buy an espresso machine
for your faculty break room.

164
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:09,762
I don't recall
being consulted on that.

165
00:07:09,797 --> 00:07:11,314
I don't consult you
on anything.

166
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:12,932
That's the problem.

167
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:16,336
The air-conditioning repair
school annex seems to think.

168
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,103
That it's separate
from Greendale,

169
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:21,440
but it's an annex.

170
00:07:21,459 --> 00:07:23,776
An appendage, on a body,
with a head,

171
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,047
and this head is saying
to this appendage,

172
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:29,415
"whazup?"

173
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,783
What you say makes sense, Dean.

174
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,384
Tell you what.

175
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:37,223
You bring your head down
to my appendage tomorrow,

176
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:38,992
and I'll show you
"whazup."

177
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:42,362
I'll be there.

178
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:58,327
I think I found something
that will help Abed!

179
00:07:58,362 --> 00:08:00,480
Abed, did you know
that Cougar Town

180
00:08:00,514 --> 00:08:05,151
is an American adaptation
of a 1990s British sitcom?

181
00:08:05,168 --> 00:08:07,052
Cougarton abbey.

182
00:08:07,088 --> 00:08:09,488
Just been 'round
Cougarton chapel.

183
00:08:09,523 --> 00:08:11,490
I may be having an awakening.

184
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:12,925
Come off it, Deidre.

185
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,728
You've only been having
a butchers at the choir boys.

186
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,182
Better than nothing.
Thanks, Britta.

187
00:08:19,216 --> 00:08:20,266
Can you believe that guy,

188
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,802
kicking me out of class
like that?

189
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,053
It's gonna be impossible
to find a science class

190
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:26,189
with six open spots.

191
00:08:26,223 --> 00:08:27,540
Why would we need to do that?

192
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:28,690
Because I'm not in biology
anymore.

193
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:30,410
And neither is Pierce,

194
00:08:30,444 --> 00:08:31,978
but you're both
still our friends.

195
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,245
We've evolved.

196
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,380
Right, Jeff?

197
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,288
Yes, we have.

198
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:45,073
- And we all love each other.
- Mm-hmm.

199
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:48,995
And we all go
to the same school, so, uh...

200
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,297
I guess I'll see ya
when I see ya.

201
00:08:54,335 --> 00:08:55,384
Hey, guess what.

202
00:08:55,418 --> 00:08:57,470
I was on the wait list
for biology,

203
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:59,438
somebody got kicked out,
I am--

204
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:00,706
Here to study!

205
00:09:00,724 --> 00:09:02,436
Yay!

206
00:09:10,451 --> 00:09:12,452
All hail, sir eats alone.

207
00:09:12,471 --> 00:09:13,522
Shut up, Leonard.

208
00:09:13,556 --> 00:09:15,256
I heard about
your prescription socks.

209
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,976
Hope you don't mind, Jeff,

210
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:19,977
but I've got
a new favorite show,

211
00:09:20,011 --> 00:09:21,229
and I'm only on episode six.

212
00:09:21,264 --> 00:09:23,398
You guys got about
five minutes left to eat.

213
00:09:23,432 --> 00:09:25,817
Oh, my, time flies when you're
studying the science of life.

214
00:09:25,851 --> 00:09:27,351
Well, I think time flies
when you're joking around

215
00:09:27,385 --> 00:09:29,636
about movie titles that sound
like names for poops.

216
00:09:29,654 --> 00:09:31,706
Remains of the day.

217
00:09:32,841 --> 00:09:33,991
Wait a second.

218
00:09:34,025 --> 00:09:36,311
Were you eavesdropping
on our study session?

219
00:09:36,328 --> 00:09:38,645
I was eavesdropping
on your goof-off session,

220
00:09:38,663 --> 00:09:40,414
and you dummies missed
the most obvious one.

221
00:09:40,448 --> 00:09:41,950
No, I said,
"Green Mile."

222
00:09:41,984 --> 00:09:43,484
Operation dumbo drop!

223
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:45,820
- Ew!
- Gross!

224
00:09:45,837 --> 00:09:47,254
Too clever by half, Jeffrey.

225
00:09:47,289 --> 00:09:49,290
All right, well uh, I gotta go.

226
00:09:49,325 --> 00:09:50,325
Thanks for the five minutes.

227
00:09:50,342 --> 00:09:51,659
Aw, Jeffrey.

228
00:09:51,693 --> 00:09:54,863
Blimey. The barrister's
foreclosed the abbey.

229
00:09:54,897 --> 00:09:57,932
Fancy a drink, then?

230
00:09:57,966 --> 00:10:01,269
Oi, fetch us a hemlock.

231
00:10:01,303 --> 00:10:04,105
Um...

232
00:10:11,947 --> 00:10:13,981
- Um--
- Britta?

233
00:10:14,015 --> 00:10:16,518
Why did everyone
on Cougarton Abbey just die?

234
00:10:16,552 --> 00:10:18,452
They only ran six episodes.

235
00:10:18,486 --> 00:10:20,688
That's the great thing about
British tv.

236
00:10:20,722 --> 00:10:21,855
They give you closure.

237
00:10:22,991 --> 00:10:24,075
No, no, no!

238
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,210
We'll find you
a new favorite show!

239
00:10:25,244 --> 00:10:26,461
We'll find you
a new favorite show!

240
00:10:26,495 --> 00:10:30,164
Come on, buddy.

241
00:10:30,198 --> 00:10:31,533
You are human tennis elbow.

242
00:10:31,567 --> 00:10:34,418
You are a pizza burn on the roof
of the world's mouth.

243
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:37,438
You are the opposite of Batman.

244
00:10:42,979 --> 00:10:44,278
You don't need them, man.

245
00:10:44,312 --> 00:10:46,815
Exactly.
I'll see 'em when I see 'em.

246
00:10:46,849 --> 00:10:48,250
Totally.

247
00:10:48,283 --> 00:10:49,517
You and I, we should
hang out some time, huh?

248
00:10:49,552 --> 00:10:50,951
Grab a drink?

249
00:10:50,986 --> 00:10:52,620
Sure.
Where are you living now?

250
00:10:52,654 --> 00:10:54,154
The air vents.

251
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:57,225
I live in the air vents
of the school. Shhhh!

252
00:10:57,259 --> 00:11:04,099
I'm free, Jeff. Free!

253
00:11:04,133 --> 00:11:08,068
I gotta get back in that class.

254
00:11:08,086 --> 00:11:12,572
Real Dean coming through--
Oh, my goodness spacious,

255
00:11:12,591 --> 00:11:14,375
vice dean...

256
00:11:14,409 --> 00:11:16,344
Is this where Greendale's money
is going?

257
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:18,346
More accurately, Dean,

258
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,148
it's where Greendale's money
comes from.

259
00:11:20,182 --> 00:11:23,418
Our air-conditioning program
has a job placement rate

260
00:11:23,451 --> 00:11:26,553
five times higher than the rest
of your school combined.

261
00:11:26,588 --> 00:11:29,758
Our alumnini donations
comprise 80%

262
00:11:29,792 --> 00:11:31,125
of your entire school's budget.

263
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:34,361
And you want to know why
we think we deserve

264
00:11:34,397 --> 00:11:36,163
an espresso machine?!

265
00:11:36,197 --> 00:11:39,067
Well, I guess
I didn't know. I--

266
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,635
And you never had to, Dean.
You could have lived

267
00:11:41,653 --> 00:11:43,772
the rest of your life
in blissful ignorance

268
00:11:43,806 --> 00:11:46,908
and died a happy,
pansexual imp.

269
00:11:46,942 --> 00:11:50,245
But you wanted
to feel power this year.

270
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:53,782
Well, now, you're going
to feel my power

271
00:11:53,816 --> 00:11:57,652
as it surges downward from me,
straight through you,

272
00:11:57,687 --> 00:12:02,323
from nostril to rectum,
now until the end of time.

273
00:12:02,357 --> 00:12:05,293
And that's "whazup."

274
00:12:06,461 --> 00:12:09,163
I forgot everything you said
before "rectum"!

275
00:12:11,933 --> 00:12:13,183
Who are these guys?

276
00:12:13,219 --> 00:12:16,171
This is my legal team
because I think it's time

277
00:12:16,205 --> 00:12:17,572
we worked out a new agreement.

278
00:12:17,605 --> 00:12:19,374
He doesn't look like a lawyer.

279
00:12:19,408 --> 00:12:20,708
That's a barber.

280
00:12:20,743 --> 00:12:23,812
Because I'm also sick
of that ridiculous goatee.

281
00:12:23,846 --> 00:12:26,548
You look like
a white Lou Gossett, Jr.

282
00:12:31,287 --> 00:12:33,855
You deserve a bigger office.

283
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:35,423
Biggest office I ever had.

284
00:12:35,457 --> 00:12:37,826
I'm here to apologize,
Dr. King,

285
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,727
and beg you for a seat
in biology.

286
00:12:39,761 --> 00:12:41,495
I tell you what, 'N Sync,
you wanna learn about life?

287
00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:42,697
Give up the phone.

288
00:12:42,731 --> 00:12:44,599
Oh. You're asking me
for a bribe?

289
00:12:44,633 --> 00:12:47,235
I can't be bought, man.
You feel me?

290
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:49,937
See, prison was my walls.

291
00:12:49,971 --> 00:12:52,273
But you put your walls up.

292
00:12:52,307 --> 00:12:54,676
You, and your phone,
and your attitude,

293
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,110
and your fruit loops cologne.

294
00:12:56,144 --> 00:12:57,912
Your walls put up so tight, man,

295
00:12:57,947 --> 00:13:00,849
not even a blade of grass
could get through.

296
00:13:00,883 --> 00:13:03,684
But even if it did,
you wouldn't appreciate it.

297
00:13:03,719 --> 00:13:06,386
That's why you can't
come back to my class.

298
00:13:06,404 --> 00:13:08,690
What's your problem
with me, man?

299
00:13:08,724 --> 00:13:11,692
And don't act like it's not
about me specifically

300
00:13:11,726 --> 00:13:14,928
because you've been in--

301
00:13:14,964 --> 00:13:19,116
Busted!

302
00:13:23,172 --> 00:13:25,756
Hey!
Take it easy, Winger.

303
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:26,975
Everything okay?

304
00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:28,759
It is now that I have this.

305
00:13:28,793 --> 00:13:31,745
This is my ticket
to getting back in the group.

306
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,248
Hey! Hey!

307
00:13:35,467 --> 00:13:39,187
I want to be
in the group so bad!

308
00:13:42,224 --> 00:13:47,695
All right, let's smoke 'em
and choke 'em.

309
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:51,032
No! No! N-n-n--

310
00:13:51,066 --> 00:13:53,434
Uh-oh!
What is that?

311
00:13:53,469 --> 00:13:56,870
Monkey gas!

312
00:13:56,905 --> 00:13:58,440
Monkey gas?

313
00:14:00,158 --> 00:14:05,613
Oh, my g--

314
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,648
Abed?

315
00:14:40,665 --> 00:14:42,317
All your friends are here.

316
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,317
They wanna talk to you.

317
00:14:43,351 --> 00:14:44,586
I don't get it.

318
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,986
How is this different
from the way he always is?

319
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,154
I don't want to push it,

320
00:14:47,188 --> 00:14:48,523
but this would be a great time
to baptize him.

321
00:14:48,557 --> 00:14:51,658
Abed, maybe this can be
your new favorite show.

322
00:14:51,693 --> 00:14:53,661
It's a British Sci-Fi series

323
00:14:53,696 --> 00:14:56,029
that's been on the air
since 1962.

324
00:14:56,065 --> 00:14:57,999
Britta, you've done enough,
okay?

325
00:14:58,033 --> 00:14:59,433
Why don't you go start
a ruiners' club?

326
00:14:59,467 --> 00:15:01,001
Oh wait, you'd probably
just ruin it.

327
00:15:01,035 --> 00:15:02,736
Well then,
I'd be doing a good job

328
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,004
because it's a ruiners' club.

329
00:15:04,038 --> 00:15:05,740
You ruined my analogy.

330
00:15:05,774 --> 00:15:07,357
Guys, look!

331
00:15:15,951 --> 00:15:17,684
Blimey, inspector!

332
00:15:17,702 --> 00:15:19,037
Where have we wound up
this time?

333
00:15:19,071 --> 00:15:23,591
The question isn't where,
constable, but when.

334
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,460
Inspector, look out!
Blorgons!

335
00:15:25,494 --> 00:15:28,529
Eradicate! Eradicate!

336
00:15:28,563 --> 00:15:30,899
This is the best show I've
ever seen in my entire life.

337
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,836
Having fun without me again?

338
00:15:35,971 --> 00:15:39,807
Jeff, what happened?
You look 70.

339
00:15:39,841 --> 00:15:41,975
Abed has
a new favorite tv show, Jeff.

340
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:43,927
It's called
Inspector Spacetime--

341
00:15:43,979 --> 00:15:46,748
Can it, boobs.
I came here to let you know

342
00:15:46,782 --> 00:15:49,683
that your best friend Pierce
is the one that got me

343
00:15:49,717 --> 00:15:52,820
kicked out of bio class
and the study group.

344
00:15:52,855 --> 00:15:55,856
It was a plan he hatched
from the beginning

345
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:58,775
with his pal, Professor Kane.

346
00:15:58,826 --> 00:16:03,331
But, Jeff, that's a photo
I gave our professor

347
00:16:03,365 --> 00:16:07,567
of me visiting Hawthorne Wipes'
spokesman and rap artist

348
00:16:07,586 --> 00:16:09,671
Sugar Cube in prison
during the '90s.

349
00:16:09,705 --> 00:16:12,956
Well, th-th-they look alike.

350
00:16:13,008 --> 00:16:16,443
Uh, I guess they share one
important feature in your eyes.

351
00:16:16,477 --> 00:16:18,078
Well, that's not fair!

352
00:16:18,096 --> 00:16:20,682
Look, I-I-I-I
was standing far away,

353
00:16:20,716 --> 00:16:21,966
and I saw the prison uniform!

354
00:16:22,017 --> 00:16:24,251
Oh, Jeffrey!

355
00:16:24,286 --> 00:16:25,419
Oh, come on, obviously
I don't mean

356
00:16:25,453 --> 00:16:26,419
all black people are in prison!

357
00:16:26,437 --> 00:16:28,940
Oh!

358
00:16:28,974 --> 00:16:31,609
Jeff, clearly you have gone
off the deep end.

359
00:16:31,644 --> 00:16:32,927
Don't blame him.

360
00:16:32,961 --> 00:16:35,312
The table is powerful,
and being cut off from it--

361
00:16:35,364 --> 00:16:38,198
Shut the--

362
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:45,773
I've become...
Agitated.

363
00:16:45,807 --> 00:16:48,241
I apologize.

364
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:51,312
We'll continue this discourse
at a later date.

365
00:16:51,346 --> 00:16:52,547
Good night.

366
00:16:52,581 --> 00:16:55,182
He just needs some space.

367
00:16:58,636 --> 00:17:00,321
I'm going to kill
the one thing you love!

368
00:17:00,355 --> 00:17:01,972
I'm gonna kill it!

369
00:17:02,006 --> 00:17:07,178
As long as it breathes,
it controls our lives!

370
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,299
I just came by to tell everyone

371
00:17:12,334 --> 00:17:15,202
this year isn't gonna be
that different.

372
00:17:15,237 --> 00:17:20,173
With the notable exception,
we really won't have any money.

373
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:22,109
Have a nice night.

374
00:17:26,647 --> 00:17:28,664
What is with that guy?

375
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:32,675
Did you find the monkey?

376
00:17:32,915 --> 00:17:34,849
No, but here's the invoice
for the gassing.

377
00:17:34,884 --> 00:17:38,153
Okay, as it turns out,
I cannot pay this...

378
00:17:38,188 --> 00:17:41,507
Or your salaries starting on...
Two weeks ago.

379
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:45,176
But, what I do have are
these vouchers

380
00:17:45,211 --> 00:17:47,863
for the classes
of your choosing.

381
00:17:56,038 --> 00:17:58,606
You're lucky I need
my scuba certification.

382
00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:09,484
Okay, okay.

383
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:11,586
I'm the one
living in your vents.

384
00:18:11,621 --> 00:18:13,221
I have no home and no job.

385
00:18:13,256 --> 00:18:17,358
Does that mean you'll work
for room and board?

386
00:18:22,164 --> 00:18:25,768
Okay, I was lying
the whole time.

387
00:18:25,801 --> 00:18:27,803
I didn't want the group
to evolve.

388
00:18:27,837 --> 00:18:30,573
I just didn't want Pierce
around. I hate him.

389
00:18:30,606 --> 00:18:36,144
Okay, but Jeff, what you did--
it's hard to get past that.

390
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:37,596
I know you're already out
of the study group,

391
00:18:37,646 --> 00:18:40,816
but I'm gonna have to ask that
you stop being my friend.

392
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:47,439
Okay, look, everybody,
here's the thing,

393
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:50,492
I am not as evolved
as I said I was.

394
00:18:50,527 --> 00:18:53,828
The biology class was full,
so I told Professor Kane

395
00:18:53,864 --> 00:18:55,748
I'd pay him
a few thousand dollars to...

396
00:18:55,781 --> 00:18:56,781
K-kick Jeff out.

397
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,334
What?!
Pierce!

398
00:18:58,367 --> 00:19:00,568
What?

399
00:19:00,586 --> 00:19:03,005
I can't believe Jeff attacked
a table with a fire axe

400
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:05,340
and still only managed to be the
second craziest man in the room.

401
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:08,277
Okay, everybody in favor of
voting Pierce out of the group?

402
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,546
Stop! Stop!

403
00:19:10,579 --> 00:19:12,681
Pierce isn't crazy.

404
00:19:12,715 --> 00:19:15,984
The table...

405
00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:19,355
Is...Magic.

406
00:19:19,388 --> 00:19:21,022
As someone who's been
on the other side,

407
00:19:21,057 --> 00:19:23,424
I can tell you,

408
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,994
it is a scary, lonely,
Chang-filled world out there,

409
00:19:26,028 --> 00:19:28,463
and sure, this group has
sprouted some legs,

410
00:19:28,498 --> 00:19:31,967
but why are we in such a rush
to leave the tide pool,

411
00:19:32,001 --> 00:19:34,537
when the only things
waiting for us on shore

412
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:36,838
are the sands of time.

413
00:19:36,873 --> 00:19:39,842
And the hungry seagulls
of slowly growing apart.

414
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:42,344
Man, I really need this
biology class.

415
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,502
Pierce!

416
00:19:51,555 --> 00:19:53,655
Professor Kane has never taken
a bribe from anyone in his life.

417
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:54,957
You feel me?

418
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:59,260
Yeah, I lied, but you seem
to have a harder time

419
00:19:59,296 --> 00:20:00,645
being the bad guy than me.

420
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:06,402
You're right. I do...

421
00:20:06,435 --> 00:20:08,470
Which, in a weird way,
makes me a pretty bad guy.

422
00:20:08,505 --> 00:20:09,971
We're one and the same.

423
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:12,074
Please don't.

424
00:20:12,107 --> 00:20:14,643
Jeff, but you're still
kicked out of biology.

425
00:20:14,661 --> 00:20:16,945
Oh, I'm not worried about it.

426
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:20,315
Life has a way
of breaking through.

427
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,150
So, uh, here's what
I'm thinking.

428
00:20:22,167 --> 00:20:25,336
I'm a drug dealer, right?
And you're a scientist,

429
00:20:25,372 --> 00:20:27,923
so couldn't we get, like,

430
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:30,659
a Breaking Bad
type of thing going?

431
00:20:30,693 --> 00:20:34,496
Sorry, star-face, you just
lost your seat in my class.

432
00:20:39,817 --> 00:20:41,602
There, now the table
is good as new.

433
00:20:41,653 --> 00:20:42,987
And so is Abed.

434
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,322
Britta, I'm sorry I was
overprotective about it.

435
00:20:45,356 --> 00:20:46,538
I'll try and be more supportive
of you.

436
00:20:46,659 --> 00:20:48,259
Well, here's your first chance.

437
00:20:48,292 --> 00:20:51,112
Helping Abed has inspired me
to finally declare a major.

438
00:20:51,163 --> 00:20:53,631
I'm gonna study Psychology.

439
00:20:53,664 --> 00:20:55,532
Like in a research capacity?

440
00:20:55,567 --> 00:21:00,003
No, in a hands-on capacity.
I'm gonna be a therapist.

441
00:21:00,038 --> 00:21:03,039
Oh.

442
00:21:03,075 --> 00:21:05,843
Hey, hey, hey, keep it down.

443
00:21:05,876 --> 00:21:07,443
There's a new sheriff in town.

444
00:21:10,115 --> 00:21:16,528
- Oh, interesting. So this is
the year we all die. - Yes, it is.

445
00:21:16,647 --> 00:21:22,592
