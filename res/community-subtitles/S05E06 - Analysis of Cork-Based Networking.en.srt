1
00:00:01,197 --> 00:00:04,578
Save Greendale Committee,
please welcome our newest member...

2
00:00:04,742 --> 00:00:06,663
...math teacher Ben Chang.

3
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:12,844
Okay, let's get serious.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,927
I've compiled a short list of the most
immediate Greendale emergencies.

5
00:00:17,087 --> 00:00:19,223
Is deforestation on the list?

6
00:00:19,381 --> 00:00:21,849
I, for one, am glad
that this is happening.

7
00:00:22,009 --> 00:00:24,559
What this school needs
is a band of heroes.

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,154
Champions willing to rise up and
"Get all those potatoes out of the gym."

9
00:00:30,309 --> 00:00:33,406
Like House Vogadash in the HBO
series, Bloodlines of Conquest.

10
00:00:33,562 --> 00:00:35,116
- Oh, yeah.
- My show right there.

11
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:36,989
That is a good show.

12
00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:40,198
They really get the incest right.

13
00:00:41,362 --> 00:00:43,248
What the hell is
Bloodlines of Conquest?

14
00:00:43,405 --> 00:00:45,874
Mediaeval fantasy
based on these books nobody read.

15
00:00:46,033 --> 00:00:48,750
It's great. It's got betrayal, boobs,
espionage, dragons.

16
00:00:48,911 --> 00:00:52,339
Oh, wait, dragons? Is that a spoiler?
I just started season one.

17
00:00:52,498 --> 00:00:54,005
I don't start watching shows...

18
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:57,180
...until they're so popular,
watching is no longer a statement.

19
00:00:57,336 --> 00:01:00,800
You're behind, so we have to live
in a world where there's no dragons?

20
00:01:00,965 --> 00:01:03,682
Do we have to pretend
that Lord Stevarios is still alive?

21
00:01:03,843 --> 00:01:07,271
Thanks, Abed. How about I buy
all the Bloodlines of Conquest books...

22
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:09,980
...read ahead, and spoil
the whole series for you?

23
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,522
- An insane person would do that.
- Knuckleheads, focus.

24
00:01:13,686 --> 00:01:16,984
Item one, the Greendale student census
is out of date.

25
00:01:17,147 --> 00:01:19,616
Britta, Abed,
why don't you partner up on that one?

26
00:01:19,775 --> 00:01:21,614
Give you a chance to squash this beef.

27
00:01:21,777 --> 00:01:25,490
Next, midterm dance is tonight. Who'd
like to be on the decorating committee?

28
00:01:25,656 --> 00:01:27,495
- No.
- Fine. I'll do it.

29
00:01:27,658 --> 00:01:30,790
- I will be on that committee.
- Me too.

30
00:01:31,245 --> 00:01:34,093
Are you guys volunteering
because I'll do all the work?

31
00:01:34,248 --> 00:01:35,422
- I wouldn't.
- Not at all.

32
00:01:35,583 --> 00:01:37,385
I don't care enough to lie, so no.

33
00:01:37,543 --> 00:01:41,304
I will reward that honesty
by giving you something easy.

34
00:01:41,463 --> 00:01:44,560
A bulletin board fell down in
the cafeteria a couple months ago.

35
00:01:44,717 --> 00:01:47,647
- Think you can get it hung back up?
- I'll give it a drive-by.

36
00:01:47,803 --> 00:01:50,484
Great. We have now completed
our first task:

37
00:01:50,639 --> 00:01:52,276
Have a productive meeting.

38
00:01:52,433 --> 00:01:54,402
For every task that we complete...

39
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,490
...a star goes on the task wall.

40
00:01:59,523 --> 00:02:00,697
Oh, no.

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

42
00:02:29,178 --> 00:02:30,649
Yeah.

43
00:02:30,804 --> 00:02:32,975
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

44
00:02:35,309 --> 00:02:38,239
Brince Ironstone's daughter
is his mother!

45
00:02:40,272 --> 00:02:44,329
Brince Ironstone's daughter
is his mother!

46
00:02:46,821 --> 00:02:48,541
Hi, there.

47
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,429
- What can I do for you?
- Get me a drill, screws, bulletin board?

48
00:03:08,592 --> 00:03:10,763
- No, I cannot.
- Okay, I tried. Bye.

49
00:03:10,928 --> 00:03:13,478
If you wanna hang a bulletin board,
get a work order.

50
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:15,146
They're more powerful than you?

51
00:03:15,683 --> 00:03:19,064
I'm taking census. Fill out this form,
but don't talk. I can't hear.

52
00:03:19,228 --> 00:03:20,651
I can't hear either.

53
00:03:20,813 --> 00:03:23,743
Are you deaf? But you read lips?

54
00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:27,910
Gibberish. You're good.

55
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:29,614
Thank you.

56
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,417
I wish I knew sign language.

57
00:03:31,574 --> 00:03:33,211
I detonated a mollusc.

58
00:03:34,952 --> 00:03:37,835
Are you gonna have another
intense burst of compatibility...

59
00:03:37,997 --> 00:03:40,583
- ...with a girl we never see again?
- I can't hear you.

60
00:03:40,749 --> 00:03:41,793
Banana. Train.

61
00:03:43,794 --> 00:03:47,176
The midterm dance
will need a visual theme...

62
00:03:47,339 --> 00:03:50,554
...like "Let's Blow Off Steam,"
and it's trains.

63
00:03:50,718 --> 00:03:53,054
- I have an idea.
- Your last idea was to murder.

64
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,225
Edison, the bulletin board's a no-go.

65
00:03:55,389 --> 00:04:02,116
Really? So you did your best
and this task just eludes you?

66
00:04:02,271 --> 00:04:05,735
I have a lifetime of experience with
red tape. I know when to walk away.

67
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,154
- Yeah, you do.
- Hey, Edison.

68
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,831
The system is lazy. I have integrity,
too much to deal with any of it.

69
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:15,168
- I'll do it myself.
- And I would love to watch you try.

70
00:04:15,326 --> 00:04:17,580
Okay. I am on bulletin board duty.

71
00:04:18,245 --> 00:04:21,093
You guys are in charge of the dance.

72
00:04:25,794 --> 00:04:28,013
Oh, Professor Pushpin.

73
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,848
Jerry, Carlo, Crazy Schmidt. I'm Annie.

74
00:04:31,008 --> 00:04:32,515
- You learned our names.
- I did.

75
00:04:32,676 --> 00:04:35,180
Crazy Schmidt,
how are C.J.'s clarinet lessons going?

76
00:04:37,014 --> 00:04:38,853
Well, she's having a little trouble...

77
00:04:39,016 --> 00:04:41,650
...with her left finger lifts,
but she's getting there.

78
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:44,112
Annie, do you want
that bulletin board hung up?

79
00:04:44,271 --> 00:04:46,775
Let me put in a work order for you.

80
00:04:49,652 --> 00:04:53,744
There you go. That should happen
in three to six business months.

81
00:04:54,865 --> 00:04:57,451
Any way we could
bump that up a little...

82
00:04:57,618 --> 00:05:00,715
...so it's somewhere above
"Lower flag for Reagan's death"?

83
00:05:00,871 --> 00:05:03,885
- Talk to a custodian. We're janitors.
- There's a difference?

84
00:05:04,542 --> 00:05:06,760
We were just starting to like you.

85
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:09,174
- Had enough?
- I'm just getting started.

86
00:05:09,338 --> 00:05:11,343
What was your stumbling block,
being nice?

87
00:05:11,507 --> 00:05:14,556
Look, I admire your idealism,
but my guess is...

88
00:05:14,718 --> 00:05:18,811
...that you will be crying uncle
before that board ever goes up.

89
00:05:18,973 --> 00:05:20,812
Game on, baby.

90
00:05:26,897 --> 00:05:28,487
Come on. Come on.

91
00:05:32,653 --> 00:05:34,409
What? God.

92
00:05:35,948 --> 00:05:37,075
Nice try.

93
00:05:37,241 --> 00:05:39,163
This isn't over.

94
00:05:39,451 --> 00:05:41,338
Sandals! Sandals!

95
00:05:45,356 --> 00:05:49,413
Here we go. You wanted to get dirty.
This is where it starts.

96
00:05:52,739 --> 00:05:54,376
Deputy Custodian Lapari...

97
00:05:54,532 --> 00:05:57,960
...Annie Edison from Save Greendale
Committee. How's your daughter's...?

98
00:05:58,119 --> 00:06:01,465
Sorry, this is a closed function.
We don't discuss business at mixers.

99
00:06:01,622 --> 00:06:04,552
- But your daughter, soccer...
- Soccer. Yes. Thanks for coming.

100
00:06:05,752 --> 00:06:07,424
Get a load of that wood burnt sign.

101
00:06:08,796 --> 00:06:11,514
Did Mr. Whitney in Woodshop
make that for you guys?

102
00:06:11,674 --> 00:06:13,560
Yes, that is a Whitney original.

103
00:06:13,718 --> 00:06:17,514
You know, I noticed that Whitney's
bathroom has this amazing toilet.

104
00:06:17,805 --> 00:06:20,190
Flushes like a DC-10 turbine.

105
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,855
Probably exceeds code.

106
00:06:23,352 --> 00:06:26,532
But what's wrong with a little
friendship between departments?

107
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:29,443
Now, how can our committee
be your friend?

108
00:06:32,528 --> 00:06:35,032
- Bob?
- Excuse me.

109
00:06:35,198 --> 00:06:38,460
Chief Custodian Bob Waite,
Buzz Hickey, Annie Edison.

110
00:06:38,618 --> 00:06:42,046
Hickey and Edison,
something in the job queue.

111
00:06:42,205 --> 00:06:44,969
- Bulletin board.
- Yeah. We were hoping to get that up...

112
00:06:45,917 --> 00:06:47,589
- Let's take a walk.
- Quite a spread.

113
00:06:47,752 --> 00:06:49,555
- I'm impressed.
- It's election time.

114
00:06:49,712 --> 00:06:53,141
If I don't break out sausages, my ass
goes in the grinder next January.

115
00:06:53,299 --> 00:06:55,684
Keeping my people happy.
It's an uphill battle.

116
00:06:55,843 --> 00:06:57,599
For example, look at this.

117
00:06:58,971 --> 00:07:00,977
A lot of the websites we try and visit...

118
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:05,649
...get blocked by this weird filter thing.
Say I wanted to move a work order...

119
00:07:05,812 --> 00:07:08,908
...for a bulletin board from
the bottom of the queue to the top.

120
00:07:09,065 --> 00:07:10,536
Now, how can I do that...

121
00:07:10,691 --> 00:07:14,239
...when I'm dealing with this?

122
00:07:15,321 --> 00:07:16,828
They want their porn unblocked.

123
00:07:16,989 --> 00:07:19,707
- Then they'll give you your board.
- That's what that was?

124
00:07:19,867 --> 00:07:23,213
How did you know? Did you investigate
pornography when you were a cop?

125
00:07:23,371 --> 00:07:24,498
Something like that.

126
00:07:24,664 --> 00:07:26,835
- He wants a bribe.
- Welcome to the labyrinth.

127
00:07:26,999 --> 00:07:30,677
Only there ain't no puppets
or bisexual rock stars down here.

128
00:07:30,837 --> 00:07:33,387
So at the centre of it all,
if you're lucky...

129
00:07:33,548 --> 00:07:37,012
...a piece of cork and a few pins.
So, what, is it worth it?

130
00:07:37,176 --> 00:07:40,724
Is that all a bulletin board is?
A piece of cork? That's not what it is...

131
00:07:40,888 --> 00:07:43,937
...to people that lose their pets,
people that need rides...

132
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,197
...people whose bad bands
need bad bass players.

133
00:07:47,353 --> 00:07:50,616
To them, every pushpin
has the power to change the future.

134
00:07:50,773 --> 00:07:53,454
So, yes, professor, it's worth it.

135
00:07:54,652 --> 00:07:56,704
I know a lady in the IT Department.

136
00:08:01,701 --> 00:08:05,047
I learned how to say this
in sign language.

137
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,384
You're a fast learner.

138
00:08:08,332 --> 00:08:10,669
I learned how to say this
in sign language.

139
00:08:12,545 --> 00:08:13,968
Don't forget I can read lips.

140
00:08:15,047 --> 00:08:17,516
I learned how to say this
in sign language.

141
00:08:19,218 --> 00:08:23,525
Okay, I'll put some food on the tables,
dim the lights, that's a midterm dance.

142
00:08:25,058 --> 00:08:28,735
I guess it could use
a little something theme-wise.

143
00:08:28,895 --> 00:08:30,864
I have an idea.

144
00:08:34,901 --> 00:08:37,369
"Bear Down For Midterms."

145
00:08:38,738 --> 00:08:42,332
- What?
- "Bear Down For Midterms."

146
00:08:42,492 --> 00:08:45,671
You can't just repeat it.
You need to explain yourself.

147
00:08:46,454 --> 00:08:50,595
It's midterm time.
People have to "bear down"...

148
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,553
...study hard, get to work.

149
00:08:53,044 --> 00:08:55,927
It's "Bear Down For Midterms."

150
00:08:56,089 --> 00:08:57,928
Is there a dot I'm not connecting?

151
00:08:58,091 --> 00:09:00,559
It's a play on words.
"Bear down" is an expression.

152
00:09:00,718 --> 00:09:02,688
I know the expression, Chang.

153
00:09:02,845 --> 00:09:05,693
"Fly on the wall" is an expression,
but if I were to pitch:

154
00:09:05,848 --> 00:09:10,357
"Fly On The Wall For Midterms,"
you might ask, "What do you mean?"

155
00:09:13,272 --> 00:09:14,613
Chang?

156
00:09:15,441 --> 00:09:16,568
Are you crying?

157
00:09:16,984 --> 00:09:20,199
I understand I've been crazy
in the past...

158
00:09:20,363 --> 00:09:23,709
...but it doesn't make it less frustrating
to be dismissed like this.

159
00:09:23,866 --> 00:09:26,203
I don't know if you guys
see me as human anymore.

160
00:09:26,369 --> 00:09:30,082
I don't know if it's like a joke to you.
Are all Asian men like a joke?

161
00:09:30,248 --> 00:09:31,291
- A racial thing?
- No.

162
00:09:31,457 --> 00:09:34,305
- No. No.
- I paid for my crimes.

163
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:38,850
Underneath all the craziness,
I am still a human, and I...

164
00:09:39,006 --> 00:09:41,475
I do wanna make a difference.

165
00:09:41,634 --> 00:09:45,775
And can you respect that? Please?

166
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:50,603
Chang, what can we do here?

167
00:09:51,144 --> 00:09:52,816
"Bear Down For Midterms."

168
00:09:52,979 --> 00:09:54,450
- Okay.
- Okay, well...

169
00:09:54,605 --> 00:09:56,242
We'll put up some bear things?

170
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,112
We'll bear down. For midterms.

171
00:10:00,278 --> 00:10:01,321
Okay.

172
00:10:01,487 --> 00:10:04,666
You want me to lift web restrictions
solely for Custodial?

173
00:10:04,824 --> 00:10:09,000
They need to have full access
so they can research custodian stuff.

174
00:10:09,162 --> 00:10:11,546
If the filter is mistakenly
blocking a site...

175
00:10:11,706 --> 00:10:14,007
...they just need to submit the URL
and I can...

176
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:16,338
- Okay. What do you want?
- Excuse me?

177
00:10:16,502 --> 00:10:19,136
Tell us what we can do,
so that you can do this for us.

178
00:10:19,297 --> 00:10:22,346
Oh, cool.
I didn't know it could work that way.

179
00:10:22,508 --> 00:10:24,311
I guess I could use decent parking.

180
00:10:24,469 --> 00:10:29,819
Right now they make me park
in Annex B like a lunch lady.

181
00:10:29,974 --> 00:10:31,860
Our committee can talk to Parking.

182
00:10:32,018 --> 00:10:35,031
Let's be clear. I want everything
to get through that blocker.

183
00:10:35,188 --> 00:10:39,031
- What do you mean everything?
- Everything!

184
00:10:39,734 --> 00:10:41,371
Understood.

185
00:10:43,821 --> 00:10:46,158
I'm very happy right now.

186
00:10:46,324 --> 00:10:48,127
- So just, bears everywhere?
- Yep.

187
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,960
And then we'll have some cakes,
party hats.

188
00:10:52,121 --> 00:10:55,550
Birthday stuff. This is coming together
better than I thought.

189
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:57,844
I'm sorry, birthday stuff?

190
00:10:58,002 --> 00:10:59,723
- Yes, Duncan.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

191
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:01,718
Birthday stuff.

192
00:11:01,881 --> 00:11:05,843
Well, I've been sad to see that bulletin
board down in the cafeteria for so long.

193
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:07,766
Always had a passion for bulletins.

194
00:11:07,929 --> 00:11:11,986
If parking for the IT guy puts
that board back where it belongs...

195
00:11:12,141 --> 00:11:13,814
...I won't stand in the way.

196
00:11:13,976 --> 00:11:16,028
You need,
speaking as a fan of bulletins...

197
00:11:16,187 --> 00:11:18,773
...to have the dean appoint
someone to oversee them...

198
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:22,154
...to make sure they
stay organised and protected. I'll do it.

199
00:11:22,318 --> 00:11:25,912
- We could look into that.
- Well, not to be that guy...

200
00:11:28,783 --> 00:11:31,203
...but could you look into that
before I do this?

201
00:11:31,369 --> 00:11:34,086
You wanna control all bulletin boards
in the school. Why?

202
00:11:34,247 --> 00:11:36,548
You might wanna start talking turkey,
Waldron...

203
00:11:36,707 --> 00:11:39,804
...the Macy's Parade is almost over
and Grandma's getting drunk.

204
00:11:39,961 --> 00:11:42,048
Know where my department's power
comes from?

205
00:11:42,213 --> 00:11:43,969
- Parking spaces.
- Wrong.

206
00:11:44,132 --> 00:11:46,717
There was plenty of space to park
in dinosaur times...

207
00:11:46,884 --> 00:11:49,435
...but not one single
Parking Department.

208
00:11:49,595 --> 00:11:51,766
My power comes
from a scarcity of parking...

209
00:11:51,931 --> 00:11:54,517
...just like your dad's comes
from a lack of hugs.

210
00:11:54,684 --> 00:11:57,448
And you know what takes
my power away? Carpools.

211
00:11:57,603 --> 00:12:00,403
Carpools organised
through rideshares.

212
00:12:00,565 --> 00:12:03,697
Rideshares posted on bulletin boards,
you son of...

213
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,328
Take the books off your head,
we're done posturing.

214
00:12:06,487 --> 00:12:08,955
You want me to talk turkey,
well, gobble, gobble...

215
00:12:09,115 --> 00:12:10,669
...I want rideshares gone.

216
00:12:10,825 --> 00:12:13,162
- Let's get out of here.
- All right.

217
00:12:13,327 --> 00:12:14,964
- What?
- I'll talk to the dean.

218
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,759
So you don't even know
what Ewoks sound like?

219
00:12:22,503 --> 00:12:27,308
The subtitles describe it as
"yip-chaa."

220
00:12:27,508 --> 00:12:29,478
That's actually pretty close.

221
00:12:29,635 --> 00:12:32,684
I must say, I don't know what we did,
but we sure did it.

222
00:12:32,847 --> 00:12:35,564
I guess the key to dance decoration
is just pick an idea.

223
00:12:35,725 --> 00:12:38,228
And bear down. Right, buddy?

224
00:12:38,394 --> 00:12:41,491
Here are your sodas. Oh, my God.

225
00:12:41,647 --> 00:12:43,735
- Yeah. Pretty great.
- Yeah. Bear down, baby.

226
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,620
Too soon, you guys.

227
00:12:45,777 --> 00:12:47,117
This is way too soon.

228
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:49,117
- Too soon for what?
- Too soon for this.

229
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,870
After this morning in Wisconsin?

230
00:12:52,075 --> 00:12:54,874
Bear breaks loose at kid's party,
mauls a bunch of people.

231
00:12:55,036 --> 00:13:00,125
Why am I explaining this when this
is obviously a ghoulish reference to it?

232
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:02,462
The news has been
covering it all morning!

233
00:13:06,547 --> 00:13:08,434
That's where I got the idea.

234
00:13:08,591 --> 00:13:11,095
Sometimes you hear something,
forget you heard it...

235
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:14,475
...but you think you came up with...
Oh, man, this is bad.

236
00:13:15,223 --> 00:13:17,109
We're in crisis mode now.

237
00:13:17,266 --> 00:13:19,651
We really messed up, you guys.

238
00:13:20,728 --> 00:13:23,528
"An Office of Bulletin Board
Oversight."

239
00:13:23,689 --> 00:13:26,537
What a novel idea.
I'm gonna fill out this form right away.

240
00:13:26,859 --> 00:13:28,864
But first, a toast...

241
00:13:29,028 --> 00:13:30,618
...to hanging a bulletin board.

242
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:33,628
Easy-peasy, lemon squeezy.

243
00:13:35,118 --> 00:13:39,128
First time toasting? Get in here, buddy.
Easy-peasy, lemon squeezy.

244
00:13:39,288 --> 00:13:40,380
I'm not saying that.

245
00:13:41,374 --> 00:13:44,588
Oh, well, I hate to be that guy...

246
00:13:44,752 --> 00:13:48,596
...but I'm not signing this form
until Professor Hickey says:

247
00:13:48,756 --> 00:13:50,726
"Easy-peasy, lemon squeezy."

248
00:13:50,883 --> 00:13:53,220
Damn it, Annie. Don't do this.

249
00:13:53,386 --> 00:13:55,308
Whatever you've got in your butt...

250
00:13:55,471 --> 00:13:56,943
...can we get it out later?

251
00:13:57,098 --> 00:13:59,317
When, after he signs it?
After it's too late?

252
00:13:59,475 --> 00:14:02,061
- Annie?
- You petty old man.

253
00:14:02,228 --> 00:14:05,158
When we started, I thought
you'd get a taste of the system...

254
00:14:05,314 --> 00:14:07,900
...and spit it out,
not open a bottling plant.

255
00:14:08,067 --> 00:14:11,780
- You're just like all the people that...
- What? The people that put you here?

256
00:14:11,946 --> 00:14:15,374
The people in the big machine
that made you fail?

257
00:14:15,533 --> 00:14:18,214
You went from being a cop
to teaching criminology...

258
00:14:18,369 --> 00:14:19,923
...because of the system, right?

259
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,626
Unfortunately for Greendale, you have
to prove it by getting nothing done.

260
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,132
Here's a bulletin for you:

261
00:14:25,293 --> 00:14:29,516
Annie Edison
doesn't get nothing done.

262
00:14:29,672 --> 00:14:31,345
Where should I put that bulletin?

263
00:14:31,507 --> 00:14:34,687
On a sham piece of cork
controlled by a Parking guy...

264
00:14:34,844 --> 00:14:37,608
...that lights his cigars
on student rideshares?

265
00:14:38,806 --> 00:14:41,108
My God, Annie.

266
00:14:41,267 --> 00:14:43,153
What kind of labyrinth
have you created?

267
00:14:43,311 --> 00:14:46,408
Certainly not the magic kind
with puppets and macho rock stars.

268
00:14:46,564 --> 00:14:49,779
You whored yourself out, kid.
You wanted that board so bad...

269
00:14:49,942 --> 00:14:52,030
...you made every board
on campus worthless.

270
00:14:52,195 --> 00:14:55,493
And in doing so,
made the school just a shade dirtier.

271
00:14:57,533 --> 00:14:59,538
I thought better of you, young lady.

272
00:15:00,745 --> 00:15:03,213
Oh, man, this got Sorkin-y.

273
00:15:03,372 --> 00:15:06,220
Yeah, well, I didn't think anything
in particular of you...

274
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,712
...and now I see why!

275
00:15:09,796 --> 00:15:15,146
Okay, I didn't follow most of that,
but it feels like I ought to do this:

276
00:15:23,357 --> 00:15:25,160
Oh, hey, Annie.

277
00:15:26,611 --> 00:15:27,654
What do you think?

278
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,956
"Fat Dog For Midterms"?

279
00:15:30,114 --> 00:15:31,325
- Yeah.
- Pretty cool.

280
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,578
- I don't understand.
- That's an expression.

281
00:15:33,743 --> 00:15:36,840
"Fat Dog For Midterms."
Like, "Don't sweat it. Fat dog it.

282
00:15:36,996 --> 00:15:40,709
- Hang out, relax, like a fat dog."
- Look it up on Wikipedia.

283
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:42,761
- There's an entry in there.
- Yep.

284
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:46,098
I never... Okay, I just...

285
00:15:46,255 --> 00:15:48,592
- I feel like I'm missing...
- You know, Annie...

286
00:15:49,675 --> 00:15:53,686
...sometimes it feels like
you don't take us seriously.

287
00:15:53,846 --> 00:15:56,860
We bring it on ourselves,
but it's still pretty frustrating.

288
00:15:57,016 --> 00:15:59,353
- Annie, is this a race thing?
- Race.

289
00:15:59,518 --> 00:16:01,606
No! God, no.

290
00:16:01,771 --> 00:16:04,868
You guys.
I accept that it's an expression.

291
00:16:05,024 --> 00:16:06,578
But I don't see the connection...

292
00:16:06,734 --> 00:16:09,119
You're over-thinking, Annie.
It's decorating.

293
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:12,042
Just pick an idea and bear down on it.

294
00:16:12,198 --> 00:16:14,452
Really poor choice of words, Ben.
Too soon.

295
00:16:14,617 --> 00:16:16,836
You guys are right. I'm sorry.

296
00:16:16,994 --> 00:16:22,712
I've had a really hard day.
I need to just fat dog this concept.

297
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,631
- Fat dog.
- Fat dog it, baby.

298
00:16:24,794 --> 00:16:27,297
- Right.
- This will be perfect.

299
00:16:30,591 --> 00:16:32,727
This has been a great day.

300
00:16:33,135 --> 00:16:34,607
Yes.

301
00:16:36,264 --> 00:16:42,564
But sometimes,
great days can turn ugly.

302
00:16:42,728 --> 00:16:47,734
Like when Queen Stevarios massacres
the entire Vogadash family...

303
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,404
...at Lord Brince's funeral...

304
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:53,417
...in Bloodlines of Conquest.

305
00:16:55,283 --> 00:16:59,459
That's how the last book ends.

306
00:17:01,038 --> 00:17:02,082
Sugar.

307
00:17:02,248 --> 00:17:03,292
Thank you.

308
00:17:05,042 --> 00:17:07,925
I'm sorry, Abed,
but to the spoiler goes the victory.

309
00:17:08,087 --> 00:17:09,214
But I really liked her.

310
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,432
She likes you too,
but she also likes cash.

311
00:17:11,591 --> 00:17:13,311
I'm devastated.

312
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,064
Now I feel bad.

313
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,724
But you learned a lesson...

314
00:17:18,889 --> 00:17:21,523
...and I gave
a differently-abled person a job.

315
00:17:23,561 --> 00:17:26,408
Oh, no. Now I really feel bad.
Wait, no. Come back.

316
00:17:26,564 --> 00:17:29,245
Let's be fat dogs about this.

317
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,545
Hello. What happened to you?

318
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,120
- Nothing. You never called.
- I'm sorry.

319
00:17:40,661 --> 00:17:43,627
The year of the gas leak,
but I won't use that as an excuse.

320
00:17:43,789 --> 00:17:46,375
I can be inconsiderate
and a lot of other things.

321
00:17:47,001 --> 00:17:49,931
Me too.
I guess I could've put in some effort.

322
00:17:50,087 --> 00:17:55,438
- Do you want to go to lunch sometime?
- No. I'd like to go to dinner. Now.

323
00:17:55,843 --> 00:17:56,887
I can do that.

324
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:00,151
I started this coat check
without permission anyway.

325
00:19:11,794 --> 00:19:12,886
Excuse me. Excuse me.

326
00:19:13,045 --> 00:19:14,801
Excuse me. Excuse me.

327
00:19:14,964 --> 00:19:16,886
Excuse me.

328
00:19:27,894 --> 00:19:29,317
No!

329
00:19:33,399 --> 00:19:36,080
- No!
- All right, all right, enough!

330
00:19:41,407 --> 00:19:42,961
Let's go.

331
00:19:50,207 --> 00:19:52,378
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

332
00:19:54,587 --> 00:19:56,010
Let's do it again.

333
00:19:56,172 --> 00:19:58,722
There's a brand-new dance
Based on an old phrase

334
00:19:58,883 --> 00:20:00,853
It's called The Fat Dog
And it will amaze

335
00:20:01,135 --> 00:20:03,354
You've heard this expression
Your entire life

336
00:20:03,512 --> 00:20:05,565
It's not made up
It's not made up

337
00:20:05,723 --> 00:20:08,024
There's a brand-new dance
Based on an old phrase

338
00:20:08,184 --> 00:20:10,189
It's called The Fat Dog
And it will amaze

339
00:20:10,353 --> 00:20:11,824
You've heard this expression...

340
00:20:11,979 --> 00:20:15,076
It's a bear dance!

341
00:20:24,108 --> 00:20:25,828
Damn it.

342
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,870

Top.

354
00:21:07,818 --> 00:21:09,954

Wait. Who are you? Who is this?

357
00:21:15,117 --> 00:21:16,291
It's not... I'm...

358
00:21:25,461 --> 00:21:28,723
Right in front of you, stupid.

359
00:21:29,305 --> 00:21:35,469
