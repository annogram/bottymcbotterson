1
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:07,345
Well, see you after the break.
What you doing for Thanksgiving?

2
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:08,986
I'm having Andre's family over.

3
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:11,418
Though he'll be stuck
working for Black Friday.

4
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:15,856
Oh, sure, you get to say that,
but we're stuck calling it Jew Friday.

5
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:19,361
Ugh. I'll be with my family,
fielding the same old questions.

6
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,658
"How's community college?"
"What's your major?"

7
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:23,801
"Are those real?"
My aunt's boyfriend.

8
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:27,837
"Aw. My family's a normal religion.
I have to talk to them for five minutes

9
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:30,565
before I get a casserole
that's all marshmallow."

10
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,641
That's you.
SHIRLEY: Brainstorm.

11
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,403
Why don't you all come
to my house?

12
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:36,444
I'll have plenty of food.
Marshmallows!

13
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:38,583
Sounds good.
Was gonna microwave noodles.

14
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:40,149
This sounds promising. I'm in.

15
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:43,583
Goody. You're all welcome, of course.
I'm in.

16
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:46,087
Or, you know, Jeff or whoever.
Can't. Plans.

17
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:49,386
If you change your mind, can't think
of anyone who'd enjoy you more.

18
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,722
How-dean, pilgrims?

19
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,296
Is that--?
John Wayne. Yes.

20
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:54,488
Oh, good, you got it.

21
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:58,500
Anyhoo, I just thought
I'd mosey on over here,

22
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:03,767
invite you all to Greendale's
annual thanks-living potluck dinner,

23
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,968
where we remember
all we have to be thankful for.

24
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:09,409
There may be a link
to enrollment at Greendale

25
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,515
and holiday suicide.
Oh.

26
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:14,743
Just a shoelace and belt-free night
full of fun.

27
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,751
You should all drop by.

28
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,015
Or Jeff, or whoever.
He can't. He has plans.

29
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:21,591
Right, you are spending
Thanksgiving with your father.

30
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:25,027
I thought I told you
to stop reading my e-mail.

31
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:27,825
Yeah, well, I thought I told you
to stop keeping secrets.

32
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:30,900
How am to keep track
of what you tell me in confidence

33
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:34,470
and what I hear through your walls
with a glass to my ear?

34
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,768
Fine. Close your mouths.

35
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,970
I'm having Thanksgiving
with my estranged father. Move on.

36
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:44,206
Makes sense.
Jeff's at a point in his life

37
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,941
where he needs a strong
father figure to come out to.

38
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,018
Jeff, this is huge news.

39
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:53,021
Huger news. Was this decision made
after our Halloween conversation?

40
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:55,625
Yes, after, not because of.

41
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:56,817
BRITTA:
I'll take it.

42
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:00,624
You had that teed up?

43
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:04,332
When I say "thera", you say "pist"
Thera

44
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:05,868
TROY & ABED: Pist
BRITTA: Thera--

45
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:07,402
Aw.
Thanks for the support.

46
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,632
Oh, the support has just begun.

47
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:14,040
What do you want me to bring to Papa
Winger's house? Vegan pumpkin pie?

48
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,077
Britta, you're not coming.

49
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:17,476
Fine, regular pumpkin pie.

50
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:21,349
You're gonna need me
when things get messy and emotional.

51
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:23,454
The thing that will get emotional
is Troy

52
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,851
when he realizes there are yams
under those marshmallows.

53
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:27,923
I knew it was too good to be true.

54
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:33,030
Jeff, speaking not just as your friend
but as an avid daytime-TV watcher,

55
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:37,259
these parent-child reunions
can get intense.

56
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:40,370
Chairs might be thrown,
weaves might be pulled.

57
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:43,167
Or I could just go in there,
show him how awesome I am,

58
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,434
no thanks to him,
meet my half-brother

59
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:46,941
and then, boom, closure.

60
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:49,538
Your dad has another son?

61
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:52,012
Yeah. So clearly, he's moved on.
Why can't I?

62
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,584
Close your mouths.
Look, I appreciate your concern.

63
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:58,353
But the most helpful thing you can do
is stay out of my business.

64
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,354
Oh. Can you say that last part again?

65
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,356
These walls are entirely too thick.

66
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:06,287
Give me some rope
Tie me to a dream

67
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:09,194
Give me the hope
To run out of steam

68
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:12,831
Somebody said
It can be here

69
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:16,872
We could be roped up, tied up
Dead in a year

70
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:21,274
I can't count the reasons
I should stay

71
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:26,278
One by one
They all just fade away

72
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

73
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,669
Oh! Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.
ABED: Hey.

74
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:57,746
Let's carve that jive turkey.

75
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,444
Got that out of your system?
Yeah.

76
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,348
I'm happy to welcome you
to my home.

77
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:03,919
©hu iﬂhmk yam,

78
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:07,615
Come in. Take your coats off.
Make yourself comfortable.

79
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,284
Browse the available literature about
Jesus as your personal savior, or not.

80
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:12,589
No agenda.
Heh, heh, heh.

81
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,425
Are you gonna pass
some apps soon

82
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:17,363
or do I have to die of starvation
to prove a point?

83
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:19,298
This is Mr. Bennett, my father-in-law.

84
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,029
Dad, these are my friends
from college.

85
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:25,705
Oh, yeah. That's Andre's people.
They're a bunch of characters.

86
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,208
That's a good one, Dad.

87
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:28,505
Oh.
I brought something.

88
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:31,614
Dip.

89
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,342
Oh, Abed,
why is this seven-layer dip so puffy?

90
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:37,852
Been in the fridge for two years.
Saving it for a special occasion.

91
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:40,753
So thoughtful.
I'm gonna put this on a nice platter

92
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:43,018
with crackers in the trash.
Where's Britta?

93
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:45,128
BRITTA :
Hey, Jeff. What's up?

94
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,992
What's up is closure.

95
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:49,633
I met my dad,
we talked things out as men.

96
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,360
I think I'm ready to move on.
Really, in 20 minutes'?

97
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:54,571
Fine.

98
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:56,934
Look, I couldn't do it.

99
00:04:57,096 --> 00:05:00,168
I was at the front door, in control,
and then I started thinking

100
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:03,337
about all that stuff you said
about messiness.

101
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:05,042
Threw me off my game.

102
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:09,084
The irony is after all your pestering
that I deal with my daddy issues,

103
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:11,415
you're the reason
I'm not meeting my father.

104
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:14,285
Or maybe I'm the reason
you'll come here after all.

105
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:16,723
Britta, I-- Wait.

106
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,385
What do you mean by here?

107
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:22,363
Your dad's house,
where I kind of, sort of, am.

108
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:27,595
Yeah, thanks, Sharon.
I never thought about it that way.

109
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,570
Batman is sort of gay.
Be right back.

110
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:33,104
What is going on?

111
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:35,769
Why is Thanksgiving so terrible?
ANNIE: I know.

112
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:39,348
The tension, the backbiting,
the judgmental comments.

113
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:42,247
This makes Thanksgiving
with my family look--

114
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:45,582
Eh. Still pretty bad.
I said Batman was gay.

115
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:47,725
Huh. Sheesh.

116
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,383
You ask one lady
if she's Tyler Perry in drag

117
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:54,259
and suddenly, you're the bad guy.
It's a reference. That's my humor.

118
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,560
Abed gets it.
Oh, you're all hiding out in here.

119
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:00,534
Yeah. You know us, hide away.
"Hiding"?

120
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,230
Well, be careful.
You might be giving the impression

121
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:07,276
that you prefer the cold garage
to the warm hearth of my hospitality.

122
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:09,640
What? As if.

123
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:11,247
Yay.
Uh-huh.

124
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:13,543
Okay. Well, hurry back soon.
Okay.

125
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,548
This is the Jonestown of dinners.
Feel like I'm in jail.

126
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,883
You know what happens
to guys like me in jail.

127
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:23,721
They get really into push-ups. I am
fine with my upper body the way it is.

128
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:27,497
ABED:
It did feel like a prison,

129
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:30,327
and that meant only one thing
made sense conceptually.

130
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,798
We had to break out.

131
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:35,303
And someone with the gravitas
of Morgan Freeman had to narrate it.

132
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:36,804
We need to do a prison break.

133
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:45,410
Happy Thanksgiving?
You really "you'd" this one, huh?

134
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,642
Okay, yes,
I meddled against your wishes

135
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,650
and I got this address
from the dean.

136
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:53,382
But, hey, you had a moment of doubt,
and here I am to help you through it.

137
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:55,787
Psychology tells us
there are no accidents.

138
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:59,657
Oh, really? What about car accidents?
Tara Reid, or the Hindenburg?

139
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,321
Here goes nothing.

140
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:06,793
Hello, William.

141
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:16,102
So, uh, how about we make
a couple of ground rules?

142
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,807
Actually, that sounds good. No hugs.
Wouldn't want one.

143
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:21,610
No apologies.
Wouldn't accept one.

144
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:22,809
No calling you "dad."

145
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:24,784
No expectations.
No BS.

146
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,151
Drink? Eighteen?
Scotch. Neat.

147
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:30,783
I just want to acknowledge there are
a lot of emotions flowing right now.

148
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,692
You two are probably feeling
a strong impulse

149
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:35,264
to sleep with each other,

150
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:37,332
and hey, that's normal.

151
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:40,632
Wow. I'll get the drinks.

152
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:44,736
So how about that?
No muss, no fuss.

153
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:47,605
Jeff, I urge you not to run
from the muss and fuss.

154
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:48,802
MAN:
Hi.

155
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:53,650
Hi. You must be my half-brother.

156
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:57,152
Your hands are so much bigger
than mine.

157
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,983
Your nail beds are perfect.

158
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,988
I can't do it. I can't. Oh, God.

159
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,751
Ugh. Oh, it's coming up.

160
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:04,758
When I get upset, I vomit.

161
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,828
Oh, I see you've met Willy, Jr.

162
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,899
You said
he wasn't gonna replace me.

163
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:12,502
He's the Schwarzenegger.
I'm the DeVito.

164
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:13,728
I get it.

165
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,300
Okay, fellas, let's get right into it.

166
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:20,205
I think the big question
on everyone's mind...

167
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,876
is why don't I go help
Willy, Jr.? Hm?

168
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,746
ABED: One thing was clear
to me and the crew.

169
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,980
Bennett lockup
was not where we belonged.

170
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:34,556
We belonged in the sun,
with the wind in our hair.

171
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:36,990
Maybe at a Bennigan's,
enjoying a Turkey O'Toole.

172
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:38,651
We should tunnel out.

173
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:41,492
Abed, Shirley is our friend,
and we're guests in her home.

174
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:44,760
We need a plan that won't hurt
her feelings or damage her property.

175
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:47,302
Definitely don't look
behind that poster, then.

176
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,873
I could pretend to have a stroke.
Do a gibberish foreign language.

177
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,443
What if I did a gibberish
foreign language like Star Wars?

178
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,307
You'd like that, I bet. Dick.

179
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:59,143
Look, I'm sure we'll figure out
a way out of here.

180
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:02,445
What's important right now
is that we stick together.

181
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:04,554
Yeah.
Oh, there you are.

182
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,714
Who wants a pre-dinner snack?
Oh!

183
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,120
Oh, pumpkin, what's wrong?

184
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,723
It's too embarrassing to talk about
in front of the guys.

185
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,059
Know what I mean, girlfriend?
Oh, sweetie.

186
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,758
Do you have your monthly shame?

187
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:20,165
Do you wanna lie down
in Elijah's room?

188
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,203
Oh, I don't think that's gonna cut it.

189
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:25,137
I probably need to go home,
call Dr. Collins. It's that bad.

190
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:29,178
Oh, my sister-in-law's a gynecologist.
She's right in the other room.

191
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:32,043
There's no need to bother
your doctor on a holiday.

192
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:33,239
Go ahead. Mm-hm.

193
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,717
ABED: I'd like to tell you Annie avoided
Shirley's doctor sister-in-law,

194
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,787
but this ain't no fairy tale.

195
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:40,151
This is Thanksgiving.

196
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,160
WILLIAM:
Let's see, what else?

197
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:44,920
You've got some diabetes

198
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,121
on my mother's side.
JEFF: Good to know.

199
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:50,756
I like your hair.
The presence of it, I mean.

200
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,631
So I have a question.

201
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,670
It's been weighing on me
pretty heavily.

202
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:58,968
At your age, in the bedroom...

203
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:01,702
Oh, yeah. It's all good.

204
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:03,938
Yeah.
Real good.

205
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,309
Look at them.

206
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:06,541
Bonding.

207
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:09,312
Probably laughing
because I can't grow a beard.

208
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:10,613
I have an idea.

209
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:14,553
Why don't we use these dinner rolls
to do some role play?

210
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:17,622
I see what I did there.
Okay.

211
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:21,696
This roll, this is me.

212
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:23,800
He's crying.

213
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,163
Good. That's really good.

214
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:29,670
So, what do you do?
I'm a lawyer

215
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:32,275
who faked a bachelor's degree
and practiced law

216
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:35,241
for seven years before I got caught.
Ha, ha.

217
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:36,744
Like your hustle.

218
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:41,749
Reminds me of the summer I was
Ralph Lauren in Saint-Tropez, '83.

219
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:43,511
I'm on a boat with--

220
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:45,246
Damn it, Willy.

221
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:47,186
I'm expressing.
Knock it off.

222
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:50,327
Why can't you just swallow it
like any normal person?

223
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,019
WILLY:
Oh, heh, heh. Oh!

224
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:56,826
Right, like your new son. Like
mister-- Mr. I've-Got-My-Shirt--

225
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,832
I don't know personal details
about you.

226
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:02,768
Well, my name's Jeff.
Don't help me, Mr. Helper-Guy.

227
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:04,532
First Mom dies, now this?

228
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:08,167
Hey, she died 20 years ago, Willy.
He keeps singing the same old song.

229
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,538
Oh. She died on you.

230
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:14,082
Here I thought you'd become Father
of the Year, but you just got stuck.

231
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,710
Yeah, well, look, I don't have to tell
you, I'm not a natural caretaker,

232
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:20,619
but with Willy, you know,
I checked all the boxes

233
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,556
and he still turned out softer
than wet cheese.

234
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:25,218
I don't get it.

235
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:28,558
He keeps saying he's gonna
move out next week since '03.

236
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:30,758
Oh, man, I couldn't wait to get out.

237
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:33,597
I got my own place when I was 18.
I was the same way.

238
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:38,902
So who's ready to eat?

239
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:42,575
Jeff, you care to carve the turkey?
I knew it!

240
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:44,442
You love him more than me.

241
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:46,742
I'll show you. I'll run away.

242
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:49,819
Oh, please. Hey, be my guest.

243
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:53,081
You run away, and I'm gonna sleep
like a baby tonight.

244
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:57,791
Oh, now,
I'm sorry you guys had to see that,

245
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,827
but maybe you could shrink his head,

246
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:04,263
since you're here, for some reason.
Yes. I can do this.

247
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:07,566
Show me on the dinner roll
where you're hurt!

248
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:10,105
ABED: That's how it
went for the afternoon.

249
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:13,072
This tag- team turkey day
became our routine.

250
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,576
We endured the indignities
as best we could.

251
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,874
Cousins fighting,
complaints about the food,

252
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:20,347
listening to a nephew do Borat
for a full hour.

253
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:23,453
We figured out ways
to steal away from time to time,

254
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:25,816
saying we had to pee,
had to get ice,

255
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:27,753
had to do a Jewish thing
in the other room.

256
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:32,989
I became known as the guy
who could get you things.

257
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,395
Piece of gum,

258
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,290
Playing cards,

259
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:40,266
some novelty glasses
I found in a box marked "crap."

260
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,600
In those brief, tranquil moments,
we felt human. We felt free.

261
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:48,168
But sooner or la ter,
our warden would come knocking.

262
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:51,247
Mostly, we just waited for our time
to be served,

263
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:53,906
but some didn't take kindly
to waiting.

264
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:55,711
Some didn't have much time left.

265
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,752
Enough.
Amateur hour is over.

266
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,356
I'm going in there,
pretend to break a hip,

267
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:04,859
and we'll be sipping sambuca
at Skeeper's in no time.

268
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:12,996
Whoa. He tripped on the rug.
Wait, now he's getting up.

269
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:15,503
He's walking around dazed
like he's got a head injury.

270
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:18,642
Groin into the corner of the table.
This might actually work.

271
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,909
Wait, wait,
why are people laughing?

272
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,642
Let's see, I need a broom or a rake
or two rakes.

273
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:31,254
Pierce, you were supposed to pretend
to injure yourself so we could leave.

274
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,787
Leave?

275
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:35,357
This is my Showtime at the Apollo.

276
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:38,017
I'm killing out there.

277
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,761
ABED: Pierce was our last
hope, or so we thought.

278
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:45,762
It seemed Troy Barnes had a plan.

279
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:49,304
What if we got sick?
No. No more faking illnesses.

280
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:50,496
Not fake sick.

281
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,269
Real sick.

282
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:04,452
And that's when I told
my old firm to shove it.

283
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:09,622
I've always been more of a free agent.
Yeah, I can see that about you.

284
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:12,194
You seem like a self-made man.

285
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,627
Well, I kind of had to be.

286
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:17,927
Look, if it's okay with you,
I'd like to break a rule.

287
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:21,128
I know we said no mushy stuff,
but for what it's worth,

288
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,934
I'm proud of you.

289
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,435
Wow.

290
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:25,632
Thanks.

291
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:27,106
Makes you think, huh?

292
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,340
Wait, what do you mean?

293
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:32,573
Well, look, I mean,
you've seen how Willy turned out.

294
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:34,775
I mean,
I haven't done that kid any favors.

295
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:39,753
And so I look at you,
so self-reliant and well-adjusted,

296
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:42,222
and I think
maybe I did something right.

297
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,054
You did something right?

298
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,662
Well, let me say that different.

299
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:47,889
Uh...

300
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,795
Universe is a constantly expanding--
Stop.

301
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:52,663
I get the impulse. Not gonna work.

302
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:56,671
No, I just mean that we are defined
by what happens to us,

303
00:14:56,829 --> 00:15:00,800
and me leaving seems
to have made you independent,

304
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:02,172
made you strong.

305
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:06,146
With all due respect, which is none,

306
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:07,909
go to hell.

307
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,950
So tunneling out is off the table?

308
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:13,022
Who's hungry for turkey?

309
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:15,522
Shirley, we were just--
About to--

310
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:16,955
Eat garbage dip.

311
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:19,588
Why did I have to go third?

312
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,164
Look, I get it.
You wanna leave.

313
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:26,497
Shirley, we're sorry.
No, I'm sorry.

314
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:29,333
To be honest,
I invited you as a bit of a buffer.

315
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:31,805
With Andre's family,
I'm the butt of the joke.

316
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:35,673
With Andre gone this year, I thought
I could tip the scales in my favor

317
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:37,973
by having a few friends around.

318
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:40,276
That was wrong of me.

319
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,474
See you Monday.

320
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:47,148
I can't believe none of us noticed
she was having such a hard time.

321
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,389
We can't leave.
ABED: Funny thing about prison.

322
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:52,893
Sometimes the person you thought
was your warden

323
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:54,497
turns out to be a prisoner,

324
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:56,826
which doesn't line up
with the Shawshank thing.

325
00:15:56,989 --> 00:16:00,732
But maybe we've always been doing
more of a Prison Break, the show.

326
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:10,775
Gah! What are you doing in my car?

327
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:12,540
Take me with you.

328
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:13,979
Teach me what you know.

329
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,880
What in the cat's cradle
is happening?

330
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,076
Dad hates me.

331
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:19,586
What do you care what that guy thinks?
He's a dick.

332
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:21,725
See? That's what I need to learn.

333
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,554
How to be all dead inside
with muscles on top,

334
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,719
not all emotional and flabby.

335
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:29,559
Yeah, but you are emotional.
If you pretend you're not,

336
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:32,202
you're letting him off the hook
for being terrible,

337
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:33,860
which he is and always has been.

338
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:38,406
I mean, he meant the world to you,
and you meant nothing to him,

339
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:41,738
and if you run away now,
he'll never know.

340
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,144
He should know.

341
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:48,509
Britta's the worst.

342
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,047
Ow! Jeez!

343
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:54,253
Oh. I thought you guys left.

344
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:57,451
We started as your buffer,
but we're busting you out of here now.

345
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:59,960
I drew a map of your house
on my stomach.

346
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:03,566
Uh, I know what my house looks like.
That's what I said.

347
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:05,827
If we act fast, we can
get through this plan

348
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:08,562
to put you in the trash can,
take you out like trash.

349
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:10,764
But we gotta dress you
like a baby.

350
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:13,239
Thank you for doing this,
but I'm not going.

351
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:15,675
Those people up there,
they may be rude, pushy.

352
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:19,145
They may have come to wrongheaded
conclusions about Batman and Robin.

353
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:21,511
Oh. Thank you.
But they're my family.

354
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:24,449
Family means putting up
with each other even when it's hard.

355
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,556
You guys can go. I'll be fine.

356
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,450
Actually,

357
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:30,889
we're gonna stay.

358
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,553
SHIRLEY: Oh.
Yeah. Family sticks it out.

359
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,460
That's ni--

360
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,270
Okay, full disclosure.

361
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:43,270
We're hiding out
from that crazy white guy.

362
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:45,965
You came back.

363
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:49,112
I'm sorry. You should take some
credit for who I've become.

364
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:50,303
Okay.

365
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:53,245
So let me tell you how I turned out

366
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:56,443
just so you're crystal clear
on your impact.

367
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,891
I am not well-adjusted.

368
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:03,925
More often than not,
I am barely keeping it together.

369
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,963
I'm constantly texting,
and there's no one at the other end.

370
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,158
I'm just a grown man
who can't even look his own friends

371
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:13,530
in the eye for too long
because I'm afraid

372
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:15,797
that they'll see that I am broken.

373
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:17,936
So you get credit for that.

374
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,770
Oh, come on, now--
One time,

375
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,742
when I was in seventh grade,
I told everybody at school

376
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:24,437
that I had appendicitis.

377
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,640
I wanted someone
to worry about me.

378
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:29,581
But when Beth Brannon
asked to see the scar,

379
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:31,618
I didn't wanna get found out,

380
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:35,156
so I took Mom's scissors,
and I made one.

381
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:38,289
It hurt like hell, but it was worth it,

382
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,659
because I got 17 cards.

383
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,666
And I still keep them in a box
underneath my bed 22 years later

384
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:50,569
because it proves that someone,
at some point, cared about me.

385
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:52,800
You wanna see the scar?

386
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:57,003
So you get credit for that too.

387
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:58,807
This is me.

388
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,975
Look, Jeff, I, uh...

389
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:07,148
Daddy!
Are you faking a heart attack?

390
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,753
Kind of a Hail Mary.

391
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:13,356
Happy Thanksgiving, Dad.

392
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:23,235
Look, you're probably feeling
a very strong urge

393
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:26,001
to sleep with me right now,
and that is normal.

394
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,838
Yeah.

395
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,836
Britta,

396
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,675
thank you.

397
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:33,947
You were right.

398
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,715
You're not gonna get
all Jock Jams on me, are you?

399
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,616
No, of course not.

400
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:40,757
I left my boom box at school.

401
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:43,487
Jeez.

402
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:45,754
You gotta stop doing that.
Thank you.

403
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:48,895
Come here, brother.
Come here, brother.

404
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:51,432
JEFF: Wow. Why don't you save
some for Christmas, buddy?

405
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,127
SHIRLEY: And then Pierce did
whiteface over blackface.

406
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:57,274
No one was amused.
It's meta. Abed gets it.

407
00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:59,875
So, Troy, how was your first
real Thanksgiving?

408
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,911
No offense to Shirley,
but I don't see what the fuss is about.

409
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:04,604
Thanksgivings the war--

410
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:06,578
SHIRLEY & ANNIE:
Oh.

411
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,945
I heard your Thanksgiving
wasn't much better than mine.

412
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:12,953
So I thought we could take some time
and be grateful for our real family.

413
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:14,749
The one we chose.

414
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:16,620
Jeffrey.
JEFF: Sit, sit, sit.

415
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:17,920
SHIRLEY: Jeffrey.
JEFF: Sit, sit, sit.

416
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,222
ABED: We never got to
do a Shawshank homage.

417
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,955
Not the way I wanted to.

418
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,258
Maybe the hardest prisons
to break out of

419
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:26,664
are the ones without locks.

420
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:28,900
Wait, that doesn't make any sense.

421
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,507
After that day,
Jeff seemed like a man unburdened.

422
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:34,542
He told me about seeing his father,
about how leaving there

423
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,613
felt like breaking free
of an emotional prison he'd been in.

424
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:39,544
Something about shackles
on his heart.

425
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:42,777
To be honest, I stopped listening.
I was thinking about Christmas.

426
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:45,285
I hope we do Die Hard.
I hope it's in a restaurant.

427
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:47,924
I hope it lays out as cleanly
as it does in my dreams.

428
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,320
I hope it's cool.

429
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:50,516
Cool, cool, cool.

430
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:51,786
Cheers.
JEFF: Cheers.

431
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:54,794
Happy Thanksgiving, everyone,
including you, dean.

432
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:02,900
Hey.

433
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:13,080
Hmm.

434
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:21,315
Oh I my'

435
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:27,222
I'll have to remember this
for next year. Heh, heh.

436
00:21:28,305 --> 00:21:34,384
