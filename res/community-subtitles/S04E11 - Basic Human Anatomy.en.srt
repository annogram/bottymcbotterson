1
00:00:02,903 --> 00:00:04,549
Come on, guys, I got class
in 15 minutes.

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:06,160
This should not be
that difficult.

3
00:00:06,203 --> 00:00:08,920
We just need to figure out an idea
for our final history project.

4
00:00:08,951 --> 00:00:10,342
What we need to figure out

5
00:00:10,348 --> 00:00:12,785
is Greendale's obsession
with group assignments.

6
00:00:13,465 --> 00:00:14,734
Classic herd mentality.

7
00:00:14,753 --> 00:00:17,315
All right, Britta
doesn't have one. Who else?

8
00:00:17,483 --> 00:00:19,801
I've been told
I look like a Kennedy.

9
00:00:19,821 --> 00:00:21,437
Nope, not an idea.
That's a statement.

10
00:00:21,468 --> 00:00:23,012
Anyone not on medication?

11
00:00:23,045 --> 00:00:24,952
Jeff, we have
to take this seriously.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,785
This assignment?
This, we have to take seriously?

13
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:30,068
"Pick any moment from history
and tell me about it.

14
00:00:30,085 --> 00:00:32,381
"Be as creative as you want.
Or not. I don't care.

15
00:00:32,401 --> 00:00:33,834
Professor Cornwaaa--"

16
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:35,438
He didn't even finish
signing his name.

17
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,524
Okay, yes,
he phoned this one in,

18
00:00:37,548 --> 00:00:39,979
but my run at Valedictorian
is in jeopardy.

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,906
- As is mine.
- As is Shirley's,

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,646
and I just took one
for the team

21
00:00:43,664 --> 00:00:45,491
by accepting that C-plus
on our last history paper.

22
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:47,482
- As did I.
- As did Shirley.

23
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:50,212
So I'd think you'd want to rise to the
occasion and help get me back on top.

24
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:51,755
- Or me.
- Shirley,

25
00:00:51,793 --> 00:00:54,268
I'm speaking
for both you and me.

26
00:00:54,292 --> 00:00:58,209
Then, you might want to teach your mouth
how to say "we," "our," and "us."

27
00:00:58,932 --> 00:01:01,305
I've been told
I look like a Kennedy.

28
00:01:01,316 --> 00:01:04,016
Nope, still just a random
statement, and still useless.

29
00:01:04,046 --> 00:01:05,477
Okay.
How about this?

30
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:07,948
- We do a series of banners--
- Great, it's settled.

31
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:09,281
You don't even know
what I'm going to say!

32
00:01:09,307 --> 00:01:10,495
Don't need to.
Tomorrow is Friday,

33
00:01:10,515 --> 00:01:12,120
and I have no intention
of being here late.

34
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,823
Your banner thing
sounds doable,

35
00:01:13,862 --> 00:01:16,605
and this assignment?
Passable, so passable.

36
00:01:16,631 --> 00:01:19,028
And passable
assures my graduation,

37
00:01:19,097 --> 00:01:21,215
so we are doing doable
and passable.

38
00:01:21,231 --> 00:01:24,793
Uh, speaking of tomorrow,
Troy and Britta,

39
00:01:24,817 --> 00:01:28,137
have you decided what you're gonna
do for your one-year anniversary?

40
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,331
Of?

41
00:01:30,704 --> 00:01:32,049
Your first date?

42
00:01:32,128 --> 00:01:33,263
- Oh!
- Da-doy.

43
00:01:33,275 --> 00:01:34,319
Yeah!

44
00:01:34,331 --> 00:01:36,000
- That was a test, and you failed.
- I was just kidding.

45
00:01:36,018 --> 00:01:37,610
You guys are dating?
Man!

46
00:01:37,635 --> 00:01:40,450
Somebody's sure working her way
around the table.

47
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:41,724
Aren't you?

48
00:01:41,743 --> 00:01:44,002
Well, you should really
do something special,

49
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:45,406
- something romantic.
- Mm-hmm.

50
00:01:45,418 --> 00:01:48,954
Like go back to Senor Kevin's
for lunch, where it all began.

51
00:01:49,841 --> 00:01:51,253
Yeah, sure.

52
00:01:51,265 --> 00:01:52,167
We could do that.

53
00:01:52,204 --> 00:01:54,736
Sure, that sounds fun.

54
00:01:54,777 --> 00:01:56,009
Speaking of anniversaries,

55
00:01:56,034 --> 00:01:58,581
it is the third anniversary
of me and Abed

56
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,362
watching <i>Freaky Friday</i>
for the first time.

57
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,697
Oh...
That, you remember?

58
00:02:03,727 --> 00:02:06,257
Movie Trolley is having an "End of the
Video Store Chain Industry" sale,

59
00:02:06,275 --> 00:02:08,259
so I got you a six-pack
of "body switching" movies

60
00:02:08,265 --> 00:02:10,962
and a two-year-old box of Raisinets,
all for under five bucks.

61
00:02:10,974 --> 00:02:12,669
Whoo!

62
00:02:12,717 --> 00:02:14,723
All right, man.
<i>Change Up.</i>

63
00:02:14,757 --> 00:02:17,941
<i>13 Going On 30, 17 Again,
18 Again, Vice Versa.</i>

64
00:02:18,927 --> 00:02:20,954
- Judge Reinhold.
- Oh.

65
00:02:21,027 --> 00:02:22,776
<i>Freaky Friday.</i>

66
00:02:22,985 --> 00:02:26,390
Oh, Troy,
you are so thoughtful.

67
00:02:26,402 --> 00:02:29,888
I wish I had the capacity
for sentimentality like you do.

68
00:02:29,925 --> 00:02:33,525
Me?
I wish I was more like you.

69
00:02:33,562 --> 00:02:36,276
No emotional hang-ups,
endless cool adventures.

70
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,632
You have it so easy.

71
00:02:37,651 --> 00:02:39,463
No, you do, Troy.

72
00:02:39,483 --> 00:02:41,045
No, you do, Abed.

73
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,104
I wish I could switch
places with you for just one day!

74
00:02:52,385 --> 00:02:53,819
- Ah!
- Oh.

75
00:02:55,518 --> 00:02:59,234
Sorry.
Routine light switch check.

76
00:03:02,955 --> 00:03:04,629
- Oh.
- I thought that would work.

77
00:03:04,649 --> 00:03:06,515
Yeah, we're all floored
it didn't.

Resync for WEB-DL by Norther

88
00:03:37,477 --> 00:03:40,262
Mmm. Good morning.

89
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:42,302
Oh, and, um...

90
00:03:42,906 --> 00:03:44,921
happy one-year
anniversary.

91
00:03:44,985 --> 00:03:46,610
Yes. That would be this day.

92
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:49,356
Look, I know that
it was awkward yesterday.

93
00:03:49,389 --> 00:03:51,484
They pointed it out
and we didn't remember, but--

94
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,764
that doesn't mean that
we should feel pressure

95
00:03:53,781 --> 00:03:55,995
to make some big deal
out of it, right?

96
00:03:56,022 --> 00:03:57,990
No, I'm looking forward to it.

97
00:03:58,022 --> 00:04:01,853
Super looking forward to it.
I'm just saying...

98
00:04:02,195 --> 00:04:04,254
Yeah.

99
00:04:05,038 --> 00:04:06,858
Same page.

100
00:04:07,215 --> 00:04:09,667
Excuse me.

101
00:04:11,191 --> 00:04:13,230
Hey, buddy, wake up!

102
00:04:13,331 --> 00:04:16,706
Remember yesterday, when we faked a body
switching thing and it didn't work?

103
00:04:16,761 --> 00:04:19,117
Well, now,
it's actually worked.

104
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:24,538
- So, right now--
- I'm you and you're me.

105
00:04:27,802 --> 00:04:29,089
Oh, my God.

106
00:04:29,108 --> 00:04:31,461
This is wrinkling my brain!
And of all the days!

107
00:04:31,483 --> 00:04:33,680
I got my big, important meeting
with my study group.

108
00:04:33,704 --> 00:04:34,622
Me too.

109
00:04:34,646 --> 00:04:36,531
Oh, boy.
Here goes nothing.

110
00:04:39,702 --> 00:04:41,603
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

111
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,465
Huh.

112
00:04:44,771 --> 00:04:46,053
Okay,
so we're telling the story

113
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,209
of the American revolution
through banners.

114
00:04:48,228 --> 00:04:50,132
Everyone is responsible
for one.

115
00:04:50,192 --> 00:04:52,478
To maximize efficiency,
I've designated areas:

116
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:55,533
Colored pencils and markers,
paints, puffy paint--

117
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,534
Yes, there's a difference.

118
00:04:57,644 --> 00:05:01,473
Decoupage and glitter,
a-a-and...

119
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,235
this is the approval station,

120
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,906
where Shirley and I will decide whether
you have to start over or not.

121
00:05:05,932 --> 00:05:09,690
Annie, remember.
We're doing doable and passable.

122
00:05:09,725 --> 00:05:12,805
We're doing whatever it takes
to help us...

123
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:14,442
- Thank you.
- ...beat Leonard.

124
00:05:14,461 --> 00:05:18,411
Wait, Leonard is now the front
runner for Valedictorian?

125
00:05:18,428 --> 00:05:19,735
You're getting beat by Leonard?

126
00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:22,387
- He's so old.
- All right.

127
00:05:22,403 --> 00:05:24,110
Yes, we slipped below Leonard,

128
00:05:24,132 --> 00:05:27,343
but Annie and I are a close
three and two, respectively.

129
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:29,000
Annie is the three.

130
00:05:29,024 --> 00:05:31,341
That is what "respectively"
suggests.

131
00:05:34,956 --> 00:05:36,627
Mm-hmm.

132
00:05:38,966 --> 00:05:41,689
- Mm.
- Mm-hmm.

133
00:05:42,447 --> 00:05:44,692
Whoa! That was weird.

134
00:05:44,718 --> 00:05:45,899
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

135
00:05:45,923 --> 00:05:48,276
We didn't mean to do that.
We know exactly where we sit.

136
00:05:48,317 --> 00:05:51,612
Um, what's going on
with you guys?

137
00:05:52,004 --> 00:05:53,516
Oh, thank God, you noticed.

138
00:05:53,547 --> 00:05:55,283
Remember when we pretended
to switch bodies yesterday?

139
00:05:55,302 --> 00:05:57,312
Unfortunately, yes, dorks.

140
00:05:57,358 --> 00:05:59,286
Well, it really happened.
I'm actually Abed.

141
00:05:59,305 --> 00:06:01,425
- And I'm actually Troy.
- All right.

142
00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:03,184
I don't care who's who.

143
00:06:03,206 --> 00:06:05,504
We're all here,
and that's all I need

144
00:06:05,521 --> 00:06:07,435
to complete
this passable project

145
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:09,244
in a doable amount of time.

146
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:11,677
Wish we could help, Jeff, but in order
to switch back, we have to recreate

147
00:06:11,694 --> 00:06:13,000
the exact moment
that all this happened,

148
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:14,935
- but the DVD is missing.
- Of course it is.

149
00:06:15,033 --> 00:06:16,079
So now, I have to find it

150
00:06:16,103 --> 00:06:17,740
while Troy goes on
an anniversary date with Britta.

151
00:06:17,774 --> 00:06:18,788
What?

152
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:21,343
Oh, hey. Here's a
fun sci-fi thing.

153
00:06:21,374 --> 00:06:24,543
How about you make a banner as Troy
and you make a banner as Abed,

154
00:06:24,572 --> 00:06:25,856
and we'll be done
within the hour.

155
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:28,290
Uh, per banner, if we're lucky.

156
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,913
And that's
if we want an "A."

157
00:06:29,927 --> 00:06:31,677
Okay, you two need
to let go of the pressure

158
00:06:31,694 --> 00:06:33,346
you're putting on this project
to get an "A."

159
00:06:33,358 --> 00:06:34,889
I deserve to be number one!

160
00:06:34,911 --> 00:06:36,778
Sorry. Or me!

161
00:06:36,793 --> 00:06:38,630
Sorry.

162
00:06:38,742 --> 00:06:42,675
- I have to go talk to Troy.
- Yes, please.

163
00:06:42,701 --> 00:06:45,548
Tell your boyfriend and his
boyfriend that playtime is over.

164
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:48,433
Annie, Shirley, go find out
what's keeping Leonard on top.

165
00:06:48,446 --> 00:06:50,701
And Abed won't switch back
until we get that DVD.

166
00:06:50,713 --> 00:06:51,528
I'll deal with that.

167
00:06:51,534 --> 00:06:53,255
And then,
we are meeting back here

168
00:06:53,274 --> 00:06:54,971
and getting up
into some puffy paint

169
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,206
and doing our doable,
passable banners!

170
00:06:57,252 --> 00:06:58,759
What do you want me to do?

171
00:06:58,807 --> 00:07:00,242
Stay alive.

172
00:07:00,322 --> 00:07:01,629
Or don't.

173
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:03,113
I'm on it.

174
00:07:03,182 --> 00:07:04,427
Wait, Troy!

175
00:07:04,497 --> 00:07:06,449
- I'm Abed.
- Oh, right.

176
00:07:06,483 --> 00:07:09,452
Uh, "Troy,"
could you please excuse us?

177
00:07:10,021 --> 00:07:12,930
You were weird this morning,
and now, well, weirder.

178
00:07:12,947 --> 00:07:14,458
Are we still on
for Senor Kevin's

179
00:07:14,483 --> 00:07:16,644
or are you guys doing
this whole switchy thing?

180
00:07:16,677 --> 00:07:18,894
Actually, he's kind of
going through some stuff.

181
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,307
Oh.

182
00:07:20,338 --> 00:07:21,699
Is he having some issues

183
00:07:21,711 --> 00:07:23,211
that he's having trouble
dealing with?

184
00:07:23,252 --> 00:07:26,726
Yeah, he kind of needs this,
so he's really laying into it.

185
00:07:27,367 --> 00:07:31,040
Oh, so he might need
an almost therapist.

186
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:33,449
Perhaps I'll pencil him in
for a session,

187
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,947
you know,
after my date with Troy.

188
00:07:37,314 --> 00:07:40,122
See you later, Abed.

189
00:07:41,632 --> 00:07:43,432
Dean, I need you.

190
00:07:43,456 --> 00:07:45,606
It's happening.
Shut the door.

191
00:07:45,637 --> 00:07:47,120
- What?
- Hmm?

192
00:07:47,151 --> 00:07:50,220
Dean, I need you to give
this DVD to Troy and Abed.

193
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,754
Oh, I love those movies!

194
00:07:51,773 --> 00:07:54,552
They should make more of them.
They're a timeless tale.

195
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:55,880
Why can't you give it to them?

196
00:07:55,911 --> 00:07:57,882
Troy and Abed think
they switched bodies

197
00:07:57,901 --> 00:08:00,384
while holding
onto a <i>freaky Friday</i> DVD,

198
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,976
which, of course,
is now mysteriously missing,

199
00:08:02,995 --> 00:08:04,749
and they can't switch back
until they find it.

200
00:08:04,783 --> 00:08:07,103
Now, I'd give them
this one myself,

201
00:08:07,122 --> 00:08:09,610
but they'll think
that I bought it, which I did.

202
00:08:09,637 --> 00:08:11,005
Wait.

203
00:08:11,031 --> 00:08:12,391
How did they switch bodies?

204
00:08:13,343 --> 00:08:15,069
Well, they held
onto the DVD and said...

205
00:08:15,088 --> 00:08:17,250
I wish I could switch
places with you for just one day.

206
00:08:17,268 --> 00:08:19,028
Oh! Oh!

207
00:08:19,485 --> 00:08:22,237
Oh... Ah!

208
00:08:22,358 --> 00:08:23,858
Sorry.
Routine light switch check.

209
00:08:23,882 --> 00:08:25,466
That is not a thing!

210
00:08:25,495 --> 00:08:27,375
What?

211
00:08:27,915 --> 00:08:31,060
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

212
00:08:31,233 --> 00:08:32,504
I'm you?

213
00:08:32,523 --> 00:08:35,312
What?
No! You're not.

214
00:08:35,517 --> 00:08:38,749
Of course.
It's fricking Friday.

215
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:40,937
There's no justification
to be made,

216
00:08:40,966 --> 00:08:43,434
because it can't happen,
weirdo.

217
00:08:43,475 --> 00:08:45,969
Whatever, Dean.
Now, please leave <i>your</i> office

218
00:08:45,985 --> 00:08:50,471
so I can start to work on <i>your
</i> weird body that I'm now stuck in!

219
00:08:51,203 --> 00:08:53,567
You're not even
holding a phone!

220
00:08:56,278 --> 00:08:58,380
So, Troy...

221
00:08:58,586 --> 00:09:00,006
how's Abed coping?

222
00:09:00,046 --> 00:09:02,533
I mean, with his day in your body?

223
00:09:02,682 --> 00:09:05,256
You'd have to ask him.
I, for one, am freaked.

224
00:09:05,315 --> 00:09:06,552
Look at his arms and legs.

225
00:09:06,565 --> 00:09:08,496
He's like the pick-up sticks
of people.

226
00:09:08,736 --> 00:09:10,736
Do you think he's trying
to hide from something

227
00:09:10,749 --> 00:09:12,403
he's not understanding?

228
00:09:12,453 --> 00:09:14,604
If you're worried about Abed,
you should talk to him.

229
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:17,133
Right.
I should talk to <i>him.</i>

230
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:20,836
Well, well, well.
John "Mc-Lame."

231
00:09:20,996 --> 00:09:22,965
Never thought
I'd see your face again.

232
00:09:22,994 --> 00:09:24,543
Back for more, huh?

233
00:09:24,745 --> 00:09:26,605
I'm sorry, back for what?

234
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:27,815
Punishment.

235
00:09:27,836 --> 00:09:30,674
Last time I saw you, you got
your panties all in a wad

236
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:34,263
'cause I said <i>Die Hard</i>
was a suckfest of a movie.

237
00:09:34,471 --> 00:09:36,986
Wait, what?
You hate <i>Die Hard?</i>

238
00:09:37,004 --> 00:09:38,942
That sounds insane to me.

239
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,193
It is, without a doubt,

240
00:09:40,227 --> 00:09:43,004
the most unnecessary movie
ever made.

241
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,375
I'm not
who you think I am, man.

242
00:09:46,432 --> 00:09:48,750
What else do you hate
about the movie?

243
00:09:48,783 --> 00:09:52,120
'Cause I would love to hear
all of your opinions.

244
00:09:52,138 --> 00:09:55,224
Well, I mean,
where to even start?

245
00:09:55,243 --> 00:09:57,499
It's riddled with plot holes.
There's no logic to it.

246
00:09:57,523 --> 00:10:01,708
I would rather watch a napkin
sit and do nothing all day

247
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:06,466
than to even endure the trailer
for <i>Die Hard!</i>

248
00:10:06,548 --> 00:10:09,066
Wow, that's hatred.

249
00:10:12,285 --> 00:10:13,597
Babe, we should order.

250
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:17,213
I'm both starving and
another word for wanting food.

251
00:10:18,528 --> 00:10:19,727
Troy!

252
00:10:19,912 --> 00:10:21,595
Oh, thank God,
you've come to your senses.

253
00:10:21,605 --> 00:10:22,759
You answered to Troy.

254
00:10:22,765 --> 00:10:24,767
We're in public.
I have to. I'm Abed.

255
00:10:24,988 --> 00:10:26,282
Of course you are.

256
00:10:26,308 --> 00:10:30,006
Well, Abed, I found the DVD.
You can switch back now.

257
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,292
Nice try. That's the remake.

258
00:10:32,322 --> 00:10:34,033
In the original, the mom
and daughter simply exclaimed,

259
00:10:34,052 --> 00:10:36,490
"I wish I could switch places with
you for just one day," like we did.

260
00:10:36,505 --> 00:10:37,927
In that one,
there's a magic fortune cookie.

261
00:10:37,957 --> 00:10:39,942
Oh, I always wondered
what the differences were.

262
00:10:39,991 --> 00:10:42,873
Listen, why don't I pitch you
a remake of a remake,

263
00:10:42,884 --> 00:10:45,355
where my magic mouth
tells you drop the act

264
00:10:45,373 --> 00:10:47,200
because Abed isn't even here.

265
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,702
Then, you cough up the DVD

266
00:10:48,716 --> 00:10:50,880
and we go tell Abed
you're back in your own bodies,

267
00:10:50,902 --> 00:10:53,941
so we can go do doable
and passable banners.

268
00:10:54,003 --> 00:10:55,352
First, that's a terrible movie.

269
00:10:55,376 --> 00:10:57,645
Second, I understand why you're
frustrated, it's in your nature,

270
00:10:57,669 --> 00:10:58,732
but this is happening.

271
00:10:58,764 --> 00:11:00,745
This happened.
So, unless we find that DVD--

272
00:11:00,764 --> 00:11:02,240
Oh, no, let's go find this DVD.

273
00:11:02,253 --> 00:11:04,058
By all means,
let's waste more of my life.

274
00:11:04,076 --> 00:11:06,363
Now, we were the last ones to
leave the study room last night.

275
00:11:06,385 --> 00:11:07,604
Maybe one of the janitors
took it.

276
00:11:07,611 --> 00:11:09,129
Great.
Let's go find that janitor.

277
00:11:09,153 --> 00:11:11,971
Maybe you can switch bodies with
him, or maybe with his magic mop--

278
00:11:11,989 --> 00:11:13,203
Stop pitching.
It's not your thing.

279
00:11:13,251 --> 00:11:15,907
You're right, that's ridiculous,
unlike what we're doing.

280
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:19,809
Dean?

281
00:11:20,265 --> 00:11:21,397
Yeah, come in.

282
00:11:21,567 --> 00:11:25,131
I'd stop what I'm doing, but then
I'd be depriving you of the view.

283
00:11:31,753 --> 00:11:33,072
You're welcome.
What's up?

284
00:11:33,106 --> 00:11:35,344
Um, is this a bad time?

285
00:11:35,418 --> 00:11:37,721
Uh, I'm in Greendale,
stuck in the body

286
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,341
of a man who could be
Gollum's shadow,

287
00:11:39,359 --> 00:11:41,963
so yeah,
I'd say it's half past suck.

288
00:11:42,864 --> 00:11:43,933
Totally.

289
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,272
"Half past suck."
That's funny.

290
00:11:46,423 --> 00:11:48,457
Okay.
That's creepy.

291
00:11:48,638 --> 00:11:49,738
Uh, Dean.

292
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:51,960
We're losing to Leonard
in the race of Valedictorian,

293
00:11:51,971 --> 00:11:53,552
and we were wondering
if we could take a peek

294
00:11:53,563 --> 00:11:55,807
at his transcripts to see
how that is even possible.

295
00:11:55,909 --> 00:11:57,774
- Are you serious?
- Mm.

296
00:11:57,788 --> 00:11:59,719
You mean put my integrity
on the line?

297
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:01,548
You want me to jeopardize
the very reputation

298
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:04,283
of this school that
I've spent so long protecting?

299
00:12:04,308 --> 00:12:06,746
You're right.
We're sorry.

300
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:09,716
And that is what I would be
saying if I gave a crap.

301
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,942
Awesome!

302
00:12:16,123 --> 00:12:17,581
Ah, here's the answer.

303
00:12:17,605 --> 00:12:21,370
Back in 1968, Leonard got an "A"
in Rotary Phone Maintenance.

304
00:12:21,394 --> 00:12:24,322
Since then, he's been taking
every other class pass/fail

305
00:12:24,373 --> 00:12:26,240
to keep a perfect G.P.A.

306
00:12:26,437 --> 00:12:27,494
Well, what does this mean?

307
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,341
It means we're taking
an old man down.

308
00:12:31,453 --> 00:12:32,974
Ooh.

309
00:12:33,107 --> 00:12:34,875
You're welcome.

310
00:12:34,985 --> 00:12:38,654
- What is wrong with you?
- I don't know.

311
00:12:39,245 --> 00:12:40,459
How's your bean burrito?

312
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,023
Good. Thank you
for ordering for me.

313
00:12:43,094 --> 00:12:44,437
I know what you always get.

314
00:12:44,469 --> 00:12:47,288
- Yeah, you know me so well.
- I know a lot about you.

315
00:12:47,312 --> 00:12:49,129
I know you grind your teeth
at night, it keeps me up.

316
00:12:49,142 --> 00:12:51,024
- I know about your tattoo.
- Which one?

317
00:12:51,051 --> 00:12:54,681
The Greenpeace one you haven't gotten
yet because you're afraid of needles.

318
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,966
Did Troy tell you these things?

319
00:12:56,995 --> 00:12:58,361
I am Troy.

320
00:12:59,048 --> 00:13:00,706
Well, it must upset Abed

321
00:13:00,725 --> 00:13:03,403
to hear all of this
relationship talk.

322
00:13:03,553 --> 00:13:05,841
- He doesn't seem to care.
- Maybe.

323
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:08,932
But maybe he doesn't like
talking to you about us.

324
00:13:08,985 --> 00:13:11,143
I could see that
causing him to act out.

325
00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:12,530
Nah, I don't see that.

326
00:13:12,576 --> 00:13:14,225
I don't think
he's that invested in us.

327
00:13:14,253 --> 00:13:17,690
- But he talks to you about us.
- I talk to him.

328
00:13:19,624 --> 00:13:22,330
What do you say
when you talk to him about us?

329
00:13:22,347 --> 00:13:24,326
Do you tell him
that things are good?

330
00:13:24,475 --> 00:13:25,918
I don't know.

331
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,182
Are they?

332
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:29,427
- Well, what you think?
- Well,

333
00:13:29,479 --> 00:13:32,109
I guess I wonder why we didn't
remember our anniversary.

334
00:13:32,441 --> 00:13:34,946
- Not everybody's Annie.
- No, but I don't know.

335
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:38,057
Seems like, you know, that
would be special to us, like,

336
00:13:38,081 --> 00:13:39,307
especially if things were good.

337
00:13:39,331 --> 00:13:42,553
- Something we'd want to celebrate.
- Well, we are.

338
00:13:42,687 --> 00:13:44,562
Are we?

339
00:13:46,658 --> 00:13:48,047
Yes, Lord Brickell,

340
00:13:48,066 --> 00:13:51,565
I was indeed
down by the stables.

341
00:13:52,427 --> 00:13:54,836
Damn, man.
You ever heard of knocking?

342
00:13:54,852 --> 00:13:56,957
Yup, just heard it,
when I did it a second ago.

343
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:59,330
They've seen too much!
Let's kill them!

344
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:01,011
Stand down, crazy Schmidt.

345
00:14:01,062 --> 00:14:03,037
What we're doing here
is none of their business.

346
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:04,773
We're having murder mystery
night during the day.

347
00:14:04,855 --> 00:14:06,751
I was fine with
"None of your business."

348
00:14:06,802 --> 00:14:08,501
We're looking
for a <i>Freaky Friday</i> DVD.

349
00:14:08,527 --> 00:14:11,035
Oh, I love those movies.
They should make more of those--

350
00:14:11,048 --> 00:14:13,770
Nope. We left it
in study room "F" last night.

351
00:14:13,817 --> 00:14:15,842
Well, everything we find goes
straight to the lost and found.

352
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:17,071
Great, show us.

353
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,732
And the "Wasting My Life" tour
continues.

354
00:14:20,221 --> 00:14:21,919
Leonard!

355
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:24,700
We just looked
at your transcript.

356
00:14:25,361 --> 00:14:28,687
I knew this day would come.
I'm outta here.

357
00:14:29,732 --> 00:14:32,173
There you go.
My work here is done.

358
00:14:32,207 --> 00:14:33,385
You're one and two again.

359
00:14:33,403 --> 00:14:36,605
Now, you can direct your anger
and resentment at each other.

360
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:37,730
Congrats.

361
00:14:37,756 --> 00:14:40,346
- Classic wrap-up.
- Shut up, Leonard!

362
00:14:40,364 --> 00:14:41,976
I've got a picture
of your old nose!

363
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,061
- It was a lateral move!
- Dean!

364
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:44,893
Dean...

365
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:47,808
- Annie.
- Why is this happening?

366
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:53,163
Holy--makes complete sense
at this school!

367
00:14:53,412 --> 00:14:55,418
FYI, one of these piles
is load-bearing,

368
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,381
so, uh, yeah, watch that.

369
00:14:57,905 --> 00:14:59,625
Jeez.

370
00:14:59,962 --> 00:15:02,350
This is gonna be harder
than I thought.

371
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:03,921
This DVD isn't gonna
find itself.

372
00:15:03,938 --> 00:15:07,296
And neither are we, Troy,
because it's not in here,

373
00:15:07,313 --> 00:15:08,533
and you know that.

374
00:15:08,572 --> 00:15:09,873
This is dumb.

375
00:15:09,962 --> 00:15:12,342
Why are you so committed
to this bit?

376
00:15:12,408 --> 00:15:14,763
If you're really
a friend to Abed, to me,

377
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,463
then you'll end it, now.

378
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:17,876
Sorry.

379
00:15:18,114 --> 00:15:20,270
I have to keep going, for Troy.

380
00:15:20,623 --> 00:15:22,748
You don't have to dig
through all this stuff. I will.

381
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:25,095
I know it isn't your problem.

382
00:15:25,477 --> 00:15:26,928
I'm just glad I'm here.

383
00:15:26,962 --> 00:15:29,000
This is the sweeter end
of the deal.

384
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,791
Troy still has to go
on his date with Britta.

385
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,623
I don't understand
this whole relationship thing

386
00:15:35,028 --> 00:15:37,926
or why Troy would even
want to be in one.

387
00:15:39,378 --> 00:15:42,046
How long
have you felt this way?

388
00:15:42,072 --> 00:15:43,302
Or at least,

389
00:15:43,315 --> 00:15:46,432
how long have you
been talking to Abed about this?

390
00:15:46,994 --> 00:15:48,716
Not that long.

391
00:15:48,746 --> 00:15:51,239
It's more lately, I guess.

392
00:15:51,303 --> 00:15:52,884
It's felt different,

393
00:15:53,181 --> 00:15:54,907
like we're working at it
too hard.

394
00:15:54,931 --> 00:15:57,476
And he doesn't think
it should be.

395
00:15:57,688 --> 00:16:00,859
It should be easy,
but he says it isn't.

396
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:02,912
It feels like we're
just going through the motions.

397
00:16:02,933 --> 00:16:05,109
Because he's afraid
if he doesn't, it just ends.

398
00:16:05,142 --> 00:16:06,673
Then what?

399
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,988
What if they're
not friends anymore?

400
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:11,826
He'd hate that.
He'd hate himself.

401
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,345
I don't want to lose
what we had.

402
00:16:13,374 --> 00:16:17,360
So he's here, at this point,
not knowing how to talk to her,

403
00:16:17,549 --> 00:16:20,404
not knowing how to tell her
that he wants to break up.

404
00:16:21,346 --> 00:16:24,921
Wait, are you
breaking up with me?

405
00:16:25,557 --> 00:16:27,844
I think so?

406
00:16:33,067 --> 00:16:35,334
I'm sorry, Jeff. I shouldn't
have brought you down here.

407
00:16:35,352 --> 00:16:36,908
Into an of this.

408
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:39,140
Especially for a bit.
I know you don't respect them.

409
00:16:39,153 --> 00:16:41,240
That's true. They're dumb,
and I stand by that,

410
00:16:41,264 --> 00:16:43,163
but committing to them isn't.

411
00:16:43,264 --> 00:16:46,432
I wish I had the courage to
commit to a bit like you, Abed,

412
00:16:46,474 --> 00:16:49,173
or to a relationship,
like Troy.

413
00:16:49,264 --> 00:16:50,727
Committing is hard,

414
00:16:50,767 --> 00:16:52,774
because we're all scared
of what happens

415
00:16:52,798 --> 00:16:55,562
when we find out we committed
to the wrong thing,

416
00:16:55,591 --> 00:16:59,246
but there's no shame
in what Troy's done.

417
00:16:59,869 --> 00:17:03,975
He put himself out there
and he really tried,

418
00:17:04,221 --> 00:17:06,463
and that proves he cares.

419
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:09,623
That said,
and as hard as it may seem,

420
00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:13,766
right now, Troy needs
to show he cares.

421
00:17:13,789 --> 00:17:17,747
He needs to put himself
out there and own how he feels.

422
00:17:18,076 --> 00:17:19,545
That...

423
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:21,738
proves he's a man.

424
00:17:24,471 --> 00:17:26,516
So...

425
00:17:27,521 --> 00:17:29,190
Yeah, I don't think
this is the way

426
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,066
either of us
thought this would go.

427
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,642
No,

428
00:17:32,736 --> 00:17:34,221
I can't say that I did.

429
00:17:34,244 --> 00:17:36,338
I mean, not this,

430
00:17:36,451 --> 00:17:38,749
not us here.

431
00:17:42,972 --> 00:17:45,040
But I can say that
whenever you guys switch back

432
00:17:45,052 --> 00:17:47,275
to your original bodies,
I want to thank Abed

433
00:17:47,292 --> 00:17:50,730
for being such a good friend
to both of us.

434
00:17:51,858 --> 00:17:53,577
Troy, wait.

435
00:17:53,703 --> 00:17:54,984
Don't do it like this.

436
00:17:55,009 --> 00:17:56,596
I understand why
you had to go high concept,

437
00:17:56,626 --> 00:17:59,709
because you're scared,
but Britta deserves better.

438
00:17:59,876 --> 00:18:01,290
Troy,

439
00:18:01,429 --> 00:18:03,429
it's time.

440
00:18:06,328 --> 00:18:08,596
I wish I had my own body back!

441
00:18:13,236 --> 00:18:15,752
Sorry,
routine light switch check.

442
00:18:22,282 --> 00:18:24,200
- Oh.
- Hmm.

443
00:18:29,155 --> 00:18:31,652
Oh, I've been meaning
to see this.

444
00:18:32,176 --> 00:18:35,945
First, the easiest part,
because it's the most obvious.

445
00:18:36,146 --> 00:18:38,013
I'm sorry.

446
00:18:38,273 --> 00:18:41,339
I think I proved today
that I'm not ready for this.

447
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:44,152
I wanted it to work.
I did.

448
00:18:44,173 --> 00:18:45,480
I care about you so much,

449
00:18:45,507 --> 00:18:49,134
and I love being around you.

450
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:53,201
I just think I'm better
as your friend,

451
00:18:53,775 --> 00:18:57,470
because that I know
I can be good at.

452
00:19:00,959 --> 00:19:03,753
So I'm number two again,
which is what it is.

453
00:19:03,785 --> 00:19:06,574
But you know, if I'm not
going to be Valedictorian,

454
00:19:06,664 --> 00:19:09,039
- I'm glad it will be you.
- Mm, me too.

455
00:19:09,057 --> 00:19:12,134
You mean you hope it's
me if it's not you,

456
00:19:12,145 --> 00:19:13,978
or that you're glad it's you?

457
00:19:14,104 --> 00:19:15,707
Yes.

458
00:19:16,094 --> 00:19:17,807
Thanks for everything
you did for me today.

459
00:19:17,818 --> 00:19:19,104
I'm sorry I pulled you into it.

460
00:19:19,133 --> 00:19:20,884
That was my problem, not yours.

461
00:19:20,957 --> 00:19:23,549
It's the best way someone's
ever woken me up in my life.

462
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:25,834
How was lunch?

463
00:19:26,527 --> 00:19:28,457
It was good.
It really was.

464
00:19:28,481 --> 00:19:30,133
I'll tell you about it later.

465
00:19:30,185 --> 00:19:31,453
Oh, there you are.

466
00:19:31,479 --> 00:19:34,740
I got bored waiting, so I went
ahead and did our whole project.

467
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:37,174
Pierce, no offense,

468
00:19:37,199 --> 00:19:40,659
but banners are kind of
my specialt--oh.

469
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:43,405
Holy--makes no sense
whatsoever.

470
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:46,972
Whole thing
took 25 minutes tops.

471
00:19:47,552 --> 00:19:49,087
Huh.

472
00:19:49,295 --> 00:19:51,344
Early weekend?
Early weekend? Early weekend?

473
00:19:51,372 --> 00:19:54,512
Guys, I need to apologize
for my behavior today.

474
00:19:54,525 --> 00:19:56,231
When I switched bodies
with Jeffrey...

475
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,384
- Nope.
- I thought I knew

476
00:19:57,403 --> 00:19:59,507
what it would be like
to have Jeffrey inside of me...

477
00:19:59,538 --> 00:20:01,794
- That did not happen.
- But as it turns out,

478
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:04,132
- having Jeffrey inside of me...
- Nope again.

479
00:20:04,155 --> 00:20:06,015
...only brought out
the worst in me.

480
00:20:06,045 --> 00:20:09,059
Which is to say,
having Jeffrey inside of me...

481
00:20:09,077 --> 00:20:11,568
- No one was inside of anyone!
- ...was wrong...

482
00:20:13,364 --> 00:20:15,343
- to have Jeffrey inside of me.
- Shut up!

483
00:20:15,366 --> 00:20:16,655
So I'm sorry.

484
00:20:17,138 --> 00:20:18,708
Now, if you'll excuse me,

485
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,555
I scolded Leonard today,

486
00:20:20,671 --> 00:20:23,038
and according
to Greendale bylaws,

487
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,887
I now have to grant him
three wishes.

488
00:20:26,156 --> 00:20:29,501
Um, we need to get scolded
by the Dean immediately.

489
00:20:29,536 --> 00:20:31,369
Mm-hmm.

490
00:20:46,498 --> 00:20:49,677
Oh, man. Football is fun.
That is an interest I have.

491
00:20:49,703 --> 00:20:53,405
Also plumbing and air conditioning
are things I think about.

492
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:56,588
Come on, what are we...
what's happening?

493
00:20:57,143 --> 00:20:59,680
- I'm sorry, keep rolling.
- Okay, come on.

494
00:20:59,741 --> 00:21:01,840
- Feetball's... feetball?
- Feetball?

495
00:21:01,869 --> 00:21:03,151
- Did I say...
- Dorks!

496
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:05,477
Stop doing outtakes.
You switched your bodies last week.

497
00:21:05,718 --> 00:21:08,326
Hey guys, I just wanna apologize...

498
00:21:09,846 --> 00:21:12,546
Oh my God.
Hey, Dean, walk much, am I right?

499
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:14,980
I'm sorry, I never do this.

500
00:21:15,189 --> 00:21:16,599
Dean, we stopped playing outtakes.

501
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:17,573
Oh, okay.

502
00:21:17,605 --> 00:21:18,597
Yeah, we did that.

503
00:21:18,626 --> 00:21:20,843
Oh, no worries.
Thanks for including me.

504
00:21:22,246 --> 00:21:25,476
Ohhh!
No, still not doing it.

505
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:32,535
