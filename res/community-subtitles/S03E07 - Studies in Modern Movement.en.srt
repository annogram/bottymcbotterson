1
00:00:04,443 --> 00:00:06,735
I'm so glad you're moving
out of this neighborhood Annie.

2
00:00:06,737 --> 00:00:09,066
Some dude peed on my car
while I was parking it.

3
00:00:09,865 --> 00:00:11,849
Oh, you met spaghetti!

4
00:00:11,884 --> 00:00:14,885
- Yeah, I won't miss him.
- Speaking of missing people,

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,422
how did Jeff dodge this
bullet...Of friendship.

6
00:00:18,457 --> 00:00:21,059
He said he was
under the weather.

7
00:00:21,094 --> 00:00:23,428
- Pshaw!
- Thanks for helping.

8
00:00:23,463 --> 00:00:24,829
Can you imagine how much fun
this is gonna be?

9
00:00:24,864 --> 00:00:26,347
Me living with Troy and Abed?

10
00:00:26,382 --> 00:00:28,265
Yeah, there'll be
a honeymoon phase,

11
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,969
but it won't be long
till you hate their guts.

12
00:00:31,003 --> 00:00:33,037
What's this whittle guy's name?

13
00:00:33,072 --> 00:00:35,707
I'll never hate Troy and Abed.

14
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,776
Oh, my God, I forgot.
You're 20.

15
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,610
Don't worry.
It's natural.

16
00:00:39,645 --> 00:00:41,045
When you become
roommates with friends,

17
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:43,148
the things you love about
them become the things

18
00:00:43,182 --> 00:00:45,484
that make you want
to smother them with a pillow.

19
00:00:45,518 --> 00:00:48,152
But...
That's unacceptable to me.

20
00:00:48,186 --> 00:00:52,524
Then...I'm lying?

21
00:00:55,561 --> 00:00:56,527
Forgetting something?

22
00:00:56,561 --> 00:00:59,497
Yeah.

23
00:01:02,417 --> 00:01:04,034
Yeah, like I'm gonna
get sick of this.

24
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:05,504
Wh-what wh-what?

25
00:01:05,537 --> 00:01:07,138
We're here to help you move...

26
00:01:07,173 --> 00:01:08,439
on the dance floor.

27
00:01:08,474 --> 00:01:10,174
- Nice! Tweet it!
- Tweeting it.

28
00:01:10,209 --> 00:01:11,575
- What are you tweeting?
- Everything.

29
00:01:11,611 --> 00:01:13,227
We're live tweeting
Annie's move on Twitter.

30
00:01:13,262 --> 00:01:14,596
Hashtag #Annie'sMove.

31
00:01:14,647 --> 00:01:16,081
How fun.

32
00:01:16,114 --> 00:01:18,216
How was I supposed to know
it was a handicap space?

33
00:01:18,251 --> 00:01:20,652
Because the man in
the wheelchair was yelling it.

34
00:01:20,686 --> 00:01:23,905
Oh, yeah, and he doesn't
have an agenda.

35
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:26,224
Hold it.

36
00:01:26,242 --> 00:01:28,225
- Where's Winger?
- Sick.

37
00:01:28,243 --> 00:01:29,444
Pshaw!

38
00:01:29,495 --> 00:01:31,396
Yeah, I'm calling him.

39
00:01:31,414 --> 00:01:35,133
Hello?

40
00:01:35,168 --> 00:01:36,951
So you're sick, huh?

41
00:01:37,003 --> 00:01:38,469
That's what they tell me.

42
00:01:41,807 --> 00:01:43,908
Well, Britta,
you got me all figured out.

43
00:01:43,942 --> 00:01:45,710
Well I can tell
you're not in bed.

44
00:01:45,743 --> 00:01:46,878
That's right, Britta.

45
00:01:46,912 --> 00:01:48,180
I'm pretending
to be violently ill

46
00:01:48,213 --> 00:01:50,015
to avoid lifting a few boxes.

47
00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:51,748
Because I'm 13.

48
00:01:51,766 --> 00:01:54,134
And who's your primary care
physician, Mr. Winger?

49
00:01:54,186 --> 00:01:56,888
Uh, Dr. Schroeder.
S-c-h.

50
00:01:56,923 --> 00:01:58,622
Um, do you want to see
my insurance card?

51
00:01:58,658 --> 00:02:00,090
Please.

52
00:02:00,108 --> 00:02:01,358
Wait, are you at a hospital?

53
00:02:01,394 --> 00:02:04,596
No, I'm at The Gap.

54
00:02:04,629 --> 00:02:05,596
You hear that?

55
00:02:05,631 --> 00:02:06,965
That's not a heart monitor.

56
00:02:06,998 --> 00:02:09,167
It's a machine telling me
I'm low on khakis.

57
00:02:09,201 --> 00:02:13,070
Dr. Tarpenian to radiology,
Dr. Tarpenian.

58
00:02:13,104 --> 00:02:15,122
Crap, I- I'm sorry.
I just assumed--

59
00:02:15,157 --> 00:02:16,875
Whatever.
I don't blame you.

60
00:02:16,908 --> 00:02:18,276
I've lied before.

61
00:02:18,294 --> 00:02:20,078
It's probably karma
that I'm sick.

62
00:02:20,111 --> 00:02:22,213
But believe me,
if you had what I have,

63
00:02:22,247 --> 00:02:24,132
you'd rather be moving boxes.

64
00:02:24,165 --> 00:02:25,966
Okay, feel better.

65
00:02:26,002 --> 00:02:27,117
Sorry.

66
00:02:27,152 --> 00:02:29,454
Yeah, I'll see
you guys on Monday.

67
00:02:31,173 --> 00:02:32,789
You are fantastic.

68
00:02:32,807 --> 00:02:34,091
So are you.

69
00:02:34,126 --> 00:02:35,293
What are you doing after this?

70
00:02:35,328 --> 00:02:38,028
Probably trying
a couple of boot-cuts.

71
00:02:38,063 --> 00:02:39,030
But after that...

72
00:02:39,064 --> 00:02:43,835
Maybe, like, a blazer?

00:02:43,868 --> 00:02:47,822

80
00:03:12,131 --> 00:03:14,098
How are we out of packing tape?

81
00:03:14,133 --> 00:03:15,449
I don't know.

82
00:03:15,484 --> 00:03:17,401
I think I left some
in the bathroom.

83
00:03:20,673 --> 00:03:24,609
Nope, uh, nothing in here.

84
00:03:24,627 --> 00:03:26,411
You guys!
You used all of it?

85
00:03:26,444 --> 00:03:29,663
I had a big breakfast.

86
00:03:29,715 --> 00:03:32,850
Nice. Tweeting it!

87
00:03:32,884 --> 00:03:34,151
Okay, there might be
a slight danger

88
00:03:34,186 --> 00:03:35,787
I will end up hating them.

89
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,122
Man children...
Can't live with them,

90
00:03:37,156 --> 00:03:38,956
can't leave them alone
with your tape.

91
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:41,475
Britta, don't make jokes.
You're bad at it.

92
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:44,128
Also, I can't afford
to live anywhere else.

93
00:03:44,163 --> 00:03:47,432
And everything is riding
on this, and I'm out of tape--

94
00:03:47,466 --> 00:03:50,602
Annie, listen.
Breathe.

95
00:03:50,635 --> 00:03:51,703
When I was in Amsterdam,

96
00:03:51,736 --> 00:03:53,521
I met this guy
who ate too many shrooms

97
00:03:53,572 --> 00:03:56,039
and fell out of a window
at the Anne Frank house.

98
00:03:56,074 --> 00:03:57,574
Oh, no, no, he's fine.

99
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:01,162
The doctor said that the drugs
made his body just limp enough

100
00:04:01,197 --> 00:04:02,680
to keep him from
breaking his neck.

101
00:04:02,715 --> 00:04:04,382
Britta, I don't see
what your taste in men

102
00:04:04,417 --> 00:04:05,550
has to do with my situation.

103
00:04:05,584 --> 00:04:06,918
What I'm saying, Annie,

104
00:04:06,951 --> 00:04:08,919
is that if you're gonna live
with two guys like that,

105
00:04:08,954 --> 00:04:11,021
you've gotta learn to go limp.

106
00:04:11,056 --> 00:04:12,507
Loosey-goosey.

107
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,491
Shake it all up.

108
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:16,377
- Limp...
- Loosey-goosey.

109
00:04:16,428 --> 00:04:19,096
Okay... New Annie.

110
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,798
Going with the flow.

111
00:04:20,832 --> 00:04:23,134
Loosey-goosey-- Is it
loosey-goosey or goosey-loosey?

112
00:04:23,168 --> 00:04:25,002
Is that hyphenated?
You know what?

113
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:26,521
Don't tell me.

114
00:04:26,555 --> 00:04:28,889
I don't need to know.

115
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,509
Bro...Heim.

116
00:04:31,526 --> 00:04:33,845
Okay, go.

117
00:04:33,862 --> 00:04:35,579
- Aah!
- Didn't feel it.

118
00:04:35,613 --> 00:04:39,483
What... a fun use

119
00:04:39,518 --> 00:04:41,853
you found for my bubble wrap.

120
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,021
I know! We have to
sell this to the military.

121
00:04:44,038 --> 00:04:46,156
Yeah, baby.

122
00:04:46,191 --> 00:04:47,792
Yah, babuh.

123
00:04:47,826 --> 00:04:49,409
Here's the other tape gun.
Think fast!

124
00:04:49,461 --> 00:04:52,262
Ooh!

125
00:04:52,298 --> 00:04:54,432
You broke my pluggy thing.

126
00:04:54,466 --> 00:04:55,716
No worries.

127
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,101
That's what
the security deposit is for.

128
00:04:58,137 --> 00:04:59,370
Hashtag #ThatIsAll.

129
00:04:59,387 --> 00:05:01,588
Oh no, you're not
letting some slumlord

130
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:02,757
take your hard-earned money.

131
00:05:02,807 --> 00:05:04,259
I'll fix it.

132
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,375
I used to do that
kind of thing all the time

133
00:05:05,411 --> 00:05:07,110
- when I was a slumlord.
- Really, Pierce?

134
00:05:07,146 --> 00:05:08,879
My landlord's coming by
to do the inspection at 5:00.

135
00:05:08,913 --> 00:05:10,214
Do you think you're gonna
have it done by then?

136
00:05:10,249 --> 00:05:12,766
Easy peasy, George and Weezie.

137
00:05:12,817 --> 00:05:14,718
This is probably the last
that'll fit in our car.

138
00:05:14,737 --> 00:05:15,720
I'll help you.

139
00:05:15,737 --> 00:05:18,355
But not in an uptight way.

140
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:20,391
I'm very concerned about
this living situation.

141
00:05:20,425 --> 00:05:21,992
<i>I mean, I've seen enough
episodes of Friends</i>

142
00:05:22,026 --> 00:05:24,028
to know that cohabitation
leads to sex, drugs

143
00:05:24,062 --> 00:05:26,297
<i>and something a parade magazine
called Schwimmer-fatigue.</i>

144
00:05:26,331 --> 00:05:27,831
Good for you, Shirley.
What's the saying?

145
00:05:27,867 --> 00:05:30,033
If you can't stop 'em,
judge 'em?

146
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:31,935
Well, somebody's gotta be
this group's moral compass.

147
00:05:31,971 --> 00:05:33,771
And that somebody
has to be you, right?

148
00:05:33,805 --> 00:05:36,707
Because by moral compass,
you mean Shirley's religion.

149
00:05:36,742 --> 00:05:37,759
Well...

150
00:05:37,793 --> 00:05:39,409
Want a ride?

151
00:05:39,444 --> 00:05:41,012
Well, if this is a forecast
of the conversation,

152
00:05:41,045 --> 00:05:42,413
I will ride with somebody else.

153
00:05:42,447 --> 00:05:44,465
Don't worry, Shirley.

154
00:05:44,516 --> 00:05:45,617
Keep me company while I fix this

155
00:05:45,651 --> 00:05:47,018
and I'll give you
a ride over there.

156
00:05:49,187 --> 00:05:52,255
Britta!

157
00:05:52,274 --> 00:05:54,591
Well, hey there, stranger!

158
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:57,127
What a coincidence, huh?

159
00:05:57,161 --> 00:05:59,564
<i>This is just like that, uh,
Lake House movie.</i>

160
00:05:59,598 --> 00:06:01,833
I can only assume.
Even I have limits.

00:06:03,619 --> 00:06:06,704
Jeff, it's Saturday.
Call me Craig.

163
00:06:06,738 --> 00:06:09,324
Off campus,
I'm just a craigular Joe.

164
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,442
Ooh, what'd you get?

165
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:14,144
Ah, now I feel like I have to
head back out there.

166
00:06:14,178 --> 00:06:15,547
Dean--uh, Craig,

167
00:06:15,581 --> 00:06:17,148
it's nice to see you
but I actually have to run.

168
00:06:17,182 --> 00:06:19,634
Oh, yeah, you're probably
heading to help Annie move.

169
00:06:19,668 --> 00:06:21,802
Right?

170
00:06:21,836 --> 00:06:24,721
Oh, I follow Troy
and Abed on Twitter.

171
00:06:24,757 --> 00:06:27,158
Looks like Annie's moving
and you're...

172
00:06:27,192 --> 00:06:28,927
Sick at the hospital?

173
00:06:28,961 --> 00:06:30,928
Curious.

174
00:06:30,963 --> 00:06:32,196
I might head there myself.

175
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,665
I could tell them you said hi.

176
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:34,932
I'd rather you didn't.

177
00:06:34,966 --> 00:06:37,569
Well, maybe I won't have time.

178
00:06:37,603 --> 00:06:39,637
Especially if we're doing...

179
00:06:39,654 --> 00:06:41,706
Lunch?

180
00:06:47,745 --> 00:06:51,281
Yeah, but your religion
isn't the same as morality.

181
00:06:51,317 --> 00:06:53,817
And calling me amoral
because I'm atheistic

182
00:06:53,851 --> 00:06:55,319
is religious persecution.

183
00:06:55,353 --> 00:06:56,670
How can I religiously
persecute you?

184
00:06:56,704 --> 00:06:58,255
You don't have a religion.

185
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:00,625
Oh, look!
A hitchhiker.

186
00:07:00,658 --> 00:07:02,026
A person in need.

187
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,677
Oh, my God.
What am I doing?

188
00:07:03,711 --> 00:07:05,629
I'm pulling over
to help him out.

189
00:07:05,663 --> 00:07:06,964
Do not help him out.

190
00:07:06,999 --> 00:07:08,533
Why, because it
proves the existence

191
00:07:08,567 --> 00:07:09,968
of secular morality?

192
00:07:10,002 --> 00:07:11,569
No, because he looks stinky.

193
00:07:11,603 --> 00:07:17,557
Judge not, Shirley.
Judge not.

194
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,310
I really appreciate it,
thank you.

195
00:07:19,343 --> 00:07:21,112
Where are you headed,
fellow human?

196
00:07:21,146 --> 00:07:22,112
Riverside Falls?

197
00:07:22,146 --> 00:07:23,447
That's 40 minutes away.

198
00:07:23,481 --> 00:07:26,617
Oh, I guess I'm just
a really good person.

199
00:07:26,651 --> 00:07:27,785
I knew you were.

200
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:29,987
I could see the kindness
in your faces.

201
00:07:30,021 --> 00:07:31,872
I assume you've both
accepted Jesus Christ

202
00:07:31,906 --> 00:07:33,156
as your lord and savior?

203
00:07:33,192 --> 00:07:36,494
Oh, that's nice.

204
00:07:39,564 --> 00:07:41,331
Ow!

205
00:07:45,603 --> 00:07:48,505
Needed a coat of paint anyway.

206
00:07:50,207 --> 00:07:53,978
Welcome, Annie,
to your new home.

207
00:07:54,012 --> 00:07:56,480
Okay...To reacquaint you,
there's the bathroom,

208
00:07:56,514 --> 00:07:59,850
kitchen,
and, of course, our bedroom.

209
00:07:59,884 --> 00:08:01,218
And if the room's a rockin'
please come a knockin'

210
00:08:01,235 --> 00:08:02,569
because there's something
probably terribly wrong.

211
00:08:02,603 --> 00:08:04,237
Yeah, we're pretty chill
in there.

212
00:08:04,273 --> 00:08:06,557
Mm-hmm, now let's go
see your room.

213
00:08:10,329 --> 00:08:11,528
What's that?

214
00:08:11,562 --> 00:08:13,764
That is your room.

215
00:08:13,798 --> 00:08:16,100
You said this was
a two bedroom.

216
00:08:16,134 --> 00:08:18,252
It is, one, two.

217
00:08:18,286 --> 00:08:19,336
Yours is a blanket fort.

218
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,572
An awesome blanket fort.

219
00:08:21,606 --> 00:08:23,173
But still highly flammable
so no candles.

220
00:08:23,207 --> 00:08:25,125
What do you think?

221
00:08:25,177 --> 00:08:27,411
- Tweet it?
- Tweeting it!

222
00:08:33,018 --> 00:08:34,207
I am not surprised
you're so taken aback.

223
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:35,592
This apartment
is where dreams come true.

224
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:38,431
We spent our whole lives
being told that blanket forts

225
00:08:38,562 --> 00:08:40,096
are only for special occasions,

226
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,065
like sleepovers
or when uncles die.

227
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:43,099
But that's a lie, Annie.

228
00:08:43,134 --> 00:08:44,834
You can live
in a fort of blankets

229
00:08:44,869 --> 00:08:47,037
all day, every night.

230
00:08:47,071 --> 00:08:49,338
It's so awesome.

231
00:08:49,356 --> 00:08:51,490
I'm surprised you guys haven't
chosen to live in one.

232
00:08:51,524 --> 00:08:52,975
Well, we'll be spending
enough time in yours.

233
00:08:53,009 --> 00:08:55,044
I mean, it's where
we're gonna watch tv.

234
00:08:55,078 --> 00:08:56,679
Right.

235
00:08:59,984 --> 00:09:01,951
Uh, what's that door
over there?

236
00:09:01,985 --> 00:09:03,052
That's not a bedroom?

237
00:09:03,086 --> 00:09:05,422
- No.
- Oh, no, no, no.

238
00:09:05,456 --> 00:09:06,456
Is it a linen closet?

239
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,224
Something like that.

240
00:09:08,259 --> 00:09:10,225
What's a linen closet?

241
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,895
A siesta salad and an iced tea.

242
00:09:12,929 --> 00:09:16,066
<i>Excelente.
And for you?</i>

243
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,933
Ahem.

244
00:09:20,638 --> 00:09:23,472
- The gentleman...
- Oh...

245
00:09:23,506 --> 00:09:25,707
will have
a top notch-os

246
00:09:25,725 --> 00:09:27,043
and a watermelon Margarita.

247
00:09:27,061 --> 00:09:29,078
Thank you, Jeffrey.

248
00:09:29,113 --> 00:09:31,480
So, any brothers or sisters?

249
00:09:31,514 --> 00:09:32,481
And we'll take the check too.

250
00:09:32,515 --> 00:09:35,051
Oh!
What's the rush?

251
00:09:35,086 --> 00:09:37,419
We're eating lunch,
and then I'm leaving.

252
00:09:37,455 --> 00:09:38,687
Okay.
I just hope that I don't

253
00:09:38,721 --> 00:09:40,490
bump into
your study group on Monday.

254
00:09:40,524 --> 00:09:42,792
And I pray they don't ask me

255
00:09:42,826 --> 00:09:44,561
who I saw at the mall
on Saturday.

256
00:09:44,595 --> 00:09:46,895
Because,
unlike a certain someone,

257
00:09:46,931 --> 00:09:49,832
I just don't think I could lie
to those sweet people.

258
00:09:49,866 --> 00:09:51,567
Dean, this is blackmail.

259
00:09:51,601 --> 00:09:53,503
Ah! Call me Craig.

260
00:09:53,537 --> 00:09:56,206
And call blackmail
"a day at the mall with Craig."

261
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,841
Because that's all
I require, Jeffrey.

262
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:01,378
You and I are going
to have some fun.

263
00:10:01,412 --> 00:10:02,812
And create a few memories.

264
00:10:02,846 --> 00:10:04,630
And I suggest you get into it.

265
00:10:04,682 --> 00:10:08,083
Because that counts.

266
00:10:08,119 --> 00:10:11,855
A song for the señor, señor?

267
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,990
<i>Adiós amores.</i>

268
00:10:15,025 --> 00:10:19,611
Oh, what a surprise.

269
00:10:19,647 --> 00:10:22,899
Mmm!

270
00:10:27,238 --> 00:10:28,988
Jeez.

271
00:10:54,065 --> 00:10:57,399
This is actually
quite calming for some reason.

272
00:10:57,434 --> 00:11:00,803
And that's when I realized
I had to forgive them.

273
00:11:00,837 --> 00:11:02,105
That's a beautiful story.

274
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:04,190
So inspiring how he came
to find the lord.

275
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,241
- Isn't it, Britta?
- Yeah, yeah.

276
00:11:06,277 --> 00:11:07,844
Well, I didn't exactly have
to find the lord.

277
00:11:07,878 --> 00:11:09,078
He was inside me.

278
00:11:09,113 --> 00:11:11,014
Amen!
What's your name, friend?

279
00:11:11,048 --> 00:11:12,014
- Jesus.
- Oh.

280
00:11:12,048 --> 00:11:13,249
Are you Latino?

281
00:11:13,283 --> 00:11:16,152
No, my child.
I am him.

282
00:11:16,187 --> 00:11:17,153
You're what now?

283
00:11:17,187 --> 00:11:18,754
I am the one true son of God.

284
00:11:18,788 --> 00:11:20,423
I was sent here
to save humanity.

285
00:11:20,457 --> 00:11:21,890
Oh, no.

286
00:11:21,926 --> 00:11:24,677
Well, it is a pleasure
to have you in my car, Jesus.

287
00:11:24,711 --> 00:11:26,495
Britta, stop.
It's not funny now.

288
00:11:26,514 --> 00:11:29,331
Hey Jesus, just curious, what's
your position on marijuana?

289
00:11:29,365 --> 00:11:30,734
It was given to us by God.

290
00:11:30,768 --> 00:11:31,868
It should be legal.

291
00:11:31,902 --> 00:11:35,355
Oh, that's nice.

292
00:11:46,517 --> 00:11:48,717
Hear me, hear me!

293
00:11:51,087 --> 00:11:53,188
Presenting
the real-life fairy tale

294
00:11:53,224 --> 00:11:55,625
of how princess Annie was saved

295
00:11:55,658 --> 00:11:57,293
from bad neighborhood forest

296
00:11:57,327 --> 00:11:58,827
by woodsman Troy.

297
00:12:00,364 --> 00:12:02,865
And Bebad, his emotionally
unavailable unicorn.

298
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,335
Brought to you by

299
00:12:05,369 --> 00:12:08,071
the girl-yogurt
Jamie Lee Curtis uses to poop.

300
00:12:08,105 --> 00:12:09,739
There's
a package of it in the fridge

301
00:12:09,774 --> 00:12:11,073
as a welcoming gift.

302
00:12:11,107 --> 00:12:12,975
Now, once upon a time

303
00:12:13,009 --> 00:12:15,577
there was a beautiful
princess named Annie.

304
00:12:15,613 --> 00:12:16,846
Hi.

305
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,899
Who was harassed every day
by Count Spaghetti.

306
00:12:21,818 --> 00:12:24,102
The evil cracksmith who lived
outside of her building.

307
00:12:24,154 --> 00:12:25,687
Whoa!

308
00:12:25,722 --> 00:12:27,105
I just stand here?

309
00:12:27,158 --> 00:12:28,691
Oh, come on, Jeffrey.

310
00:12:28,725 --> 00:12:31,394
Get in here!

311
00:12:31,427 --> 00:12:32,946
This is gonna be fun!

312
00:12:32,996 --> 00:12:34,330
Or else.

313
00:12:34,365 --> 00:12:35,727
So we just punch in
the numbers?

314
00:12:35,729 --> 00:12:36,671
That's right.

315
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:39,106
Okay, you know this one, Jeff.

316
00:12:39,135 --> 00:12:42,120
We've sang it a thousand times
together in my mind.

317
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:46,292
Huh, huh?
Oh come on, Jeffrey.

318
00:12:46,342 --> 00:12:48,443
Make or break time.

319
00:12:48,479 --> 00:12:51,114
Unless you want to be
back here next Saturday.

Ah!
That was great.

338
00:14:22,306 --> 00:14:23,605
Yeah, might have been
a little fun.

339
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,674
Huh, see?

340
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,210
And you emailed your therapist

341
00:14:27,244 --> 00:14:29,177
that you wanted to be
alone this weekend.

342
00:14:30,681 --> 00:14:32,414
What?

343
00:14:32,448 --> 00:14:33,883
Hmm?

344
00:14:33,918 --> 00:14:36,536
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

345
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,153
Now, with your permission,

346
00:14:38,187 --> 00:14:40,690
I'd like to sing a little song
about race-mixing.

347
00:14:40,724 --> 00:14:43,042
<i>This one's called
"Don't You Do It."</i>

348
00:14:43,076 --> 00:14:46,796
Get out!

349
00:14:58,008 --> 00:14:59,709
Ah, good evening, senator.

350
00:14:59,743 --> 00:15:02,245
Any requests?

351
00:15:02,278 --> 00:15:05,315
What do you want to do next?
I paid for a full hour, so--

352
00:15:05,349 --> 00:15:08,116
I email my therapist
from my Greendale account.

353
00:15:08,152 --> 00:15:10,153
The same account
where I received an email

354
00:15:10,187 --> 00:15:13,523
from physique25 telling me
about today's sale.

355
00:15:13,557 --> 00:15:15,124
Is that why you're at the mall?

356
00:15:15,158 --> 00:15:16,525
You read student emails?

357
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:18,561
Oh, oh, now the patriot act

358
00:15:18,595 --> 00:15:20,495
says I can do it, Jeffrey...
Technically.

359
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:23,615
Need I remind you
the nation is at war-- Ow!

360
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:25,234
- I'll kill you.
- No, Jeffrey, no!

361
00:15:25,251 --> 00:15:26,369
Jeffrey, Jeffrey come on!

362
00:15:26,403 --> 00:15:28,638
Just remember,
we were making memories!

363
00:15:28,672 --> 00:15:30,306
<i>No, Jeffrey, no!</i>

364
00:15:30,341 --> 00:15:31,807
Aah!

365
00:15:31,841 --> 00:15:33,775
No, Jeffrey!
No, no, it's too violent!

366
00:15:33,811 --> 00:15:36,261
You're scaring me!
Don't let the terrorists win!

367
00:15:38,087 --> 00:15:43,087
And then the three of them lived
happily ever after!

368
00:15:43,975 --> 00:15:45,476
And Bebad became
the little dipper.

369
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:48,379
The end.

370
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:53,369
- Kiss me, woodsman Troy!
- Mwah!

371
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:54,919
You guys!

372
00:15:54,953 --> 00:15:57,121
Living here is gonna be
fun all the time.

373
00:15:57,155 --> 00:15:59,325
Let's make
the entire apartment a fort.

374
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:01,342
I'll get more blankets.

375
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:17,008
This is a space we reserved
for virtual adventures.

376
00:16:17,027 --> 00:16:19,177
Like a playroom but
only works in our minds.

377
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:22,313
We call it the dreamatorium.

378
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:25,250
But...it's a bedroom.

379
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,052
No, no.
There's only two bedrooms,

380
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:28,486
including the blanket fort.

381
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,239
This is the...

382
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:32,990
Dreamatorium.

383
00:16:33,024 --> 00:16:35,159
All day, I've been

384
00:16:35,193 --> 00:16:36,794
jumping through hoops
to fit in.

385
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:37,995
Including the literal hoops

386
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,414
you put in front of the toilet.

387
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:40,932
- Yes.
- And you guys are hoarding

388
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:43,969
this second bedroom
as some kind of playroom?

389
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,171
And making me sleep
on a pile of laundry?

390
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:48,440
Hey, we worked hard on that.
And it's a blanket fort.

391
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:51,943
It's an asylum
for half-witted children!

392
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:54,679
As the only adult
in this apartment,

393
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:56,581
I am making an ultimatum.

394
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:59,384
Me or this...
Stupid dreamatorium.

395
00:16:59,402 --> 00:17:01,102
Dreamatorium is non-negotiable.
Read the lease.

396
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:02,587
Especially the part
we added in crayon.

397
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:03,855
You don't wanna
take this to court.

398
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,156
Trust us, this place
can be a courtroom

399
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,724
in the blink of an eye.

400
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:09,361
This doesn't work for me.

401
00:17:09,394 --> 00:17:10,863
From the minute
I joined the study group

402
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:12,730
I've been worried
about how uptight I am

403
00:17:12,766 --> 00:17:14,566
and how I'm no fun.

404
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:16,134
And then I was worried
that I wouldn't fit in here

405
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:17,568
or be able to hang
with you guys.

406
00:17:17,586 --> 00:17:19,003
But you know what?

407
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,439
Why don't you ever ask
yourselves whether

408
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:21,940
you can hang with me?

409
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:23,541
Why am I always the one
that has to adapt?

410
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:25,309
I'm sick of this crap!

411
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:28,730
Enjoy your stupid dreamatorium.

412
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:30,347
We will!

413
00:17:30,365 --> 00:17:32,250
Because this is
our apartment too!

414
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:33,868
And just because we're awesome

415
00:17:33,903 --> 00:17:36,054
doesn't mean we're not adults!

416
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:40,425
Candy cigarette?

417
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,759
I don't want a candy cigarette.

418
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:45,363
- I want our Annie.
- Yeah, we blew it.

419
00:17:45,381 --> 00:17:48,433
I picked the wrong week
to quit.

420
00:17:52,806 --> 00:17:54,640
What the hell is this?

421
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:56,942
In security deposit terms,
it's a gold mine.

422
00:17:56,976 --> 00:17:58,876
And you're lucky it's only
gonna cost you money.

423
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:01,395
Your friend nearly
killed himself.

424
00:18:01,431 --> 00:18:03,147
Yeah, that's me.

425
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:05,750
Lucky Annie.

426
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:08,086
I'm really sorry, Annie.

427
00:18:08,121 --> 00:18:09,555
I had some island girls over

428
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,222
and one of them must have
slipped me a Mickey.

429
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,491
I'm just glad you're okay.

430
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:16,094
You can pay me back
by helping me

431
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:18,063
get all my stuff
from Troy and Abed's.

432
00:18:18,096 --> 00:18:22,099
You're moving again?
How long was I out?

433
00:18:22,117 --> 00:18:23,769
Is napster still a thing?

434
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:26,605
You've been out long enough
for me to realize

435
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:29,607
that I'm gonna need
to keep living alone.

436
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,210
Come on.

437
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:33,662
Let's get you cleaned up.

438
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:35,180
Oh, what the hell?

439
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:37,281
I have brain damage.
Nothing I do counts.

440
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,722
Where is all my stuff?

441
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:46,758
Troy, Abed?

442
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:55,183
It's all yours.

443
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:56,768
We're sorry.

444
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,604
Sometimes we get stuck
in our own little world.

445
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,873
And then in that world,
we make even littler worlds.

446
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:03,241
And sometimes there are
tunnels between those worlds.

447
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:05,510
Or a subway.
One time a snake.

448
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:07,578
We're sorry.
Do you like it?

449
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:11,750
Of course, I do.
It's perfect.

450
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:13,167
I mean, I can rearrange
the throw pillows.

451
00:19:13,202 --> 00:19:14,819
You have them arranged
by size instead of color, but--

452
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:16,521
What did I say?

453
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:17,990
But what about
the dreamatorium?

454
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:19,290
Oh, it's staying.

455
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:20,592
The dreamatorium is more
important than any of us.

456
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:21,894
But you're more important
than our bedroom,

457
00:19:21,928 --> 00:19:23,295
so we put the bunk bed
in the blanket fort.

458
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:24,762
This is all gay code.

459
00:19:24,797 --> 00:19:26,664
You sure I'm worth it?

460
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:27,865
Yeah, there's a couple of
things that we were hoping

461
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:29,300
that you'd help us with.

462
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:30,536
Yes, like where does
the water go in the iron?

463
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:31,603
And what's the iron for?

464
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:32,938
And what
gets out kool-aid stains?

465
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:34,239
Yeah, we already know
that the opposite

466
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:35,773
color kool-aid
doesn't work.

467
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,277
Also, Troy scraped me when
we were fork-jousting last week

468
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,394
and I don't think
it's healing right.

469
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:40,711
- Oh, Abed, that's infected.
- Ew!

470
00:19:40,747 --> 00:19:42,447
Infected. That's the word
I was looking for.

471
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:45,284
- Hi, guys.
- I thought you were sick.

472
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:47,486
I was...n't.

473
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,054
I kind of made it up
to get out of helping.

474
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:50,521
Oh, that's okay.

475
00:19:50,557 --> 00:19:52,624
- It is?
- Yeah, it is.

476
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:55,394
Oh, hey, Jeff, did you
know that when it snows

477
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:56,827
my eyes become large?

478
00:19:56,863 --> 00:20:00,499
♪ and the light that
you shine can be seen ♪

479
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,000
He tweeted it?

480
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:05,537
- ♪ baby ♪
- He tweeted it!

481
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:09,207
♪ A kiss from a Rose
on the grave ♪

482
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:13,060

484
00:20:26,911 --> 00:20:28,679
- Oh, look out, asteroids!
- That was close.

485
00:20:28,712 --> 00:20:29,980
Thanks for getting us
to planet Greendalia

486
00:20:30,013 --> 00:20:31,597
safely, horsebot 3000.

487
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:33,066
- Well--
- Oh, no!

488
00:20:33,101 --> 00:20:35,919
Greendalia has been overrun
by evil King Blorgon!

489
00:20:35,952 --> 00:20:38,154
- Look out, Troyborg!
- Pew pew pew!

490
00:20:38,189 --> 00:20:39,556
Ah! I'm dead.

491
00:20:39,574 --> 00:20:41,825
Horsebot 3000, no!
I love you!

492
00:20:41,858 --> 00:20:43,393
I am King Blorgon.

493
00:20:43,427 --> 00:20:45,662
And my plan is
to blow up the world!

494
00:20:45,697 --> 00:20:48,432
Your lasers are
useless against me.

495
00:20:48,465 --> 00:20:50,000
Aim for his butt.
It's his only weakness.

496
00:20:50,034 --> 00:20:51,000
- Pew pew!
- Bam bam!

497
00:20:51,035 --> 00:20:52,669
- Aah!
- We did it!

498
00:20:52,703 --> 00:20:55,788
Peace and tranquility have
been restored to Greendalia.

499
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:57,406
And all thanks
to horsebot 3000.

500
00:20:57,442 --> 00:20:59,092
He belongs to the stars now.

501
00:21:00,711 --> 00:21:01,912
All right, five more minutes

502
00:21:01,945 --> 00:21:04,614
and we should probably
put a stop to this, right?

503
00:21:04,648 --> 00:21:06,782
Jeff, are you--

504
00:21:06,817 --> 00:21:08,818
I liked horsebot 3000.
