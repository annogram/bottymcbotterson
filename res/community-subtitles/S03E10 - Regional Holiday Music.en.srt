1
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:07,326
Wow. They found a way to make
the human being even creepier.

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,694
Covering him in icicles.

3
00:00:08,712 --> 00:00:10,129
I think it's festive.

4
00:00:10,163 --> 00:00:11,714
Yeah, my favorite
Christmas tradition

5
00:00:11,748 --> 00:00:13,332
is trimming the hellraiser.

6
00:00:13,366 --> 00:00:15,184
Guys, I found something
we can watch together

7
00:00:15,218 --> 00:00:16,752
for Christmas this year.

8
00:00:16,803 --> 00:00:20,272
The long-lost 1981 <i>Inspector
Spacetime Holiday Special</i>.</i>

9
00:00:20,307 --> 00:00:22,608
Run time two and half hours
and so critically reviled

10
00:00:22,642 --> 00:00:25,127
that after it aired, the creator
has his knighthood revoked.

11
00:00:25,161 --> 00:00:26,612
That sounds terrible.

12
00:00:26,646 --> 00:00:28,247
I want to watch it twice,

13
00:00:28,281 --> 00:00:30,249
but I'm spending Christmas
with my relatives.

14
00:00:30,283 --> 00:00:33,118
Or rather, I'm spending
the day with my relatives

15
00:00:33,153 --> 00:00:34,770
while they refuse
to acknowledge Christmas.

16
00:00:34,821 --> 00:00:37,556
You Jehovah's Witnesses--
so severe.

17
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,558
Andre and I will be spending
Christmas giving gifts

18
00:00:39,592 --> 00:00:41,493
to the more persuadable
of our Jewish friends.

19
00:00:41,528 --> 00:00:43,946
I wouldn't call an unannounced
visit from your pastor "a gift."

20
00:00:43,997 --> 00:00:45,397
And don't bother this year.

21
00:00:45,415 --> 00:00:46,949
I'll be at the movies
with my bubbe.

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,468
You're not taking both of them?

23
00:00:49,502 --> 00:00:51,470
Well, one's dead.

24
00:00:51,504 --> 00:00:52,788
- What?
- I was looking forward

25
00:00:52,839 --> 00:00:54,590
to hanging out with you guys
this Christmas.

26
00:00:54,624 --> 00:00:56,709
This semester has been so long
and dark and angry.

27
00:00:56,743 --> 00:00:57,743
I was thinking we could have

28
00:00:57,777 --> 00:00:59,044
some light-hearted fun
as a family.

29
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:00,212
I think what we've learned,
Abed,

30
00:01:00,246 --> 00:01:02,514
is that attempts to make
the holidays brighter

31
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:04,183
tend to give them
a certain darkness.

32
00:01:04,217 --> 00:01:05,718
Oh, I don't know
if I agree with that.

41
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:24,620
What the hell
are "regionals?"

42
00:01:24,654 --> 00:01:26,372

Nobody hates Glee Club
more than you.

54
00:01:45,325 --> 00:01:47,643
Today I'm just content
to sit back and enjoy the show.

55
00:01:47,677 --> 00:01:49,628

64
00:02:05,445 --> 00:02:06,745
It appears they have received
an anonymous tip

65
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,031
that unlicensed material
was being performed here

The Glee Club
is at Westside Hospital,

82
00:03:03,803 --> 00:03:07,105
recuperating from
a collective nervous breakdown.

83
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,676
This is the second glee club
we've lost in two years.

84
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:13,211
We might have to cancel
the Christmas pageant.

85
00:03:13,229 --> 00:03:16,064
And to think they were
this close to regionals.

86
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:17,115
What the hell are regionals?

87
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,568
They're this close, Pierce.

88
00:03:19,602 --> 00:03:22,554
Anyway, an old friend
wants to talk to you.

89
00:03:22,572 --> 00:03:24,790
Your favorite
glee club instructor,

90
00:03:24,824 --> 00:03:28,777
the dreamy and boyish
Mr. Cory Radison!

91
00:03:28,828 --> 00:03:30,662
Oh!

92
00:03:30,697 --> 00:03:33,282
Uh, I thought I told you
to call me Mr. Rad.

93
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:34,466
Or Cory.

94
00:03:34,501 --> 00:03:35,918
Just don't call me
"late to dinner."

95
00:03:35,952 --> 00:03:37,452
Unless you're serving
brussels sprouts!

96
00:03:37,504 --> 00:03:40,589
I won't, I promise!

97
00:03:40,623 --> 00:03:43,041
This guy's like human froyo.

98
00:03:43,076 --> 00:03:45,878
Look, when the last glee club
died in that bus crash,

99
00:03:45,912 --> 00:03:47,246
you guys stepped up.

100
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,765
And you were the best gosh darn
emergency substitutes

101
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:50,766
I've ever worked with.

102
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,301
- Aw!
- Well, this time...

103
00:03:52,352 --> 00:03:55,304
I'm not gonna kid you.
I won't be easy.

104
00:03:55,355 --> 00:03:56,655
- Oh!
- Your best...

105
00:03:56,689 --> 00:03:58,490
Won't be good enough.

106
00:03:58,525 --> 00:04:00,959
And ten times your best
will be so bad,

107
00:04:00,994 --> 00:04:03,028
I will yell at you.

108
00:04:03,062 --> 00:04:05,864
But I promise,
if we dig down--

109
00:04:05,899 --> 00:04:07,866
- Pass.
- Yeah.

110
00:04:07,901 --> 00:04:11,203
Okay.

111
00:04:11,237 --> 00:04:13,505
Whew.

112
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,508
Don't you hurt him.

113
00:04:16,543 --> 00:04:17,876
Mr. Rad!

114
00:04:17,911 --> 00:04:19,995
I feel like we let
Mr. Rad down.

115
00:04:20,046 --> 00:04:22,014
No, he let himself down
when he left the house

116
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:23,582
this morning
wearing a sweater-vest.

117
00:04:23,616 --> 00:04:25,334
I guess we did have fun
last time.

118
00:04:25,385 --> 00:04:27,219
Did we?
I can hardly remember.

119
00:04:27,253 --> 00:04:29,137
It's all a weird, happy,
musical fog.

120
00:04:29,172 --> 00:04:31,023
Yeah, it was almost
like being on ecstasy,

121
00:04:31,057 --> 00:04:33,091
only instead of having
pointless conversations

122
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:35,177
and dancing like idiots--
wait.

123
00:04:35,228 --> 00:04:37,679
It was exactly
like being on ecstasy!

124
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:38,864
That's what worries me
about this guy.

125
00:04:38,898 --> 00:04:41,183
He is equal parts hanson
and manson.

126
00:04:41,234 --> 00:04:44,169
Nobody let him corner you until
he is out of recruitment mode,

127
00:04:44,203 --> 00:04:45,604
or next thing you know,

128
00:04:45,638 --> 00:04:48,340
we'll all be caring
about Christmas pageants and...

129
00:04:48,374 --> 00:04:49,324
Regionals.

130
00:04:49,359 --> 00:04:50,359
- You're right, deal.
- Ugh.

131
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:51,360
- Agreed.
- Got you.

132
00:04:51,411 --> 00:04:53,078
What the hell are regionals?

133
00:05:02,538 --> 00:05:03,922
What are you still doing here?

134
00:05:03,957 --> 00:05:05,791
I thought I'd give her
one more tinkle

135
00:05:05,825 --> 00:05:07,960
before I took down decorations.

136
00:05:07,994 --> 00:05:10,662
No glee club means no pageant,
means no Christmas.

137
00:05:10,697 --> 00:05:12,030
I'm sure trying
to make things brighter

138
00:05:12,065 --> 00:05:13,966
just would've made
more darkness.

139
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,402
That sounds like
a certain ex-lawyer talking.

140
00:05:17,437 --> 00:05:19,771
I see a lot of myself in you,
Abed.

141
00:05:19,806 --> 00:05:21,673
You care about your friends,
and you wish they cared

142
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,108
more about each other.

143
00:05:23,142 --> 00:05:25,394
That's not an easy position
to be in sometimes.

144
00:05:25,445 --> 00:05:26,478
I just want my friends and I

145
00:05:26,512 --> 00:05:27,679
to have
a merry Christmas together.

146
00:05:27,714 --> 00:05:29,214
Well, maybe you could start

147
00:05:29,248 --> 00:05:31,950
by giving them the greatest
Christmas gift of all.

148
00:05:31,985 --> 00:05:33,385

00:06:29,475 --> 00:06:31,009
Thank you, Mr. Rad.

175
00:06:31,044 --> 00:06:32,477
Don't break down the set yet.

176
00:06:32,512 --> 00:06:36,298
I'm gonna try to get my friends
to be in the Christmas pageant.

177
00:06:36,349 --> 00:06:40,619
Thank you, Abed!

178
00:06:40,653 --> 00:06:42,154
Thank you.

179
00:06:52,026 --> 00:06:53,076
Merry Christmas, Troy.

180
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,828
Abed, you look gleeful.

181
00:06:54,862 --> 00:06:56,496
Troy, don't you think
it might actually be fun,

182
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:58,031
doing this Christmas pageant
for the glee club?

183
00:06:58,065 --> 00:07:00,300
Abed, we hate the glee club.

184
00:07:00,334 --> 00:07:01,735
Yeah.

185
00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:03,136
I guess I just like
liking things.

186
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:06,039
Abed.

187
00:07:06,073 --> 00:07:09,626
Look, you know I'd do anything
you did, but...

188
00:07:09,677 --> 00:07:11,177
I'm a Jehovah's Witness.

189
00:07:11,212 --> 00:07:12,679
We're not supposed
to celebrate Christmas.

190
00:07:12,713 --> 00:07:14,948
I've been thinking about that.

191
00:07:14,982 --> 00:07:16,800
I may have a loophole.

192
00:07:16,851 --> 00:07:18,351
What if you were
a Jehovah's Witness

193
00:07:18,385 --> 00:07:20,804
that was merely pretending
to be into Christmas,

194
00:07:20,855 --> 00:07:22,222
gathering clues and blending in

195
00:07:22,256 --> 00:07:23,923
to take down the holidays
from within?

196
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:26,259
You mean like a spy
investigating,

197
00:07:26,293 --> 00:07:27,861
making it seem
like I'm celebrating,

198
00:07:27,895 --> 00:07:31,197
when actually I'm infiltrating
Santa's operation?

00:08:24,952 --> 00:08:26,819
Hey, guys.

230
00:08:26,837 --> 00:08:28,054
Rapping?

231
00:08:28,088 --> 00:08:31,391
- Yep, wanna join us?
- Totally!

232
00:08:31,425 --> 00:08:33,993
Wait, you guys never
let me rap with you.

233
00:08:34,028 --> 00:08:35,128
Well, we're gonna need
all hands on deck

234
00:08:35,162 --> 00:08:38,131
if we're gonna go to regionals.

235
00:08:38,165 --> 00:08:39,632
Cool.

236
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:41,568
I just need to...
Study...

237
00:08:41,602 --> 00:08:43,369
Though...In my room.

238
00:08:43,404 --> 00:08:44,804
So have fun!

239
00:08:44,838 --> 00:08:46,472
And then, this morning,

240
00:08:46,506 --> 00:08:47,640
I could hear them
in the bathroom,

241
00:08:47,674 --> 00:08:49,742
doing
country Western mash-ups.

242
00:08:49,777 --> 00:08:51,544
And they won't stop talking
about regionals!

243
00:08:51,579 --> 00:08:52,812
Maybe it's nothing.

244
00:08:52,846 --> 00:08:54,147
Yeah, if "nothing"
wears a sweater-vest

245
00:08:54,181 --> 00:08:55,698
and seems aggressively asexual.

246
00:08:55,733 --> 00:08:58,351
Come on, let's all study
for our biology final

247
00:08:58,385 --> 00:09:00,069
in our old--

248
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,088
Where's our table?

249
00:09:02,122 --> 00:09:04,891
Who's that guy?

250
00:09:04,925 --> 00:09:06,793
You guys all see him too,
right?

251
00:09:06,827 --> 00:09:08,378
- Hey, guys.
- Merry Christmas, y'all.

252
00:09:08,429 --> 00:09:10,046
Sorry about the rearrangement.

253
00:09:10,097 --> 00:09:11,798
We need this space to rehearse
for the pageant.

254
00:09:11,832 --> 00:09:13,666
But we're not doing
the pageant.

255
00:09:13,684 --> 00:09:15,435
Look, guys,
I hear your negativity,

256
00:09:15,469 --> 00:09:17,203
but also,
can I counter with this?

257
00:09:17,238 --> 00:09:19,005
Who hates glee?

258
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,807
Listen to how that sounds.

259
00:09:20,841 --> 00:09:23,176
Glee literally
means "glee."

260
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:24,477
Oh, stop it!

261
00:09:24,511 --> 00:09:26,396
Not liking glee club
doesn't make us bullies,

262
00:09:26,447 --> 00:09:28,548
and implying that
is reverse bullying.

263
00:09:28,582 --> 00:09:29,916
Good point.
Sing about it?

264
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:30,917
No!

265
00:09:30,951 --> 00:09:33,253
I understand them,
but you, Pierce?

266
00:09:33,287 --> 00:09:34,754
Your generation invented music!

267
00:09:34,788 --> 00:09:37,624
I don't know
about "invented."

268
00:09:37,658 --> 00:09:39,692
- Perfected, maybe.
- Pierce!

269
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,561
They're just trying to pander
to your demographics'

270
00:09:41,595 --> 00:09:43,796
well-documented
historical vanity. Resist!

271
00:09:43,831 --> 00:09:45,632
Abed,
wasn't Santa Claus himself

272
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:46,966
part of Pierce's peer group?

273
00:09:47,001 --> 00:09:49,002
I believe so.

274
00:09:49,036 --> 00:09:51,037

I'm hoping

we can get Shirley or Annie.

So Shirley or Annie

There's a leaf

00:11:43,917 --> 00:11:46,619
Mr. Radison, who authorized
you to rearrange our study room,

318
00:11:46,653 --> 00:11:48,087
and who do you think
you are anyway?

319
00:11:48,122 --> 00:11:51,157
I'll tell you.

I'm scared to go
into the study room.

324
00:12:00,034 --> 00:12:01,634
There are so many top hats
in there.

325
00:12:01,668 --> 00:12:03,403
I wish there was a way
we could stop all this.

326
00:12:03,437 --> 00:12:05,805
I mean, I realize the stakes
aren't actually that high,

327
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,707
but somehow, that just
makes it extra scary.

328
00:12:07,741 --> 00:12:08,891
I know.

329
00:12:08,942 --> 00:12:11,527
Jeff, I think I know
what Mr. Rad is up to.

330
00:12:11,562 --> 00:12:15,064
There's something
you have to see.

331
00:12:15,115 --> 00:12:17,483
Mr. Rad plans to get
every single member

332
00:12:17,518 --> 00:12:19,285
of our study group
to join the glee club.

333
00:12:19,319 --> 00:12:21,354
Well, I don't know how
he thinks that's gonna happen.

334
00:12:21,388 --> 00:12:23,740
I'll show you.

335
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:25,091
Wha--?

336
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:27,360
This is just one
of the many costume changes

337
00:12:27,394 --> 00:12:29,028
I'll be doing during the show.

338
00:12:29,063 --> 00:12:31,964
We're a shoo-in for regionals,
right?

339
00:12:31,999 --> 00:12:33,066
Annie, you too?

340
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,050
This is beneath you.

341
00:12:34,084 --> 00:12:35,868
You are an intelligent woman.

00:12:35,886 --> 00:12:37,670
Also, you're Jewish!

343
00:12:37,704 --> 00:12:39,205

I have a lot to learn

And it's all thanks to you,
Mr. Rad.

408
00:15:50,542 --> 00:15:53,221
I just hope we can repay you
by making regionals.

409
00:15:53,502 --> 00:15:55,482
Uh, I thought
this was regionals.

410
00:15:56,092 --> 00:15:58,715
Don't let my confusion
undercut their importance.

411

Scooch, scooch, scooch,
scooch, scooch.

413
00:16:04,622 --> 00:16:05,806
I could not have done this

414
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,123
without your
recruiting skills, Abed.

415
00:16:07,141 --> 00:16:08,792
I was happy to do it.
For a while there, I thought

416
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:11,294
we were gonna end the semester
on a really dark note.

417
00:16:11,312 --> 00:16:12,729
I'm glad we're singing
and dancing together instead.

418
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:14,064
This has been a good time.

419
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,066
And it's going to continue
to be a good time.

420
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,735
If we win regionals, then it's
straight on to sectionals.

421
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,238
And then a week later is semis.
Then semiregionals.

422
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:23,073
Then regional-semis.

423
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:25,542
Then national
lower-zone semis!

Mr. Radison,
I think it's fine.

00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:02,289
I know Greendale
is an all-inclusive school.

464
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,459
Why don't we let Britta
sing her awkward song?

465
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:07,744
Yeah!

466

No, no, no, no, no, no!

467

Well, figuratively.

471
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,861

00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:28,098
"I killed

473

I'm saying
you not listening to me

474
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:35,572
is like metaphorically cutting
the brake lines on your own--

475
00:18:35,606 --> 00:18:38,542
Look, kings of Leon!

476
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,977
What did he say?

477
00:18:41,012 --> 00:18:43,313
Did Mr. Rad
kill the last glee club?

478
00:18:43,348 --> 00:18:45,182
And to think
I trusted him enough

479
00:18:45,216 --> 00:18:48,318
to captain a magic carpet
in that dream I had last night.

480
00:18:48,353 --> 00:18:50,554
Maybe Jeff's right.

481
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:51,922
Maybe forcing things
to be bright just makes

482
00:18:51,956 --> 00:18:53,323
the darkness underneath
even darker.

483
00:18:53,358 --> 00:18:56,193
This was all my fault for
insisting we do the pageant.

484
00:18:56,227 --> 00:18:58,195
Sorry.

485
00:18:58,229 --> 00:19:00,530
Merry Christmas.

486
00:19:00,565 --> 00:19:04,701
I guess I'll just see you guys
after the holidays.

487
00:19:10,808 --> 00:19:12,642
Happy time day, Reggie.

488
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,078
It is tradition to give
one's constable a gift

489
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:16,363
at the end
of each orbital cycle.

490
00:19:16,414 --> 00:19:18,048
Oh, thank you, inspector!

491
00:19:20,084 --> 00:19:22,319
- Blimey! A hologram?
- Mm-hmm.

492
00:19:22,353 --> 00:19:23,987
Let's activate it

00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,228
It's been a dark semester.

506
00:20:05,263 --> 00:20:06,730
I basically killed a guy.

507
00:20:06,764 --> 00:20:09,532
And I kind of attacked you guys
with a fire axe.

508
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,767
Yeah.

509
00:20:10,802 --> 00:20:12,002
I'm thinking about seeing
a new shrink.

510
00:20:12,036 --> 00:20:13,003
- What?
- Don't.

511
00:20:13,037 --> 00:20:14,204
Holy crap.
