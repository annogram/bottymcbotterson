1
00:00:05,676 --> 00:00:07,213
Hey, Buzzby, how are you today?

2
00:00:07,214 --> 00:00:08,708
Not so great, Bumbleton.

3
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:10,243
I have a ton of pollen to collect,

4
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:11,699
but I'm really tired.

5
00:00:11,701 --> 00:00:14,259
Flying a little low?
Maybe you should get high.

6
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,948
- Who's this?
- This is Drugs.

7
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:18,748
- Aren't drugs bad?
- No way.

8
00:00:18,748 --> 00:00:21,477
Drugs are like special honey.
They give you a buzzzzz.

9
00:00:21,478 --> 00:00:23,309
Don't call me honey, honey.

10
00:00:23,309 --> 00:00:24,367
Pierce!

11
00:00:24,795 --> 00:00:25,884
Drugs doesn't say that.

12
00:00:25,885 --> 00:00:28,123
I don't say anything,
by the way.

13
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:30,625
I mean, I thought this show
was about drug awareness.

14
00:00:30,626 --> 00:00:33,070
Who's gonna be aware of a
character that has no lines?

15
00:00:33,195 --> 00:00:36,273
And also I noticed on page 15
I get flushed down the toilet.

16
00:00:36,274 --> 00:00:37,948
Consider yourself lucky.

17
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,322
Annie, question.
Is Pierce marijuana?

18
00:00:40,323 --> 00:00:42,048
And does marijuana help
people work faster?

19
00:00:42,048 --> 00:00:43,445
I thought it made them just
custom-paint their vans

20
00:00:43,445 --> 00:00:44,286
and solve mysteries.

21
00:00:44,286 --> 00:00:46,741
Also, are you sure that
my costume is on backwards?

22
00:00:46,743 --> 00:00:48,860
Somehow I felt more
confident before.

23
00:00:48,862 --> 00:00:50,941
I have a question.
I don't think my character

24
00:00:50,942 --> 00:00:52,270
would say "tripping balls."

25
00:00:52,271 --> 00:00:53,112
That's not a question.

26
00:00:53,112 --> 00:00:54,079
I don't think my character

27
00:00:54,081 --> 00:00:56,079
would say tripping balls, okay?

28
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,625
Guys, let's remember
why we're doing this.

29
00:00:58,627 --> 00:01:00,933
If our work helps even one
kid make better choices,

30
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,737
then it will all be worth it.

31
00:01:02,767 --> 00:01:05,048
I wish I had seen a show
like this when I was younger.

32
00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:06,828
It might have helped
me avoid my mistakes.

33
00:01:06,828 --> 00:01:08,629
Well, we're happy to
do this for you, Annie,

34
00:01:08,631 --> 00:01:11,067
but I have to say, my school
had plenty of shows like this,

35
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:13,686
and I think sitting through
them drove me to drugs.

36
00:01:13,688 --> 00:01:14,593
You don't count, Britta.

37
00:01:14,594 --> 00:01:16,162
You don't respond to
anything appropriately.

38
00:01:16,164 --> 00:01:17,567
Thank you!

39
00:01:18,162 --> 00:01:19,984
Dean-dong!

40
00:01:21,131 --> 00:01:22,492
I'm just checking in to see

41
00:01:22,493 --> 00:01:25,111
how the Greendale antidrug
players are doing.

42
00:01:27,823 --> 00:01:29,980
and there's gonna be at least 50

43
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,209
little at-risk rug rats
coming here tomorrow

44
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:33,346
for your big world premiere.

45
00:01:33,347 --> 00:01:35,098
That is terrific.

46
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:36,323
So with any luck,
we can get rid of

47
00:01:36,323 --> 00:01:38,990
all those Charleston Chews
in the vending machines.

48
00:01:39,593 --> 00:01:42,852
Um, dean Pelton,
were you hoping to participate

49
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:45,139
- in the show?
- Oh, I would love to, Annie.

50
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,472
But as you can see from my outfit,

51
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:50,162
I already have plans,
so off to the airport Ramada!

52
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:54,402
How come he gets
a front stinger?

53

55
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,417
Do you think bees
eat their own honey?

56
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,032
I'm sure they've
at least tasted it.

57
00:02:27,033 --> 00:02:29,795
- This guy keeps texting me.
- You don't like him?

58
00:02:29,796 --> 00:02:31,860
I don't like flirting in text.

59
00:02:31,865 --> 00:02:34,319
That's like saying you
don't work by electric light.

60
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,997
If you want to have
an active sex life,

61
00:02:35,998 --> 00:02:36,810
part of it is texting.

62
00:02:36,811 --> 00:02:39,043
Hmm. I don't remember
asking your opinion.

63
00:02:39,045 --> 00:02:40,252
Can't talk now.

64
00:02:40,253 --> 00:02:44,009
Shirley, since I might be the
father of your unborn child,

65
00:02:44,062 --> 00:02:45,914
I made you a mix tape.

66
00:02:45,991 --> 00:02:47,731
I hope you like Johnny Gill.

67
00:02:47,957 --> 00:02:50,805
And since you probably don't
have a cassette player,

68
00:02:50,854 --> 00:02:53,622
here's a list of used
ones on Craigslist.

69
00:02:53,623 --> 00:02:55,252
Britta, are you walking
out of this room?

70
00:02:55,253 --> 00:02:56,932
Uh... yeah.

71
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:00,425
Hey... you know that you're gonna

72
00:03:00,426 --> 00:03:01,745
have to acknowledge
him eventually.

73
00:03:01,746 --> 00:03:02,816
I don't know who
you're talking about.

74
00:03:02,817 --> 00:03:05,493
- Chang. - I know who you're talking
about... He doesn't exist!

75
00:03:08,335 --> 00:03:09,689
- Um, Annie?
- Ooh!

76
00:03:09,884 --> 00:03:11,537
- I'm sorry. A word?
- Mm-hmm!

77
00:03:11,552 --> 00:03:12,185
I don't know if you know this,

78
00:03:12,186 --> 00:03:15,778
but I did TV commercials
for Hawthorne Wipes...

79
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,548
family business... in the fifties.

80
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:18,396
Oh!

81
00:03:18,396 --> 00:03:21,603
I was kind of the Gerber
Baby of moist towelettes.

82
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,296
- That's great, Pierce.
- Yeah, yeah.

83
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,164
Oh, I've done a lot of acting.

84
00:03:25,165 --> 00:03:26,451
- Workshops.
- Mm!

85
00:03:26,453 --> 00:03:29,463
I do physical comedy.
Funny dances.

86
00:03:29,836 --> 00:03:31,891
- Foreign accents.
- Accents?

87
00:03:31,893 --> 00:03:33,284
Name any country.

88
00:03:33,469 --> 00:03:34,528
Russia.

89
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:35,389
Point being,

90
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,132
there are many tools I
can bring to the table

91
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:39,199
that I think the
script may be wasting.

92
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,243
Pierce, you know what I think

93
00:03:40,245 --> 00:03:42,159
is really great about this show?

94
00:03:42,509 --> 00:03:45,538
The only real star
of it is the message.

95
00:03:45,748 --> 00:03:47,831
Right. Uh... is the
message Jeff Winger?

96
00:03:47,831 --> 00:03:49,966
Because he's on every
page of this thing.

97
00:03:49,966 --> 00:03:51,626
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Uh...

98
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:52,602
You bet.

99
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,493
Oh, Britta left her phone.

100
00:03:57,495 --> 00:03:59,359
- She's getting a text message.
- Let me see.

101
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:02,127
- Oh. It's from Marcus.
- Mm.

102
00:04:02,127 --> 00:04:03,931
"I'll be at the
show tomorrow night.

103
00:04:03,931 --> 00:04:05,700
"Can't wait to see you.

104
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:08,942
Are you really wearing
a cat costume?"

105
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,310
- Mm.
- Well, Marcus...

106
00:04:10,396 --> 00:04:12,594
You are in luck.

107
00:04:12,596 --> 00:04:13,320
What are you doing?

108
00:04:13,322 --> 00:04:16,533
Dragging Britta kicking
and screaming into 1997.

109
00:04:16,533 --> 00:04:17,810
- What did you say?
- "There's not much

110
00:04:17,812 --> 00:04:19,002
"to the cat costume,

111
00:04:19,004 --> 00:04:21,872
but can't wait to show
you what's underneath."

112
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:25,283
How could you think
that was a good idea?

113
00:04:25,283 --> 00:04:26,540
- I got a better question.
- Mm-hmm.

114
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,432
How could it not
be a great idea?

115
00:05:10,988 --> 00:05:11,968
What...

116
00:05:14,244 --> 00:05:16,798
Pierce... what are you doing here?

117
00:05:16,798 --> 00:05:18,115
Never mind that.

118
00:05:18,374 --> 00:05:20,052
There's a rapist in the hallway.

119
00:05:20,052 --> 00:05:21,117
That's my landlord.

120
00:05:21,117 --> 00:05:23,327
And if he wanted to rape you,
you'd be raped.

121
00:05:23,329 --> 00:05:24,661
Did you follow me?

122
00:05:24,663 --> 00:05:26,971
Let me answer your
question with two of my own.

123
00:05:26,973 --> 00:05:29,985
What are you doing in an
apartment above Dildopolis?

124
00:05:30,156 --> 00:05:32,360
And when did they open
a second location?

125
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:33,740
This is where I live, Pierce.

126
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,447
It just happens to be
above a marital aid store.

127
00:05:36,447 --> 00:05:39,507
I don't get it.
Aren't everyone's parents rich?

128
00:05:39,558 --> 00:05:41,297
Well, I'm not
speaking to my parents.

129
00:05:41,298 --> 00:05:42,702
After my nervous breakdown,

130
00:05:42,704 --> 00:05:44,310
my mom wanted to put
the problem behind us,

131
00:05:44,312 --> 00:05:46,610
and I wanted to deal with it,
so I went to rehab,

132
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:48,088
and she cut me off.

133
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,113
What are you living on?

134
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:51,459
I saved. Every penny
from babysitting,

135
00:05:51,459 --> 00:05:52,800
every birthday check,

136
00:05:52,802 --> 00:05:55,254
every dollar from the Period
Fairy when I was a kid.

137
00:05:55,338 --> 00:05:57,194
I guess I thought it
would last longer.

138
00:05:57,196 --> 00:05:59,201
Excuse me.
What's a Period Fairy?

139
00:05:59,596 --> 00:06:01,187
The fairy that
gives you a dollar

140
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:02,858
every time you get your period.

141
00:06:03,067 --> 00:06:03,939
Does she still come?

142
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:05,336
- Pierce!
- You know,

143
00:06:05,338 --> 00:06:07,783
you and I are very
much alike, Annie.

144
00:06:07,978 --> 00:06:10,314
We're both realists.
We're both cute.

145
00:06:10,658 --> 00:06:14,261
And we'd both rather die than
let someone else control us.

146
00:06:14,528 --> 00:06:16,536
I see the point of this place now.

147
00:06:17,552 --> 00:06:19,360
This crap hole is a monument

148
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,893
to self-reliance.

149
00:06:22,264 --> 00:06:23,403
I found the drapes
in a dumpster.

150
00:06:23,403 --> 00:06:24,615
Can you believe it?

151
00:06:25,201 --> 00:06:26,173
Yes.

152
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:27,528
You know, I wanna help, Annie.

153
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:29,790
Oh, no. No, no, no,
no, no, Pierce.

154
00:06:29,792 --> 00:06:32,622
- Come on, now.
- I'm not taking money from you.

155
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,165
It's not mine. It's yours.

156
00:06:35,165 --> 00:06:37,725
You've earned it for being strong.

157
00:06:37,776 --> 00:06:41,677
It's going to drop into your
hands from out of nowhere.

158
00:06:42,523 --> 00:06:44,149
Because I was never here.

159
00:06:46,932 --> 00:06:48,369
Okay. I'm only taking this

160
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:49,985
because I'm a little
worried about making rent,

161
00:06:49,985 --> 00:06:51,384
and they told me the
procedure for selling eggs

162
00:06:51,384 --> 00:06:52,286
takes three weeks.

163
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:54,034
You save your eggs
for a rainy day.

164
00:06:54,036 --> 00:06:55,346
I'll see you tomorrow.

165
00:06:56,252 --> 00:06:57,305
Pierce?

166
00:07:05,428 --> 00:07:07,959
Hey, why did you
follow me here today?

167
00:07:08,216 --> 00:07:10,581
Oh! It was nothing, it...

168
00:07:10,581 --> 00:07:12,689
Seems sort of pointless now.

169
00:07:13,293 --> 00:07:14,939
I guess just to
talk about the play

170
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:18,012
and...Who cares if I
don't have any lines?

171
00:07:18,012 --> 00:07:19,437
Well, you know what, Pierce?

172
00:07:19,437 --> 00:07:20,963
You should do that
line you improvised.

173
00:07:20,964 --> 00:07:23,165
- "Don't call me honey, honey"?
- Yeah, that's it.

174
00:07:23,165 --> 00:07:24,172
You should do that.

175
00:07:24,365 --> 00:07:27,057
You were the Gerber Baby
of moist towelettes, right?

176
00:07:27,675 --> 00:07:29,449
Yes. Yes, I was.

177
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,545
Action!

178
00:07:31,545 --> 00:07:34,939
Hello. I'm Cornelius Hawthorne.

179
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,185
One rainy day, my son Pierce and I

180
00:07:38,185 --> 00:07:40,218
were taking a stroll
when I discovered

181
00:07:40,218 --> 00:07:44,348
the cleansing power of moist cotton,
fresh from the field.

182
00:07:44,348 --> 00:07:45,882
Isn't that right, son?

183
00:07:46,086 --> 00:07:47,779
It sure is.

184
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:49,646
It sure is, dad!

185
00:07:49,648 --> 00:07:51,836
Pierce, knock it off.

186
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,088
I wanna be in the
commercial too, father.

187
00:07:55,088 --> 00:07:56,716
Well, then you
should have done better

188
00:07:56,716 --> 00:07:58,266
in your damn audition.

189
00:07:59,095 --> 00:08:00,288
What's your name, son?

190
00:08:00,524 --> 00:08:01,706
Nigel.

191
00:08:01,964 --> 00:08:03,932
You're a good boy, Nigel.

192
00:08:03,932 --> 00:08:06,016
Your father is a lucky man.

193
00:08:13,084 --> 00:08:14,055
Okay, guys, remember,

194
00:08:14,057 --> 00:08:16,207
the most important
thing is to have fun!

195
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:17,158
And the second most
important thing

196
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,403
is to know all your lines
and all your blocking

197
00:08:18,403 --> 00:08:21,175
and not mess up a single thing.
Actually... flip those.

198
00:08:21,713 --> 00:08:24,235
Here we go, guys.
I took the liberty

199
00:08:24,235 --> 00:08:26,098
of juicing up some of our bits.

200
00:08:26,098 --> 00:08:27,093
Um...But...

201
00:08:27,095 --> 00:08:29,682
Pierce, you can't just
revise Annie's script.

202
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:31,915
And who uses wite-out anymore?

203
00:08:32,024 --> 00:08:33,609
Why don't we look
over Pierce's changes

204
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,283
and see if they improve things?

205
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,341
"Hey, Crayon, do you know
where I can get some drugs?

206
00:08:38,342 --> 00:08:39,536
I need them."

207
00:08:39,554 --> 00:08:41,696
"Unfortunately,
you can get them anywhere."

208
00:08:41,697 --> 00:08:43,544
- "Anywhere?"
- I'm here!

209
00:08:43,546 --> 00:08:45,142
Zabba-da-zooey!

210
00:08:49,336 --> 00:08:50,293
Good one.

211
00:08:51,548 --> 00:08:52,841
Well, doesn't seem
to hurt anything,

212
00:08:52,842 --> 00:08:55,639
so let's get into costume
and break a stinger!

213
00:08:56,241 --> 00:08:57,311
For the bees.

214
00:08:57,778 --> 00:08:59,267
Annie, uh...

215
00:08:59,268 --> 00:09:02,418
I-I don't feel comfortable
with the zabba-da-zooey line.

216
00:09:02,419 --> 00:09:03,529
The one you wrote?

217
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:04,615
I got it!

218
00:09:04,764 --> 00:09:06,961
Let's give Jeff the
zabba-da-zooey line,

219
00:09:06,962 --> 00:09:08,802
and then I'll come
in with a good one.

220
00:09:08,802 --> 00:09:10,902
- Yeah...
- It's more my voice.

221
00:09:10,903 --> 00:09:12,525
Pretty sure Jeff is
gonna reject that idea.

222
00:09:12,527 --> 00:09:14,418
Yeah, you're probably right.

223
00:09:14,418 --> 00:09:15,784
You're the producer.

224
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,798
By the way, is this your pen?

225
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:20,365
I...think I put it
back in my pocket

226
00:09:20,365 --> 00:09:22,881
after I wrote you
that check yesterday.

227
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,763
I'll give it to you later.

228
00:09:25,845 --> 00:09:26,955
I'll talk to Jeff.

229
00:09:26,956 --> 00:09:28,892
Also, I think it'd be
better for my character

230
00:09:28,893 --> 00:09:30,460
if I wear his leather jacket.

231
00:09:32,602 --> 00:09:33,623
Okay!

232
00:09:33,731 --> 00:09:37,230
Welcome to Greendale's
Drug Awareness Show!

233
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:40,986
Okay. Our volunteers

234
00:09:40,988 --> 00:09:45,869
are handing out drug-free
baseballs, huh?

235
00:09:46,013 --> 00:09:48,269
Next time you think about drugs,

236
00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:51,000
think about baseball instead.

237
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,520
Can't ignore me forever.

238
00:09:56,341 --> 00:09:57,856
Okay, you probably can...

239
00:09:59,716 --> 00:10:01,160
I don't know why you want to.

240
00:10:02,344 --> 00:10:04,230
I don't know if I told
you my nephew Marcus

241
00:10:04,231 --> 00:10:06,053
actually goes to San
Ramone middle school,

242
00:10:06,054 --> 00:10:07,823
and he's coming to see the show.

243
00:10:07,825 --> 00:10:10,342
- Marcus? Your nephew?
- Yeah, he's 14.

244
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:12,056
I actually thought he
didn't even like me,

245
00:10:12,057 --> 00:10:14,167
but then he texted me out
of nowhere and he said,

246
00:10:14,168 --> 00:10:14,955
"Can't wait to see you.

247
00:10:14,956 --> 00:10:16,650
"I've been looking forward
to this for so long.

248
00:10:16,652 --> 00:10:18,899
You are the coolest
aunt in the world."

249
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:20,624
I hope that I don't let him down.

250
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:22,950
- You'll be great.
- What does this symbol mean?

251
00:10:22,951 --> 00:10:24,480
It's a number eight,
an equal sign,

252
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,789
and then a greater than symbol.

253
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:26,931
Let me see.

254
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,168
You'd better get changed.

255
00:10:28,168 --> 00:10:29,328
I'll hang onto your stuff for you.

256
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:30,296
Great.

257
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:34,966
Abed, we screwed up.

258
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,336
You know that text we sent?

259
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:37,986
It was to Britta's nephew.

260
00:10:38,134 --> 00:10:40,094
He sent her an emoti-penis.

261
00:10:40,095 --> 00:10:41,352
What are we gonna do?

262
00:10:45,591 --> 00:10:46,701
Fine. Screw you, Abed.

263
00:10:46,701 --> 00:10:47,986
I can fix this.

264
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,171
"Marcus, I made a mistake.

265
00:10:50,172 --> 00:10:52,408
I texted the wrong
person last night."

266
00:10:56,037 --> 00:10:58,277
"You called me by name.
It wasn't a mistake.

267
00:10:58,278 --> 00:10:59,586
Don't be afraid."

268
00:11:02,214 --> 00:11:03,409
Screw you, Abed.

269
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:05,447
"I was drunk. We can't do this."

270
00:11:08,451 --> 00:11:10,982
"I'm drunk too. On lust."

271
00:11:11,309 --> 00:11:12,462
There's a picture.

272
00:11:12,642 --> 00:11:14,690
Oh! That's disappointing.

273
00:11:14,691 --> 00:11:16,504
Wow, who does that? That's...

274
00:11:16,505 --> 00:11:19,009
Bees, you're up.
Cool cats, your on deck.

275
00:11:19,677 --> 00:11:22,043
- Aren't drugs bad?
- No way.

276
00:11:22,043 --> 00:11:23,488
Drugs are like special honey.

277
00:11:23,489 --> 00:11:25,696
They give you a buzzzzzzz.

278
00:11:25,697 --> 00:11:28,187
Don't call me "honey," honey.

279
00:11:31,017 --> 00:11:32,590
Are you ignoring me
because I'm Korean?

280
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:34,332
- You're Chinese.
- Oh, there's a difference?

281
00:11:34,334 --> 00:11:35,417
Shh!

282
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:38,245
It's because you're crazy,
all right?

283
00:11:38,336 --> 00:11:39,447
There's something wrong with you.

284
00:11:39,447 --> 00:11:42,037
And the idea that I was with you

285
00:11:42,384 --> 00:11:44,133
means there's something
wrong with me,

286
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,775
and if this baby...

287
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:48,759
If you have any humanity at all,

288
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,145
you will not make
me think about it.

289
00:11:50,147 --> 00:11:51,311
Shirley, funeral.

290
00:11:59,437 --> 00:12:00,995
Well, that answers my question.

291
00:12:00,996 --> 00:12:05,325
Jeff Winger is sexy
even in a coffin. Mmm!

292
00:12:11,586 --> 00:12:12,442
I'm here.

293
00:12:12,443 --> 00:12:14,355
Pierce, you're
supposed to be onstage.

294
00:12:14,356 --> 00:12:16,145
I was looking for a lighter.

295
00:12:16,917 --> 00:12:18,869
What are you wearing?
This is a funeral.

296
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,113
I got this, Annie.

297
00:12:20,859 --> 00:12:22,831
I can't believe Fluffy's dead.

298
00:12:22,831 --> 00:12:26,107
I know I'm green, but I feel blue.

299
00:12:29,438 --> 00:12:32,911
Look, it's Drugs with a
crazy wig and sparklers.

300
00:12:32,912 --> 00:12:35,547
♪ Pokemon ♪

301
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,721
I don't think
that's right, Drugs.

302
00:12:38,721 --> 00:12:41,334
Nobody asked you, Crayon.

303
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,999
Oh! Oh!

304
00:12:47,687 --> 00:12:49,447
Well, I hope you're
proud of yourself, Drugs.

305
00:12:49,448 --> 00:12:50,663
Look what you've done.

306
00:12:50,673 --> 00:12:53,373
Oh, yeah? Well,
look what I'm doing now.

307
00:12:58,081 --> 00:13:00,613
Smells like something
died in here.

308
00:13:03,655 --> 00:13:04,389
What do you want us to do?

309
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:05,173
Should we get the dean?

310
00:13:05,173 --> 00:13:06,659
Should we call in a bomb threat?

311
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,013
Should we set off the sprinklers?

312
00:13:08,014 --> 00:13:09,038
It's not that big a deal.

313
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,164
I think the kids are into it.

314
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,557
Yeah, but I don't think that
they're getting the message.

315
00:13:12,557 --> 00:13:13,884
Yeah, but do kids
ever really seem

316
00:13:13,885 --> 00:13:15,309
like they're getting the message?

317
00:13:15,311 --> 00:13:16,793
I think it's sinking in.

318
00:13:16,794 --> 00:13:18,101
Well, I guess it's your call.

319
00:13:18,102 --> 00:13:19,974
And anyway, he's about to
get flushed down the toilet

320
00:13:19,975 --> 00:13:22,043
in the next scene,
and he'll be done.

321
00:13:24,119 --> 00:13:26,740
I wish I had never
even met Drugs.

322
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:30,931
Who invited the
nerd from the beehive?

323
00:13:31,951 --> 00:13:33,213
Drugs made you.

324
00:13:37,378 --> 00:13:39,381
How about you leave, Drugs?

325
00:13:40,626 --> 00:13:42,803
Zip, pop, zoom.

326
00:13:42,804 --> 00:13:44,851
Whoosh!

327
00:13:48,284 --> 00:13:49,485
They want more.

328
00:13:49,486 --> 00:13:50,700
I gotta go back out there.

329
00:13:50,701 --> 00:13:52,841
But Pierce, you were flushed.
That was the story.

330
00:13:52,841 --> 00:13:54,744
That's what's supposed
to happen to Drugs.

331
00:13:54,745 --> 00:13:56,567
Being flushed doesn't
necessarily mean you're dead.

332
00:13:56,568 --> 00:13:58,965
I mean, I could be a floater.

333
00:13:59,298 --> 00:14:01,530
You know, a floater is when
you have a number two...

334
00:14:01,532 --> 00:14:03,589
I know what a floater is,
Pierce.

335
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,227
It just... it wouldn't
make any sense

336
00:14:05,229 --> 00:14:08,340
in the flow of the show,
and it sends a mixed message.

337
00:14:08,341 --> 00:14:09,922
You know what I think
is a mixed message?

338
00:14:09,923 --> 00:14:12,528
Yesterday you couldn't pay your rent,
and today you can.

339
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,833
Come on, Annie.
You and I are alike.

340
00:14:15,835 --> 00:14:18,479
We're independent.
We need each other.

341
00:14:19,889 --> 00:14:22,912
♪ yi yi yi yi yi ♪

342
00:14:22,913 --> 00:14:25,661
Bzzz! Getting rid of
Drugs is a great I-bee-a.

343
00:14:26,152 --> 00:14:28,240
I'm flying higher
than I ever have,

344
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,157
thanks to not Drugs.

345
00:14:32,332 --> 00:14:34,370
- Hey!
- Hey!

346
00:14:35,171 --> 00:14:36,163
Ow! Hey!

347
00:14:37,397 --> 00:14:39,153
I'm back!

348
00:14:41,533 --> 00:14:45,105
Ain't no party without Drugs!

349
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,294
I love you, Drugs!

350
00:15:03,533 --> 00:15:05,268
We want Drugs! We want Drugs!

351
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:08,197
Listen to that!
They're high on me!

352
00:15:08,251 --> 00:15:09,537
I'm a God!

353
00:15:11,235 --> 00:15:13,357
Where is that Nigel now?

354
00:15:13,643 --> 00:15:15,958
And I haven't even used
my penis material yet.

355
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,273
Pierce, enough!

356
00:15:17,274 --> 00:15:19,303
After intermission, I'm going
back to the original script

357
00:15:19,304 --> 00:15:20,857
and doing some damage control.

358
00:15:20,859 --> 00:15:21,778
Damage?

359
00:15:21,778 --> 00:15:22,936
The only damage is me

360
00:15:22,937 --> 00:15:24,900
blowing the roof off the universe.

361
00:15:24,902 --> 00:15:27,403
I am not letting you
go back on that stage!

362
00:15:27,404 --> 00:15:29,044
Well, maybe I won't
be visiting you

363
00:15:29,046 --> 00:15:32,394
late at night anymore
with a generous spirit.

364
00:15:34,822 --> 00:15:39,413
You sick, sick, sad old man.

365
00:15:39,413 --> 00:15:41,269
This is why I didn't want to
take money from my parents.

366
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:43,019
I don't want anybody
pulling my strings.

367
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:45,536
Wait, wait.
Is he giving you money?

368
00:15:45,537 --> 00:15:46,684
Not anymore.

369
00:15:46,686 --> 00:15:47,661
That's why the
script got changed.

370
00:15:47,662 --> 00:15:50,099
Pierce bought his way in.
Annie sold out her message.

371
00:15:50,234 --> 00:15:52,360
You've been
indulging this maniac?

372
00:15:53,693 --> 00:15:56,908
Yes. I've been
indulging this maniac.

373
00:15:58,486 --> 00:16:00,561
- You're fired.
- Fired?

374
00:16:00,562 --> 00:16:02,129
Next time I'm at Dildopolis,

375
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:04,431
I will not be coming
upstairs to say hi.

376
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,929
We want Drugs! We want Drugs!

377
00:16:07,931 --> 00:16:09,664
The only reason we
did this was for you

378
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,017
and your stupid ideals,

379
00:16:11,018 --> 00:16:12,888
and it turns out you
don't even have any.

380
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:14,355
We supported you, Annie.

381
00:16:14,356 --> 00:16:16,282
Yeah, Annie, you're fired.

382
00:16:16,924 --> 00:16:18,192
I'm sorry!

383
00:16:19,397 --> 00:16:20,703
Here's the situation.

384
00:16:20,705 --> 00:16:23,232
We've got 50 at-risk preteens,

385
00:16:23,234 --> 00:16:25,856
armed with baseballs,
chanting for Drugs,

386
00:16:25,857 --> 00:16:26,755
who just spent intermission

387
00:16:26,756 --> 00:16:29,466
eating nothing but
Charleston Chews, thank God.

388
00:16:29,548 --> 00:16:32,033
Hope you can top act one,
is all I'm saying.

389
00:16:32,277 --> 00:16:34,209
Oh! Whoops.

390
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:36,720
We want Drugs!

391
00:16:36,721 --> 00:16:38,669
- Should we bail?
- Works for me.

392
00:16:38,826 --> 00:16:39,417
Wait!

393
00:16:39,418 --> 00:16:41,370
We want Drugs!

394
00:16:42,142 --> 00:16:43,571
Listen to those kids.

395
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,477
We just created 50
potential meth heads,

396
00:16:46,479 --> 00:16:48,536
and the least we can do
is hit the reset button

397
00:16:48,537 --> 00:16:51,009
and get that number down
to the national average.

398
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:52,212
That's a suicide mission.

399
00:16:52,213 --> 00:16:54,902
Did someone say crazy person?

400
00:16:56,577 --> 00:16:57,669
No.

401
00:16:58,201 --> 00:16:59,561
Well, I heard it.

402
00:16:59,562 --> 00:17:03,087
We want Drugs! We want Drugs!

403
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:05,750
Greetings, you little snots!

404
00:17:07,729 --> 00:17:08,906
You're not Drugs.

405
00:17:08,907 --> 00:17:10,781
Oh, but I am!

406
00:17:11,005 --> 00:17:12,942
Disappointed?

407
00:17:13,372 --> 00:17:16,965
Did you expect me to
stay the same forever?

408
00:17:16,967 --> 00:17:19,779
'Cause that's not
what drug does, baby.

409
00:17:20,259 --> 00:17:23,636
I'm gonna deep-fry your dog
and eat your mama's face

410
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:27,626
and I'm gonna wear your little
brother's skin like pajamas.

411
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:30,088
I control your lives

412
00:17:30,089 --> 00:17:33,259
and there is nothing you can do!

413
00:17:33,943 --> 00:17:35,084
Let's kill him!

414
00:17:35,085 --> 00:17:37,096
Oh, bring it on, bow-wow.

415
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,973
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, my!

416
00:17:39,146 --> 00:17:40,270
Aah! Aah!

417
00:17:42,552 --> 00:17:44,085
Is that all you've got?

418
00:17:44,673 --> 00:17:45,645
I gotta tell you, Annie,

419
00:17:45,646 --> 00:17:47,958
this is the greatest
chemical dependency program

420
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:49,558
I have ever watched.

421
00:17:49,719 --> 00:17:50,789
I mean, the way you got the kids

422
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,815
to think that they needed Drugs,

423
00:17:52,816 --> 00:17:54,109
and then having them realize

424
00:17:54,111 --> 00:17:55,766
that dependence was the enemy,

425
00:17:55,767 --> 00:17:57,207
that the price was just too high.

426
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:58,531
Oh, genius.

427
00:17:59,576 --> 00:18:01,153
So now that the show is over,

428
00:18:01,153 --> 00:18:03,875
what is the plan for
these bee costumes?

429
00:18:03,876 --> 00:18:06,182
Aah! Aah! Uncle!

430
00:18:06,438 --> 00:18:08,442
Hi, Marcus. I'm Jeff.

431
00:18:08,442 --> 00:18:11,560
I'm like, uh, Britta's boyfriend.

432
00:18:11,682 --> 00:18:13,029
Look, dude,
she started it, okay?

433
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,653
- She's just as into me.
- No, listen, listen.

434
00:18:14,654 --> 00:18:15,510
I'm not mad.

435
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,662
I was just fooling around,

436
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:18,306
and I sent those texts.

437
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:19,901
- Gross.
- Yeah.

438
00:18:19,902 --> 00:18:21,011
Well, it was pretty disgusting,

439
00:18:21,012 --> 00:18:22,800
sending those
pictures to your aunt.

440
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:24,259
More disgusting
than what you texted

441
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,426
to an underage boy?

442
00:18:25,428 --> 00:18:26,913
Yeah, well,
I didn't know you were you.

443
00:18:26,914 --> 00:18:28,425
And I didn't know
you weren't my aunt.

444
00:18:28,426 --> 00:18:28,957
Okay, all right,

445
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:30,833
let's just call this a draw.

446
00:18:30,907 --> 00:18:32,980
Britta doesn't need to
ever know about this.

447
00:18:32,981 --> 00:18:35,978
Okay, I'd be happy to,
for a price.

448
00:18:37,892 --> 00:18:39,480
That was brave of you.

449
00:18:40,163 --> 00:18:42,123
I owe you an apology.

450
00:18:42,508 --> 00:18:44,361
It was rude to call you crazy.

451
00:18:44,845 --> 00:18:46,865
Maybe I haven't been
giving you enough credit.

452
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,412
Oh, that's really sweet.
Tell you what.

453
00:18:50,413 --> 00:18:53,874
Why don't I go get Chang?
You can tell him that yourself.

454
00:18:56,709 --> 00:18:58,733
- Oh, no.
- My God, that was amazing!

455
00:18:58,882 --> 00:19:00,451
- Wow!
- Good job!

456
00:19:00,451 --> 00:19:02,416
- Thanks!
- Amazing!

457
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:04,349
Way to go, man,
go! That was awesome.

458
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:06,188
They beat the crap out of you.

459
00:19:07,152 --> 00:19:08,165
It's okay.
I did a lot of ad-libbing.

460
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:11,327
Guys, I'm so sorry.

461
00:19:11,328 --> 00:19:13,683
Thank you so much.
That was amazing.

462
00:19:13,873 --> 00:19:15,035
Even I learned something.

463
00:19:15,036 --> 00:19:17,423
- Oh, Annie.
- We did it.

464
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:19,789
- Group hug, group hug.
- Hug, hug.

465
00:19:19,795 --> 00:19:21,830
- Way to save the day.
- Nice work.

466
00:19:23,115 --> 00:19:25,500
Did you get hit in the
face with a baseball?

467
00:19:25,501 --> 00:19:26,163
Yep.

468
00:19:26,164 --> 00:19:27,714
Annie, before you say anything,

469
00:19:27,715 --> 00:19:29,170
I just want you to know,

470
00:19:29,286 --> 00:19:30,660
even though I did nothing wrong,

471
00:19:30,661 --> 00:19:31,566
I'm still gonna give you money.

472
00:19:31,567 --> 00:19:33,921
No. I can't take
your money, Pierce.

473
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,829
I can't go from
depending on my parents

474
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,135
to depending on you,

475
00:19:37,136 --> 00:19:39,704
which is why I'm gonna get a job.

476
00:19:39,705 --> 00:19:41,511
So you're cutting me off?

477
00:19:41,644 --> 00:19:42,452
No.

478
00:19:42,453 --> 00:19:45,405
Pierce, I know you
don't depend on anyone,

479
00:19:45,406 --> 00:19:47,907
but you do depend on
people depending on you,

480
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,871
so I'm not gonna take your money.

481
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,595
We're still friends?

482
00:19:51,596 --> 00:19:52,752
Give me a day.

483
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:54,662
By the way,

484
00:19:54,874 --> 00:19:57,030
your mom was the
Period Fairy, right?

485
00:19:57,851 --> 00:19:59,177
Hey, guys, I found my phone,

486
00:19:59,179 --> 00:20:01,061
but has anyone seen my bra?

487
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:07,961
It's 2:00 A.M.

488
00:20:07,962 --> 00:20:11,340
Time for Dildopolis's
night-owl deals.

489
00:20:11,796 --> 00:20:12,893
Please be advised,

490
00:20:12,894 --> 00:20:15,155
we will be closed
for President's Day.

491
00:20:15,156 --> 00:20:16,095
Just kidding.

492
00:20:16,096 --> 00:20:18,050
Dildopolis never closes.

493
00:20:18,672 --> 00:20:22,237
At Dildopolis, your privacy
is our top concern.

494
00:20:22,238 --> 00:20:24,661
All store purchases will
show up on your credit card

495
00:20:24,662 --> 00:20:27,767
as ABC Dildos, incorporated.

496
00:20:28,086 --> 00:20:29,442
Shop until you drop.

497
00:20:29,442 --> 00:20:31,588
Take a load off at
our in-store cafe

498
00:20:31,589 --> 00:20:32,718
and enjoy an espresso

499
00:20:32,719 --> 00:20:36,491
or our signature
cinnamon biscotti.
