1
00:00:04,234 --> 00:00:05,619
You're ready for the bus driver, Winger?

2
00:00:05,926 --> 00:00:07,568
You know why they call me bus driver, right?

3
00:00:07,569 --> 00:00:08,943
Because you been
travelin' all day?

4
00:00:08,944 --> 00:00:10,610
Because I'm taking
your butt to school.

5
00:00:13,576 --> 00:00:14,415
Nice.

6
00:00:15,235 --> 00:00:16,172
Cool, I'm up.

7
00:00:16,173 --> 00:00:17,922
Nuh-uh. Game's to 15.

8
00:00:17,923 --> 00:00:19,563
- Since when?
- Since you scored 11.

9
00:00:19,564 --> 00:00:21,516
Sorry, Abed, I have to
finish kicking Troy's butt

10
00:00:21,517 --> 00:00:22,524
before I can get to yours.

11
00:00:22,525 --> 00:00:24,339
See? All that angry
talk about butts.

12
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,072
"Kick your butt. Stomp your butt.

13
00:00:26,073 --> 00:00:26,847
Punch your butt."

14
00:00:26,848 --> 00:00:28,184
Do they say, "punch your butt"?

15
00:00:28,185 --> 00:00:30,623
Point being hatred of
each other's butts.

16
00:00:30,624 --> 00:00:33,039
Men play sports so they
can seek out and destroy

17
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,388
their own sensitivity.

18
00:00:34,389 --> 00:00:36,498
Oh! I never thought
about it that way.

19
00:00:36,499 --> 00:00:38,007
Do you think we'll learn
about stuff like that

20
00:00:38,008 --> 00:00:39,387
in our women's studies class?

21
00:00:39,388 --> 00:00:40,223
Hell, no!

22
00:00:40,224 --> 00:00:41,881
We're gonna find our
roots in that class.

23
00:00:41,882 --> 00:00:44,286
And stop defining our
gender by theirs.

24
00:00:44,287 --> 00:00:45,210
Well, I feel bad saying it,

25
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,645
but it will be nice to
get away from the boys

26
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:48,333
and take a class with just us.

27
00:00:48,334 --> 00:00:51,881
Amen. Or "a-wo-men."

28
00:00:52,175 --> 00:00:53,144
Am I right?

29
00:00:53,145 --> 00:00:54,862
Bring it in for a
boob bump, ladies.

30
00:00:54,863 --> 00:00:57,046
Uh...
Nope?

31
00:00:57,169 --> 00:00:58,322
We'll get there.

32
00:00:58,717 --> 00:00:59,935
Hey, guys.

33
00:01:00,094 --> 00:01:01,169
Remember last week when you were

34
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,886
playing with those
remote control cars

35
00:01:02,887 --> 00:01:04,465
and you thought you
were real cool?

36
00:01:04,466 --> 00:01:05,813
Well, turns out you're not.

37
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,247
Draganflyer, bee-otch.

38
00:01:10,094 --> 00:01:11,318
Yep, uh, four propellers.

39
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:13,417
It's got a built-in spy cam.

40
00:01:13,418 --> 00:01:15,684
100 yards.

41
00:01:15,753 --> 00:01:18,045
And it'll strangle your
stupid cars' little butts.

42
00:01:18,046 --> 00:01:19,846
- Pierce, we're in a game.
- Yeah.

43
00:01:20,153 --> 00:01:21,980
And we're really not
into R.C. anymore.

44
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:24,512
What? It's... it's a draganflyer.

45
00:01:29,067 --> 00:01:30,714
Come on, Pierce, man.
This is a school.

46
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:32,168
- I can't control it.
- Watch it.

47
00:01:32,169 --> 00:01:33,447
There's a little pilot in there.

48
00:01:33,448 --> 00:01:34,767
- It's not funny, Pierce!
- Propellers are sharp!

49
00:01:34,768 --> 00:01:35,720
Stop it!

50
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:40,290
Knuckle walkers!

51
00:01:40,417 --> 00:01:41,651
Ahh.

52
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,083
Sorry, it was an accident.

53
00:01:43,084 --> 00:01:44,505
So was the "y" chromosome,

54
00:01:44,506 --> 00:01:46,618
but you don't see us
throwing stuff at it.

55
00:01:50,779 --> 00:01:51,820
Where you guys going?

56
00:01:51,821 --> 00:01:53,794
Away from your
symbolically invasive balls

57
00:01:53,795 --> 00:01:55,578
to a women's studies class.

58
00:01:56,685 --> 00:01:58,077
Which women's studies class?

59
00:01:58,087 --> 00:02:00,354
Feminist
representations in media.

60
00:02:00,424 --> 00:02:02,394
- I'm in.
- Oh, uh, Abed,

61
00:02:02,395 --> 00:02:04,541
we kind of thought this would
be something just for the girls.

62
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:05,619
Sounds like it.

63
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,141
I'd love to learn more about you.

64
00:02:07,142 --> 00:02:09,139
I'll change out of my sports
clothes and meet you there.

65
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,368
- Uh...
- We...Um...

66
00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:15,724
♪ You just lost. ♪

67
00:02:15,978 --> 00:02:21,334
♪You just lost a game. You just
lost you just lost a game, ♪

68
00:02:21,533 --> 00:02:23,398
♪ with Troy ♪♪
- Uhh!

69
00:02:26,841 --> 00:02:28,083
Hey, sore loser.

70
00:02:28,354 --> 00:02:29,643
Yeah... proud of it.

71
00:02:29,644 --> 00:02:30,894
I want a rematch.

75
00:03:27,301 --> 00:03:28,020
Hey, guys.

76
00:03:28,021 --> 00:03:29,515
I raced here so I could
save us four seats.

77
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,536
Thanks, Abed.

78
00:03:31,537 --> 00:03:34,933
But...Annie can't see the
board from this far back.

79
00:03:34,934 --> 00:03:36,343
She lost her glasses.

80
00:03:36,344 --> 00:03:37,382
I've never seen
you wear glasses.

81
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,670
Yeah, I usually wear contacts,

82
00:03:38,671 --> 00:03:41,267
but I couldn't find them...
Without my glasses.

83
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:42,711
Which I wear.

84
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:44,370
Cool-cool-cool.

85
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:46,304
Are we bad people?

86
00:03:46,305 --> 00:03:47,855
No. I love Abed.

87
00:03:47,856 --> 00:03:49,403
But sometimes he
can't take a hint.

88
00:03:49,404 --> 00:03:51,456
We told him...
this is a girl thing.

89
00:03:51,536 --> 00:03:52,660
Ahem.

90
00:03:52,779 --> 00:03:53,784
'Scuse me.

91
00:03:54,086 --> 00:03:55,125
We were gonna sit there.

92
00:03:55,126 --> 00:03:56,962
Oh, uh, sorry. We didn't know.

93
00:03:56,963 --> 00:04:00,373
But now we're sitting here, so...
That's the problem.

94
00:04:00,374 --> 00:04:02,637
You don't seriously
expect us to get up

95
00:04:02,638 --> 00:04:04,439
and change seats for you?

96
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,553
Well, if you're further in back,
less people will see your roots.

97
00:04:07,673 --> 00:04:09,601
Um...Excuse me?

98
00:04:09,602 --> 00:04:12,184
Oh, the way you excuse
your little moustache hairs?

99
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,982
Uh, you know what?

100
00:04:13,983 --> 00:04:14,854
We're good people.

101
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:16,857
So we will find seats elsewhere.

102
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:18,284
It's called the high road.

103
00:04:18,285 --> 00:04:19,985
I hope it leads to a salon.

104
00:04:24,642 --> 00:04:25,413
You're back.

105
00:04:25,414 --> 00:04:27,288
I've seen 'em before.
The leader's name is Meghan.

106
00:04:27,289 --> 00:04:29,198
Of course! Why name
your daughter Meghan?

107
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,952
Are you stocking up
for a bitch shortage?

108
00:04:30,953 --> 00:04:31,792
Which one's Meghan?

109
00:04:31,793 --> 00:04:33,001
The one with the hole
in her sweater's armpit,

110
00:04:33,002 --> 00:04:34,308
or the one whose tight
sleeves are pushing her fat

111
00:04:34,309 --> 00:04:35,697
toward her elbows?

112
00:04:36,863 --> 00:04:38,846
No, those are her cronies.

113
00:04:38,847 --> 00:04:39,841
So Meghan's the one
with the crooked ears

114
00:04:39,842 --> 00:04:42,022
- and no ankles?
- Ha! Damn.

115
00:04:42,023 --> 00:04:43,564
Sorry, I over-described again?

116
00:04:43,565 --> 00:04:44,664
Oh, no, Abed.

117
00:04:44,665 --> 00:04:46,855
Describe those girls all you want.

118
00:04:46,856 --> 00:04:48,637
Yeah. In fact,
what are you doing for lunch?

119
00:04:48,638 --> 00:04:50,492
It's Wednesday.
Sometimes I eat in Jeff's car.

120
00:04:50,721 --> 00:04:51,873
Don't tell him.

121
00:04:54,649 --> 00:04:56,069
Troy, where are you?

122
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,715
You would go this far
to avoid a rematch?

123
00:05:04,894 --> 00:05:05,859
Jeff!

124
00:05:06,209 --> 00:05:07,502
What is this thing?

125
00:05:07,757 --> 00:05:10,950
In my line of work, a
multimillion dollar injury suit.

126
00:05:11,675 --> 00:05:13,653
I thought schools got
rid of these things.

127
00:05:14,361 --> 00:05:16,144
I can't believe
Greendale allows it.

128
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,617
Greendale doesn't.

129
00:05:18,127 --> 00:05:19,495
That's why it's hidden.

130
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,487
Who else saw you come in?

131
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:22,629
If we say nobody,

132
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:25,091
are you doing to stab us
with your bush scissors?

133
00:05:25,672 --> 00:05:26,906
Of course not.

134
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,854
I'm Joshua.

135
00:05:29,127 --> 00:05:31,879
And this is a place
of peace and balance.

136
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,379
A place of nourishment.

137
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:36,013
A place free from darkness.

138
00:05:36,117 --> 00:05:37,743
Because there's a trampoline?

139
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:41,268
There is something cool
about being up here, Jeff.

140
00:05:41,269 --> 00:05:44,272
I mean, at first I was
just jumping, but then...

141
00:05:44,273 --> 00:05:45,764
But then you started bouncing...

142
00:05:46,353 --> 00:05:48,011
Like a baby on the
knee of a goddess.

143
00:05:48,012 --> 00:05:48,972
Yes!

144
00:05:49,187 --> 00:05:50,213
Yes.

145
00:05:50,322 --> 00:05:52,376
Jeff, get on.

146
00:05:52,377 --> 00:05:54,599
Ah, one at a time, please.

147
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:57,020
I must as you to adhere
to two simple principles.

148
00:05:57,021 --> 00:06:01,316
First, for this place to
survive, it must stay secret.

149
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:02,663
And second...

150
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:05,866
No double bounces.

151
00:06:10,462 --> 00:06:11,860
Feet shoulder width apart.

152
00:06:12,484 --> 00:06:13,589
Knees bent.

153
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:15,310
And just breathe.

154
00:06:15,786 --> 00:06:18,215
At the apex of each
bounce there is a moment,

155
00:06:18,216 --> 00:06:22,706
outside of time, outside of words...
Outside of everything.

156
00:06:23,034 --> 00:06:26,057
A perfect moment. A silent moment.

157
00:06:33,382 --> 00:06:35,345
I call it the world's whisper.

158
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,880
Wow...You're right.

159
00:06:38,845 --> 00:06:42,165
And I don't mind admitting
you're right, which is weird.

160
00:06:43,467 --> 00:06:46,461
30 seconds on this thing, and
I already feel... Jeff...

161
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:48,871
You've been up there for an hour.

162
00:06:56,652 --> 00:06:57,497
Yes.

163
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:04,468
Okay, Abed,
girl in the pink... go.

164
00:07:04,503 --> 00:07:06,373
Her forehead hangs over
her head like a canopy.

165
00:07:06,386 --> 00:07:08,936
She missed a belt loop, and her
stomach spills over her shorts.

166
00:07:09,653 --> 00:07:12,425
- Target destroyed.
- What brutality.

167
00:07:12,426 --> 00:07:14,330
It's called a muffin top, Abed.

168
00:07:14,331 --> 00:07:16,277
Like a muffin? Clever.

169
00:07:16,773 --> 00:07:18,645
But you guys said it's rude
to focus on imperfections.

170
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:19,938
This the stuff I'm
supposed to filter, right?

171
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:20,932
Absolutely, Abed.

172
00:07:20,933 --> 00:07:22,364
It's just kind of
a guilty pleasure

173
00:07:22,365 --> 00:07:24,343
to hear it about... certain girls.

174
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:26,627
Like Meghan and her friends,
because they're bitches.

175
00:07:27,586 --> 00:07:30,213
That's nice.
Uh, who needs a soda?

176
00:07:30,214 --> 00:07:31,316
I'll get it...
I'm making you guys so happy,

177
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:32,277
I want to keep it going.

178
00:07:32,278 --> 00:07:33,595
Aww...

179
00:07:34,764 --> 00:07:37,239
Okay, I love Abed so much.

180
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,074
I know, it's like
he's one of the girls.

181
00:07:39,075 --> 00:07:40,316
Uh, guys.

182
00:07:42,999 --> 00:07:45,270
Yeah, do you mind
not looking at me?

183
00:07:45,271 --> 00:07:46,821
I don't know, do you
mind that your face makeup

184
00:07:46,822 --> 00:07:48,019
doesn't match your neck?

185
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,802
When I squint,
you look like a circus clown.

186
00:07:52,521 --> 00:07:54,988
Okay, I beg your pardon, geek...

187
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,168
I don't even know your
peanut-headed ass.

188
00:07:57,169 --> 00:07:58,016
You're right, we've never met.

189
00:07:58,017 --> 00:07:59,312
Like your hair and
dandruff shampoo.

190
00:07:59,442 --> 00:08:02,393
Hoo hoo! Filet of Meghan,
service for one.

191
00:08:02,394 --> 00:08:05,278
Okay, Abed,
let's get back to the table.

192
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:07,943
Yeah, Abed. Go with your skank.

193
00:08:07,944 --> 00:08:10,132
Or keep going. Up to you.

194
00:08:10,133 --> 00:08:12,232
Keep going about what,
her uneven bra padding?

195
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:14,031
You look like you're smuggling
a lime and a coconut.

196
00:08:14,032 --> 00:08:16,088
- Ooh!
- Go away, loser.

197
00:08:16,089 --> 00:08:17,932
Good one... tell that to the
stitching on your ratty panties,

198
00:08:17,933 --> 00:08:19,475
or wear higher jeans
on laundry day.

199
00:08:20,619 --> 00:08:23,357
Damn, that diss made me snarf, yo!

200
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:25,094
You know what? You're dead.

201
00:08:25,417 --> 00:08:26,502
You're bowlegged.

202
00:08:26,585 --> 00:08:28,842
Bye. See ya.

203
00:08:28,843 --> 00:08:30,253
Women of Greendale!

204
00:08:30,254 --> 00:08:33,830
This cafeteria has been
declared a bitch-free zone!

205
00:08:33,831 --> 00:08:34,925
Yeah!

206
00:08:53,607 --> 00:08:55,434
Can't tell you how
great I feel right now.

207
00:08:55,497 --> 00:08:57,987
I wasn't sure that you would
take to the trampoline's ways.

208
00:08:57,988 --> 00:08:59,159
Some can't.

209
00:08:59,813 --> 00:09:02,128
And some are just natural jumpers.

210
00:09:04,388 --> 00:09:05,479
See you tomorrow, Joshua.

211
00:09:06,017 --> 00:09:07,228
We better bounce.

212
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:13,649
Whoa.

213
00:09:14,242 --> 00:09:15,499
That's Sharice.

214
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,492
I had sociology
with her last year.

215
00:09:17,493 --> 00:09:19,784
She told me I walk like a dude.

216
00:09:19,785 --> 00:09:22,335
That's awful! Abed,
you got anything?

217
00:09:22,586 --> 00:09:24,676
I might have something to say
about those jeans she's wearing.

218
00:09:25,215 --> 00:09:26,610
But you guys are
sure it's not bad?

219
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:28,873
Bad isn't that bad when
you're doing it to bad girls.

220
00:09:28,874 --> 00:09:30,400
Yeah, and you're
really good at it.

221
00:09:30,401 --> 00:09:31,574
You're like a machine.

222
00:09:31,575 --> 00:09:34,345
- Like Robocop.
- Exactly like rowboat cop.

223
00:09:34,346 --> 00:09:37,864
Sharice is a bad rowboat.
Sink her.

224
00:09:38,784 --> 00:09:39,874
Affirmative.

225
00:09:52,852 --> 00:09:53,835
They're bad....

226
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,093
bad.

227
00:10:03,999 --> 00:10:07,611
Hey...You dudes ready to shoot
the rock after study group?

228
00:10:07,612 --> 00:10:10,194
I'm gonna slit your
butt's throats.

229
00:10:12,099 --> 00:10:13,664
Nice catch, losers.

230
00:10:14,177 --> 00:10:15,190
Go get it.

231
00:10:15,191 --> 00:10:16,367
Sorry, Pierce.

232
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,266
We're not really into
basketball anymore.

233
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:19,306
What?

234
00:10:19,526 --> 00:10:20,948
What's up with you guys?

235
00:10:21,505 --> 00:10:22,886
Why are you acting like that?

236
00:10:22,887 --> 00:10:23,873
Like what?

237
00:10:24,977 --> 00:10:26,758
Ah! Gay boots!

238
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:27,733
Lady boots!

239
00:10:28,352 --> 00:10:29,656
He's a gaywad.

240
00:10:30,352 --> 00:10:32,172
Are those as
comfortable as they look?

241
00:10:32,353 --> 00:10:34,447
They're like wearing
a pair of dreams.

242
00:10:35,461 --> 00:10:37,377
I'm sure your shoes
are fine, though.

243
00:10:38,725 --> 00:10:39,829
You know what?

244
00:10:40,268 --> 00:10:41,330
They are.

245
00:10:41,483 --> 00:10:44,009
Something's up with you two,
and I want to know what it is.

246
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:45,504
Are you on weed?

247
00:10:46,033 --> 00:10:47,920
Give me some... I'll smoke
you two under the table.

248
00:10:47,921 --> 00:10:49,984
Oh, man, I feel so good.

249
00:10:49,985 --> 00:10:51,772
It's like the whole
campus is a gutter

250
00:10:51,773 --> 00:10:53,466
and we're just spraying it clean.

251
00:10:53,467 --> 00:10:55,145
Abed, I may need you to
come to the bank with me

252
00:10:55,146 --> 00:10:57,855
to have words with a certain
something at window four.

253
00:10:57,856 --> 00:10:58,986
We'll take 'em down.

254
00:10:58,987 --> 00:11:00,562
We'll take all these bitches down.

255
00:11:00,563 --> 00:11:02,290
Ladies, are you okay?

256
00:11:02,781 --> 00:11:03,826
Take it easy.

257
00:11:03,827 --> 00:11:06,767
Um, did you just
tell us what to do?

258
00:11:06,768 --> 00:11:07,824
Here's the thing.

259
00:11:07,825 --> 00:11:08,560
It's a little rule.

260
00:11:08,561 --> 00:11:09,827
Maybe you're not familiar with it.

261
00:11:09,828 --> 00:11:11,862
Nobody tells me what to do... ever.

262
00:11:11,863 --> 00:11:14,403
Whoa, whoa, cowboy. I surrender.

263
00:11:14,404 --> 00:11:15,648
Abed, did you hear that?

264
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:17,069
- Jeff a bitch too?
- Yes.

265
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,203
- Take him down.
- Cool.

266
00:11:18,204 --> 00:11:19,765
Hey, Jeff, what's with the boots?

267
00:11:19,766 --> 00:11:21,572
2008 called to tell you that,
even in 2008,

268
00:11:21,573 --> 00:11:23,978
those were tacky.
Oh, you go, girl!

269
00:11:23,979 --> 00:11:25,985
Daaamn.

270
00:11:27,252 --> 00:11:28,554
Hey, you guys,
why don't we just all

271
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:31,933
take a deep breath and...
Find some center.

272
00:11:31,934 --> 00:11:33,852
Okay, that is it!

273
00:11:33,953 --> 00:11:35,245
What are you hiding from me?

274
00:11:35,246 --> 00:11:37,037
They're keeping
relaxation secrets.

275
00:11:37,038 --> 00:11:40,028
Tell me how to get this laid back,
or I'll kill your families!

276
00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:41,871
Okay, this place is lame.

277
00:11:41,872 --> 00:11:43,092
Girls, Abed.

278
00:11:43,093 --> 00:11:44,193
Toodles.

279
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:48,070
I'm watching you two.

280
00:11:48,311 --> 00:11:51,333
24, 2010.

281
00:11:52,301 --> 00:11:54,760
These balls on your butts.

282
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,508
Quick bounce before lunch?

283
00:11:59,509 --> 00:12:00,557
Absolutely.

284
00:12:00,558 --> 00:12:02,893
Let me just make sure that
Pierce isn't hovering around.

285
00:12:06,646 --> 00:12:07,806
Coast is clear.

286
00:12:40,136 --> 00:12:41,906
What did you see, my pretty?

287
00:12:43,382 --> 00:12:44,229
Wait.

288
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,690
Back, back... freeze it.

289
00:12:46,482 --> 00:12:48,874
Can you blow that up
a little? Enhance.

290
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,301
Enhance.

291
00:12:51,216 --> 00:12:52,630
Enhance.

292
00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:54,284
Stop! That's it.

293
00:12:54,976 --> 00:12:56,057
Blow it up.

294
00:12:58,571 --> 00:12:59,745
There it is.

295
00:13:01,926 --> 00:13:03,397
Um, excuse me, girls.

296
00:13:03,398 --> 00:13:04,902
You're sitting in our seats.

297
00:13:04,903 --> 00:13:06,683
I'm sorry. What did you say?

298
00:13:06,684 --> 00:13:08,625
Oh! I didn't know you were deaf.

299
00:13:08,626 --> 00:13:11,354
I suspected you were
blind from the outfit.

300
00:13:14,008 --> 00:13:14,912
Toodles.

301
00:13:16,251 --> 00:13:17,304
See ya.

302
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,528
Wait a minute.

303
00:13:20,657 --> 00:13:22,280
Why were you mean to them?
Did they insult you?

304
00:13:22,281 --> 00:13:25,018
No, but that top
insulted our retinas.

305
00:13:25,834 --> 00:13:27,413
Go, girl.

306
00:13:28,593 --> 00:13:31,467
Bad isn't that bad when
you're doing it to bad girls.

307
00:13:36,321 --> 00:13:38,230
Annie, when you laugh like that,
you snort like a piglet.

308
00:13:38,907 --> 00:13:41,350
- Careful, Abed.
- Be careful with your skin.

309
00:13:41,351 --> 00:13:42,337
Your face is so puffy right now,

310
00:13:42,338 --> 00:13:43,677
your eyes look like
sewn-on buttons.

311
00:13:43,678 --> 00:13:45,658
You need to check that
attitude at the door, Abed.

312
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,303
You need to check the door before
you go through it, Shirley.

313
00:13:47,304 --> 00:13:48,624
What? What?

314
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:51,514
Abed, you cannot
talk to us that way.

315
00:13:51,515 --> 00:13:53,526
Someone has to.
You guys are being bitches.

316
00:13:54,202 --> 00:13:55,608
We're not bitches!

317
00:13:55,609 --> 00:13:56,817
We were just joking.

318
00:13:56,818 --> 00:13:58,956
If that makes us bitches,
we're all bitches.

319
00:13:58,957 --> 00:14:01,010
- Mm-hmm.
- That's a good point, Annie.

320
00:14:01,011 --> 00:14:01,961
You told him.

321
00:14:01,962 --> 00:14:03,686
Affirmative. You're all bitches.

322
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:05,548
Nice shirt. It would
look better on a girl.

323
00:14:06,421 --> 00:14:07,350
Pick a bronzer.

324
00:14:07,351 --> 00:14:08,962
You're not fooling us with that
band-aid... we knew it's a zit.

325
00:14:08,963 --> 00:14:10,459
You're all bitches.
Triple bitches.

326
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,633
- Ohh!
- Bitch, bitch, bitch.

327
00:14:11,634 --> 00:14:13,114
Hey, bitch. Bitch. You bitch.

328
00:14:13,115 --> 00:14:14,432
I'm a bitch. You're a bitch.

329
00:14:22,255 --> 00:14:23,287
Pierce!

330
00:14:23,751 --> 00:14:24,850
Ha ha!

331
00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:27,334
How did you find us?

332
00:14:27,335 --> 00:14:28,900
Draganflyer, bee-otch.

333
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:30,559
So this is the big secret, huh?

334
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,856
You two sneak out here and hang
out on the big, gay trampoline.

335
00:14:33,857 --> 00:14:35,430
Lower your voice, Pierce.

336
00:14:35,431 --> 00:14:37,346
This is our place of peace.

337
00:14:37,347 --> 00:14:40,144
Yes. And now it's mine too.

338
00:14:41,939 --> 00:14:42,838
Mine.

339
00:14:48,144 --> 00:14:49,607
Oh, this is great!

340
00:14:50,767 --> 00:14:52,095
I wanna go higher!

341
00:14:54,075 --> 00:14:56,745
Pierce...Please...
You're doing it all wrong.

342
00:14:56,746 --> 00:14:57,986
I wanna go higher!

343
00:14:58,072 --> 00:14:59,896
Troy, get up here and
double bounce me.

344
00:15:00,001 --> 00:15:01,643
That's not how
we do things here.

345
00:15:01,644 --> 00:15:03,373
You get up here and
double bounce me,

346
00:15:03,374 --> 00:15:05,369
or I'll tell everybody
about this place!

347
00:15:05,569 --> 00:15:06,546
Come on!

348
00:15:08,355 --> 00:15:10,493
God is my witness,
I will tweet it!

349
00:15:15,724 --> 00:15:16,832
Double bounce me!

350
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,879
Why are you doing this?

351
00:15:19,298 --> 00:15:20,699
Double bounce me! Do it!

352
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,315
Pierce, that's enough.

353
00:15:22,316 --> 00:15:23,696
I hate you.

354
00:15:24,267 --> 00:15:25,798
I hate you!

355
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,506
Double bounce me!

356
00:15:28,538 --> 00:15:29,603
Aah!

357
00:15:29,844 --> 00:15:31,396
Father...

358
00:15:35,323 --> 00:15:36,956
My legs! Ohh!

359
00:15:37,033 --> 00:15:40,790
Oh, my legs, I... illegal trampoline!

360
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:43,255
They have an illegal
trampoline back there!

361
00:15:46,915 --> 00:15:49,050
Whoa, black jeans? Nice try,
Michael Penn.

362
00:15:49,051 --> 00:15:50,661
Those bangs aren't covering
anything, five-head.

363
00:15:50,662 --> 00:15:52,964
Pegged jeans.
Sweater balls. Crows feet.

364
00:15:52,965 --> 00:15:53,893
What's it called
when your back hair

365
00:15:53,894 --> 00:15:55,393
grows into your neck hair
grows into your regular hair?

366
00:15:55,394 --> 00:15:56,732
Look it up, because you have it.

367
00:15:58,168 --> 00:15:59,060
Hmm.

368
00:16:02,608 --> 00:16:04,738
Nice. Who taught you how
to be a juice box? Hmm.

369
00:16:16,129 --> 00:16:17,519
Don't worry. I come in peace.

370
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:19,634
And whatever medicated
shampoo you're using

371
00:16:19,635 --> 00:16:20,839
seems to be doing the trick.

372
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,512
Oh. What do you want?

373
00:16:22,513 --> 00:16:23,998
To restore the natural order.

374
00:16:24,926 --> 00:16:26,084
What are these?

375
00:16:26,158 --> 00:16:27,462
Destruct codes.

376
00:16:36,352 --> 00:16:37,936
Well, that seems
a little excessive.

377
00:16:40,224 --> 00:16:41,273
Joshua.

378
00:16:42,321 --> 00:16:43,920
We were looking for you all over.

379
00:16:44,225 --> 00:16:45,362
Where you going?

380
00:16:45,363 --> 00:16:47,066
I got fired. I'm leaving.

381
00:16:47,067 --> 00:16:49,306
Joshua, we are so sorry.

382
00:16:49,952 --> 00:16:51,286
Don't apologize.

383
00:16:51,339 --> 00:16:52,589
It's my fault.

384
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:55,592
Guess that's what I get for
trusting some black guy.

385
00:16:57,241 --> 00:16:58,264
What?

386
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,510
When you found the trampoline,

387
00:16:59,511 --> 00:17:02,256
I thought the only way to protect
it was to let you use it.

388
00:17:02,405 --> 00:17:04,626
Guess it goes to prove
what I already knew:

389
00:17:04,896 --> 00:17:07,310
Non-whites ruin everything.

390
00:17:10,048 --> 00:17:11,227
Oh, my God.

391
00:17:12,033 --> 00:17:13,907
Joshua was racist.

392
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:15,585
That came out of nowhere.

393
00:17:17,816 --> 00:17:18,884
Did it?

394
00:17:20,552 --> 00:17:22,767
A place free from darkness.

395
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:25,658
And some are just natural jumpers.

396
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,470
It's going to be a maze.

397
00:17:31,228 --> 00:17:32,973
Maybe I just didn't
want to believe it.

398
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,163
Maybe that's the lesson here.

399
00:17:36,942 --> 00:17:39,046
Purity that demands exclusion...

400
00:17:39,432 --> 00:17:41,132
Isn't real purity.

401
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,004
Maybe paradise is a lie.

402
00:17:44,005 --> 00:17:45,223
Not exactly.

403
00:17:47,009 --> 00:17:48,729
Paradise exists.

404
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,405
Right here.

405
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,290
For once... he's actually right.

406
00:17:54,772 --> 00:17:56,300
Let me buy you some ice cream.

407
00:17:56,335 --> 00:17:58,702
My white guilt is
doing somersaults.

408
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,935
Worth it.

409
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,333
Ahh, paradise.

410
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,230
Hey! Horse-neck.

411
00:18:16,026 --> 00:18:18,529
So...What's with the clothes?

412
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,591
I mean, you look like a toddler
who got dressed in the dark.

413
00:18:21,592 --> 00:18:23,348
Aww, snap!

414
00:18:23,349 --> 00:18:24,981
Here it comes, y'all!

415
00:18:24,982 --> 00:18:26,287
Look at your face.

416
00:18:26,288 --> 00:18:30,013
It's like your mom was a lizard
who got raped by a muppet.

417
00:18:31,842 --> 00:18:33,646
And that burn was brought
to you by the letter "s,"

418
00:18:33,647 --> 00:18:35,101
as in snap!

419
00:18:35,832 --> 00:18:36,896
What?

420
00:18:36,897 --> 00:18:38,710
Too hurt to respond?

421
00:18:39,428 --> 00:18:41,485
Uhh! That's right.

422
00:18:41,486 --> 00:18:43,266
You don't have feelings.

423
00:18:43,267 --> 00:18:45,548
See, the rest of us feel
ashamed of ourselves,

424
00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:48,643
so we act like bitches to
make ourselves feel better.

425
00:18:48,644 --> 00:18:50,259
But you did it to fit in.

426
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,083
And no matter how hard you try,

427
00:18:52,521 --> 00:18:53,984
you never will.

428
00:18:55,315 --> 00:18:56,680
Snap. Snap!

429
00:18:56,681 --> 00:18:59,447
Snap! Snap! Snap! Snap!

430
00:18:59,448 --> 00:19:01,875
Give it up! Ooh! Ooh! Snap! Snap!

431
00:19:03,135 --> 00:19:04,250
Yeah! Snap! Snap!

432
00:19:04,251 --> 00:19:08,056
Snap, snap, snap! Woof! Woof!

433
00:19:12,796 --> 00:19:14,080
Abed, are you okay?

434
00:19:14,081 --> 00:19:15,650
That was so cruel.

435
00:19:15,716 --> 00:19:16,843
I deserved it.

436
00:19:16,921 --> 00:19:19,690
I should have never been mean to
anybody, least of all you guys.

437
00:19:19,764 --> 00:19:21,694
I was trying so hard to fit
in that I took it too far.

438
00:19:21,696 --> 00:19:22,798
We took it too far.

439
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,561
We became the kind of
women that we hate,

440
00:19:24,562 --> 00:19:26,180
and we turned you into a monster.

441
00:19:26,181 --> 00:19:28,572
The kind of monster that
makes outlandish statements

442
00:19:28,573 --> 00:19:29,961
about someone's weight.

443
00:19:29,962 --> 00:19:31,265
Those kind of things hurt.

444
00:19:31,266 --> 00:19:32,676
Even when they're not true.

445
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:34,581
And all because
we were insecure.

446
00:19:34,582 --> 00:19:35,441
Everyone is.

447
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:37,152
Even Tom Cruise knows
he's short and nuts.

448
00:19:37,437 --> 00:19:39,460
We're at the mercy of
each other and ourselves.

449
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:41,560
That's why there has to be
forgiveness on both sides.

450
00:19:41,633 --> 00:19:43,795
- Aww...
- Abed...

451
00:19:44,431 --> 00:19:46,461
Oh, my goodness.
What happened to Pierce?

452
00:19:46,496 --> 00:19:47,754
Long story.

453
00:19:48,142 --> 00:19:49,253
Men.

454
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,286
Yeah.

455
00:19:52,897 --> 00:19:54,657
Damn it, Pierce,
will you knock it off?

456
00:19:54,703 --> 00:19:57,187
I told you,
I'm not controlling it.

457
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,480
There's a little man inside.

458
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,855
- Hi.
- Pierce!

459
00:20:03,075 --> 00:20:05,632
Listen, I wanted to
let you know, Pierce,

460
00:20:05,633 --> 00:20:09,793
it's okay to exceed the
recommended daily dosage.

461
00:20:10,146 --> 00:20:12,994
And don't let anybody
tell you different!

462
00:20:16,062 --> 00:20:18,739
Who's going to be in charge of
making sure he doesn't O.D.?

463
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:23,034
What? What... When did
we start doing that?

464
00:20:24,922 --> 00:20:28,074
Three, two, one... Troy and Abed in the mornin'.

465
00:20:28,075 --> 00:20:31,679
And we're back with Greendale's
resident animal expert, Star-Burns.

466
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:32,990
My name's Alex.

467
00:20:32,991 --> 00:20:35,727
Star-burns joins us with
his pet turtle, Shelly.

468
00:20:35,728 --> 00:20:38,371
Now, I understand Shelly can
eat over five mice a day.

469
00:20:38,372 --> 00:20:41,393
- That's impressive.
- Turtles don't eat mice.

470
00:20:41,394 --> 00:20:43,724
- What do they eat?
- I don't know.

471
00:20:43,865 --> 00:20:45,803
Pellets? I have no idea.

472
00:20:45,816 --> 00:20:47,211
- That's disappointing.
- That's not good.

473
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:48,634
Look, what is going on here?

474
00:20:48,635 --> 00:20:50,508
I was studying for
my econ midterm.

475
00:20:50,509 --> 00:20:52,504
You guys walk in,
you hand me this turtle,

476
00:20:52,505 --> 00:20:54,830
and then you tell me to
smile for the folks at home.

477
00:20:54,831 --> 00:20:56,538
What folks at home?

478
00:20:57,444 --> 00:20:59,939
- Ohh.
- Star-burn...

479
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,392
These things give you
salmonella, you know.

480
00:21:02,535 --> 00:21:04,323
Let's go to Gary with
a check on the weather.

481
00:21:04,785 --> 00:21:07,205
I'ts still sunny

481
00:21:08,305 --> 00:21:14,757
