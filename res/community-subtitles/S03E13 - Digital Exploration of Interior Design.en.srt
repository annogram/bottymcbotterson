1
00:00:02,618 --> 00:00:05,486
This is a historic day
for Greendale.

2
00:00:05,487 --> 00:00:10,391
This state-of-the-art Subway
sandwichery in our cafetorium

3
00:00:10,392 --> 00:00:13,177
represents Greendale's
first steps forward

4
00:00:13,178 --> 00:00:15,413
into the realm
of the legitimate!

5
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:16,497
Ooh.

6
00:00:16,498 --> 00:00:18,566
Oh, oh. No problem.
You know what?

7
00:00:18,567 --> 00:00:20,668
I'm just going to get it started
with my teeth.

8
00:00:20,669 --> 00:00:23,187
The legitimate! Oh.
The legitimate!

9
00:00:23,188 --> 00:00:25,006
That should be
my sandwich shop.

10
00:00:25,007 --> 00:00:26,891
It was my idea
to put one there.

11
00:00:26,892 --> 00:00:28,359
- We're here for you, Shirley.
- Yeah.

12
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,177
Troy, Annie, and I know what
it's like to be displaced.

13
00:00:30,178 --> 00:00:32,196
They're tenting our building
for termites, so we're homeless.

14
00:00:32,197 --> 00:00:33,948
I'm staying
in the sleep study lab.

15
00:00:33,949 --> 00:00:35,733
All I have to do is wake up
every three hours and go...

16
00:00:35,734 --> 00:00:38,703
And I get two credits.

17
00:00:38,704 --> 00:00:40,457
Yeah, and we're going to build
a super awesome pillow fort

18
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:42,206
- here at the school.
- Another pillow fort?

19
00:00:42,207 --> 00:00:43,741
Kind of repeating yourselves,
aren't you?

20
00:00:43,742 --> 00:00:46,294
That was a blanket fort.
This will be a pillow fort.

21
00:00:46,295 --> 00:00:48,296
Way more difficult, way better.

22
00:00:48,297 --> 00:00:50,548
All difficult things are better,
like carrying a disease

23
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:52,383
- or holding in a fart right now.
- Aha!

24
00:00:52,384 --> 00:00:55,553
I just found out how Shirley and I
are going to take down Subway.

25
00:00:55,554 --> 00:00:57,221
- Oh, how?
- Dean?

26
00:00:57,222 --> 00:01:00,024
I assume you're familiar
with the Greendale bylaws.

27
00:01:00,025 --> 00:01:02,977
- I am not.
- Shirley, you do the honors.

28
00:01:02,978 --> 00:01:04,896
My brain starts getting weird
this time of night.

29
00:01:04,897 --> 00:01:06,731
It's 10:00 a.m.

30
00:01:06,732 --> 00:01:08,900
- You're welcome.
- Uh-oh.

31
00:01:08,901 --> 00:01:11,152
"Any business operating
for profit on Greendale's campus

32
00:01:11,153 --> 00:01:14,739
must be at least 51% owned by
a registered Greendale student"!

33
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,407
That's too bad, Dean.

34
00:01:16,408 --> 00:01:18,242
I don't recall seeing Subway

35
00:01:18,243 --> 00:01:20,078
in my premenopausal,
postfeminist

36
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:21,863
experiential marketing class.

37
00:01:21,864 --> 00:01:24,082
Actually, I'm on the wait list

38
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:26,584
- for the premen/postfem/ex mark.
- Who are you?

39
00:01:26,585 --> 00:01:29,921
Gang, meet Greendale's
newest student, Subway.

40
00:01:29,922 --> 00:01:31,706
Your name is Subway?

41
00:01:31,707 --> 00:01:35,176
Yep, using a groundbreaking
but surprisingly legal process

42
00:01:35,177 --> 00:01:38,296
known as "corpohumanization",
real people such as myself

43
00:01:38,297 --> 00:01:40,932
are now allowed to represent
the collective humanity

44
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:42,183
of business owners.

45
00:01:42,184 --> 00:01:44,218
I have contractually waived
my birth identity

46
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:49,090
and am now a man and student
named... Subway.

47
00:01:49,091 --> 00:01:51,192
I don't believe this.

48
00:01:51,193 --> 00:01:53,778
Come on, Subway,
there is no way you're 5'10".

49
00:01:53,779 --> 00:01:56,263
So you can vote?

50
00:01:56,264 --> 00:01:58,649
Actually, no, because
technically I'm only a week old.

51
00:01:58,650 --> 00:01:59,951
Aww.

52
00:01:59,952 --> 00:02:00,952
But please don't think of me

53
00:02:00,953 --> 00:02:02,236
as any less human
than yourselves.

54
00:02:02,237 --> 00:02:04,322
I'm here to hang out,
take weird classes,

55
00:02:04,323 --> 00:02:07,375
and party as hearty
as my morality clause allows.

56
00:02:07,376 --> 00:02:10,411
Eat fresh? Eat fresh?

57
00:02:10,412 --> 00:02:12,463
- Eat fresh.
- That's my man.

58
00:02:12,464 --> 00:02:13,998
Wow, did you know
Greendale students

59
00:02:13,999 --> 00:02:16,746
are technically
in the army reserves?

60
00:02:18,453 --> 00:02:20,755
Let's say a little prayer
for peace.

61
00:02:21,624 --> 00:02:24,809
♪ Give me some rope,
time in a tree ♪

62
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,979
♪ Give me the hope
to run out of steam ♪

63
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:31,482
♪ Somebody said
we could be here ♪

64
00:02:31,483 --> 00:02:35,403
♪ We could be roped up,
tied up, dead in a year ♪

65
00:02:35,404 --> 00:02:40,358
♪ I can't count the reasons
I should stay ♪

66
00:02:40,359 --> 00:02:44,695
♪ One by one they all
just fade away ♪

68
00:02:48,059 --> 00:02:50,301
Annie, you've got to get me
into this sleep lab.

69
00:02:50,302 --> 00:02:52,537
I can't think of a better use
of my time here

70
00:02:52,538 --> 00:02:53,671
than being unconscious.

71
00:02:53,672 --> 00:02:55,256
It's not a blowoff class, Jeff.

72
00:02:55,257 --> 00:02:57,291
We're only allowed to bring
one stuffed animal.

73
00:02:57,292 --> 00:02:59,160
I'm bringing Ruthie...

74
00:02:59,161 --> 00:03:01,796
But using her pouch
to sneaking Nathan.

75
00:03:01,797 --> 00:03:03,804
Well, have fun.

76
00:03:06,001 --> 00:03:08,019
Wait, since when
do we have lockers?

77
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,855
Uh, since
registration day, 2009.

78
00:03:10,856 --> 00:03:12,506
Jeff, did you skip

79
00:03:12,507 --> 00:03:14,442
the Preorientation Freshman
Welcome Seminar

80
00:03:14,443 --> 00:03:16,510
and Diversity Fire Circle?

81
00:03:16,511 --> 00:03:18,396
This explains so much
about you.

82
00:03:18,397 --> 00:03:21,315
Are you saying I've had
a locker here for 21/2 years?

83
00:03:24,987 --> 00:03:27,521
Whoa, whoa.
Wow.

84
00:03:27,522 --> 00:03:29,907
"Halloween dance."
"Post-Halloween dance."

85
00:03:29,908 --> 00:03:31,159
"Dance contest."

86
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,710
"Contest dance."
Oh, come on.

87
00:03:32,711 --> 00:03:35,997
What's this? "Save Garrett"?
What's wrong with Garrett?

88
00:03:35,998 --> 00:03:39,884
Nothing now.
We saved him.

89
00:03:39,885 --> 00:03:40,885
Aah!

90
00:03:40,886 --> 00:03:43,004
Wait, that's "saved" Garrett?

91
00:03:43,005 --> 00:03:45,873
Ooh, what's this?
Love letter?

92
00:03:45,874 --> 00:03:48,059
Oh, it's probably one of many.

93
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,144
Oh, no.
This is a hate letter.

94
00:03:50,145 --> 00:03:51,545
What?
Let me see that.

95
00:03:51,546 --> 00:03:53,181
"Dear Jeff,
this might come as a shock

96
00:03:53,182 --> 00:03:55,149
"to someone who thinks
he's God's gift to the world,

97
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,151
"but you're actually
an inconsiderate jerk.

98
00:03:57,152 --> 00:03:58,219
Kim."

99
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,104
- "Inconsiderate"?
- Who's Kim?

100
00:04:00,105 --> 00:04:02,273
I don't know, and clearly
she doesn't know me.

101
00:04:02,274 --> 00:04:03,858
Gesundheit.

102
00:04:03,859 --> 00:04:04,859
I didn't sneeze.

103
00:04:08,664 --> 00:04:10,014
Look at these idiots.

104
00:04:10,015 --> 00:04:11,732
Cattle, sheep...

105
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:14,202
Other animals
that travel in herds.

106
00:04:14,203 --> 00:04:15,402
I want to say snakes.

107
00:04:15,403 --> 00:04:17,455
Am I the only person
enraged by the fact

108
00:04:17,456 --> 00:04:19,757
that corporations
are taking human form?

109
00:04:19,758 --> 00:04:22,793
I totally predicted this in
my High School newspaper column

110
00:04:22,794 --> 00:04:24,245
"Britta unfiltered."

111
00:04:24,246 --> 00:04:27,248
- Unfiltered. I get it.
- Get what?

112
00:04:27,249 --> 00:04:30,751
Actually, maybe Subway taking
human form could be its undoing.

113
00:04:30,752 --> 00:04:32,253
Uh, Britta...

114
00:04:32,254 --> 00:04:34,388
You're a, uh, progressive woman

115
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:38,693
of a more...
liberated looseness.

116
00:04:38,694 --> 00:04:41,062
You could get close to Subway
and find out some dirt on him.

117
00:04:41,063 --> 00:04:43,531
Corporate espionage.
I like it.

118
00:04:43,532 --> 00:04:46,984
Microphones hidden in lipstick.
Lipstick hidden in microphones.

119
00:04:46,985 --> 00:04:48,703
And the deadliest weapon
of them all...

120
00:04:48,704 --> 00:04:52,273
- The penis flytrap.
- Okay! This conversation is over.

121
00:04:52,274 --> 00:04:54,875
I am not a whore,
and not that I've done the math,

122
00:04:54,876 --> 00:04:57,161
but if I were,
I'd be the super classy kind

123
00:04:57,162 --> 00:05:00,248
that gets flown to Dubai to stay
in an underwater hotel.

124
00:05:04,503 --> 00:05:07,088
- Abed, Troy.
- Ah, don't worry, Dean.

125
00:05:07,089 --> 00:05:08,756
We have all the proper permits
right here.

126
00:05:08,757 --> 00:05:10,057
Oh, silly me!

127
00:05:10,058 --> 00:05:12,977
This is a coupon for 20% off
at bed bath & beyond.

128
00:05:12,978 --> 00:05:17,098
No need to bribe me, Troy.
Actually...

129
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:18,649
There's plenty more
where that came from.

130
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,102
Look, I was just googling
record lengths of stuff,

131
00:05:21,103 --> 00:05:23,521
and apparently there's
a guinness world record

132
00:05:23,522 --> 00:05:25,906
for the biggest pillow...
or blanket fort.

133
00:05:25,907 --> 00:05:28,075
So you boys...
you should go for it.

134
00:05:28,076 --> 00:05:30,668
Put this school on the map.

135
00:05:31,302 --> 00:05:33,107
We'd have a better chance
of setting the record

136
00:05:33,108 --> 00:05:35,714
if we made this a blanket fort,
you know, take less time.

137
00:05:35,751 --> 00:05:37,168
We wanted to make
a pillow fort.

138
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:39,253
I don't want to sacrifice
quality for square footage.

139
00:05:39,254 --> 00:05:41,372
We don't need a world record to
tell us we did something cool.

140
00:05:41,373 --> 00:05:42,656
But if we won,
we might meet that dude

141
00:05:42,657 --> 00:05:43,674
with the curly fingernails.

142
00:05:43,675 --> 00:05:45,176
Shridhar Chillal?
Not interested.

143
00:05:45,177 --> 00:05:49,847
I saw him on a talk show.
He came off as pretentious.

144
00:05:49,848 --> 00:05:52,166
- I'm going to go get a drink.
- Okay.

145
00:05:54,136 --> 00:05:56,387
- Troy Barnes.
- Vice Dean Laybourne.

146
00:05:56,388 --> 00:05:59,940
You have a beard...
And a ponytail.

147
00:05:59,941 --> 00:06:01,475
Going through some stuff
right now, Troy.

148
00:06:01,476 --> 00:06:03,294
Don't worry about it.

149
00:06:03,295 --> 00:06:05,062
Any chance you've given
a second thought to joining

150
00:06:05,063 --> 00:06:06,280
my air conditioning
repair school?

151
00:06:06,281 --> 00:06:07,682
Sorry.

152
00:06:07,683 --> 00:06:10,684
Kind of busy at the moment doing
some awesome work with Abed.

153
00:06:10,685 --> 00:06:13,104
Ah, yeah, Abed.

154
00:06:13,105 --> 00:06:15,790
You guys watch that television
show together, don't you?

155
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,325
Inspector Spacetime.

156
00:06:17,326 --> 00:06:18,525
Funny, Troy.

157
00:06:18,526 --> 00:06:20,361
You and Abed have
always reminded me

158
00:06:20,362 --> 00:06:22,696
of the inspector
and his trusty constable Reggie.

159
00:06:22,697 --> 00:06:23,964
Cool!

160
00:06:23,965 --> 00:06:26,167
The inspector, of course,
is smart, decisive,

161
00:06:26,168 --> 00:06:27,885
and Reggie is...

162
00:06:27,886 --> 00:06:30,371
Well, he's Reggie.

163
00:06:30,372 --> 00:06:32,923
Reggie is trained
in zero-gravity martial arts

164
00:06:32,924 --> 00:06:33,974
and has a whistle.

165
00:06:33,975 --> 00:06:35,226
Yeah.

166
00:06:35,227 --> 00:06:37,762
But he never really
gets to blow the whistle

167
00:06:37,763 --> 00:06:40,231
unless the inspector
says it's okay.

168
00:06:40,232 --> 00:06:43,717
Less of a friendship,
more of a self-centered nerd

169
00:06:43,718 --> 00:06:45,403
and his naive, obedient lapdog.

170
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:46,971
Well, I got a thing.

171
00:06:46,972 --> 00:06:50,274
You take care.

172
00:06:50,275 --> 00:06:52,726
Well, according to the office,
this is the locker

173
00:06:52,727 --> 00:06:56,414
of the only Kim I've had
any class with since 2009.

174
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:58,666
Wonder what you did
to make her so mad.

175
00:06:58,667 --> 00:07:01,786
Maybe the two of you made out,
and then you forgot about her.

176
00:07:01,787 --> 00:07:04,672
Annie, that's what
you think of me?

177
00:07:04,673 --> 00:07:06,173
I don't make out
with forgettable women.

178
00:07:06,174 --> 00:07:07,208
Can I help you?

179
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:09,176
We're looking for Kim McFadden.

180
00:07:09,177 --> 00:07:11,545
- This is her locker, right?
- Are you serious?

181
00:07:11,546 --> 00:07:14,298
She slipped a note into
my locker a couple years ago.

182
00:07:14,299 --> 00:07:15,582
I guess I pissed her off
somehow.

183
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:19,103
- I'm hoping to apologize.
- That might not be easy.

184
00:07:19,104 --> 00:07:21,422
Kim's no longer with us.

185
00:07:21,423 --> 00:07:24,358
- She died two weeks ago.
- What?

186
00:07:24,359 --> 00:07:26,277
Sorry to drop that
on you and run,

187
00:07:26,278 --> 00:07:27,945
but there's a rally
for Garrett.

188
00:07:27,946 --> 00:07:30,564
But we saved him.

189
00:07:30,565 --> 00:07:34,368
Did we?

190
00:07:37,122 --> 00:07:38,205
What do you recommend?

191
00:07:38,206 --> 00:07:40,207
What's it to you, meat pusher?

192
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:42,076
Sounds like you might be
a vegetarian.

193
00:07:42,077 --> 00:07:43,661
You should try
Subway's Veggie Delite.

194
00:07:43,662 --> 00:07:46,113
You should try reading
Orwell's 1984.

195
00:07:46,114 --> 00:07:47,882
I have.
It's a great book.

196
00:07:47,883 --> 00:07:49,316
It really awakened me
in High School.

197
00:07:49,317 --> 00:07:50,617
I think kids should be forced
to read it.

198
00:07:50,618 --> 00:07:53,604
Me too.
Anyway, you're living it.

199
00:07:53,605 --> 00:07:56,240
You're a human puppet with big
sandwich's hand up your ass.

200
00:07:56,241 --> 00:07:57,675
Is this what you dreamt
of being?

201
00:07:57,676 --> 00:08:00,978
Unfortunately I'm not allowed
to discuss my former life

202
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:02,430
or engage in any
nonplatonic relations,

203
00:08:02,431 --> 00:08:04,064
practice religion in public,

204
00:08:04,065 --> 00:08:06,467
or eat any nonfresh,
unhealthy food like that

205
00:08:06,468 --> 00:08:08,102
found anywhere outside Subway.

206
00:08:08,103 --> 00:08:09,537
Why are you getting all that?

207
00:08:09,538 --> 00:08:11,472
I wanted to stand next to you
for a moment.

208
00:08:11,473 --> 00:08:13,974
It was worth it.

209
00:08:13,975 --> 00:08:19,413
Like a good book by Orwell
or a Veggie Delite.

210
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:24,535
Is that you, Subway?

211
00:08:24,536 --> 00:08:26,337
My eyesight ain't
what it used to be.

212
00:08:26,338 --> 00:08:27,988
Eat these tater tots, Harry.

213
00:08:27,989 --> 00:08:30,758
For what it's worth, I think you
might see more than all of us.

214
00:08:33,828 --> 00:08:35,129
Did you see him smiling at you?

215
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,181
Top-notch whoresmanship,
Britta.

216
00:08:37,182 --> 00:08:39,617
- Pierce.
- Sorry. Whoreswomanship.

217
00:08:39,618 --> 00:08:41,302
Forgot it was the '90s.

218
00:08:41,303 --> 00:08:42,720
Uh-oh.

219
00:08:42,721 --> 00:08:44,722
Anyway...
Thank you, Britta.

220
00:08:44,723 --> 00:08:47,107
I knew we could count on you
to help us take him down!

221
00:08:47,108 --> 00:08:49,226
Yep, that's me, the girl
who's going to destroy

222
00:08:49,227 --> 00:08:51,862
the big sandwich company
with the dreamy eyes.

223
00:08:51,863 --> 00:08:54,798
Ooh!
We did it, Pierce.

224
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,074

225
00:09:10,912 --> 00:09:12,412
Powerful passage, isn't it?

226
00:09:13,016 --> 00:09:15,512
"She had become
a physical necessity."

227
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,192
You circled this paragraph.

228
00:09:18,248 --> 00:09:19,997
I can't say that I did.

229
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,973
I just think it's a striking
expression of love's ability

230
00:09:22,974 --> 00:09:26,493
to persevere within the cracks
and cogs of inhuman systems.

231
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:29,951
Who were you, Subway,
before you were Subway?

232
00:09:29,991 --> 00:09:31,109
I can't say.

233
00:09:31,502 --> 00:09:32,902
I have to live
within the rules.

234
00:09:32,903 --> 00:09:34,921
This identity is my life.

235
00:09:34,922 --> 00:09:36,706
If I do this
for three more years,

236
00:09:36,707 --> 00:09:37,874
I can live a real dream.

237
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,342
Well, at least tell me
what that is.

238
00:09:39,343 --> 00:09:42,412
I want to run a nonprofit
shelter for handicapped animals.

239
00:09:42,413 --> 00:09:44,414
Dogs with wheels for hind legs.

240
00:09:44,415 --> 00:09:46,438
- Deaf hamsters.
- One-eyed cats?

241
00:09:46,596 --> 00:09:49,127
Well, they weren't on the top
of my list, but sure.

242
00:09:49,882 --> 00:09:50,982
I should go.

243
00:09:51,038 --> 00:09:52,639
This is getting
out of bounds for me.

244
00:09:52,943 --> 00:09:54,460
Eat fresh.

245
00:09:57,194 --> 00:09:58,794
You should put the small ones
in the middle,

246
00:09:58,795 --> 00:09:59,987
or the wall won't hold
the ceiling.

247
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,659
Why do I always have
to be your Reggie?

248
00:10:02,043 --> 00:10:03,066
What?

249
00:10:03,067 --> 00:10:04,267
I wanted to make
a blanket fort,

250
00:10:04,268 --> 00:10:06,232
and you never even gave it
a second thought.

251
00:10:06,404 --> 00:10:08,321
I'm not even your sidekick.
I'm your underkick.

252
00:10:08,372 --> 00:10:10,112
I never said
you couldn't do anything.

253
00:10:10,374 --> 00:10:13,189
If you want to make a blanket
fort, that's fine with me.

254
00:10:13,327 --> 00:10:14,577
Thank you.

255
00:10:14,578 --> 00:10:17,869
Just don't make it
part of my pillow fort.

256
00:10:20,951 --> 00:10:22,836
Fine.

257
00:10:22,837 --> 00:10:24,287
I'll start it somewhere else.

258
00:10:24,288 --> 00:10:28,641
Have fun stacking pillows
like a baby.

259
00:10:28,642 --> 00:10:31,594
Jeff, are you okay?

260
00:10:31,595 --> 00:10:33,980
I'm lying on campus furniture,
so no.

261
00:10:33,981 --> 00:10:38,401
Is it about this Kim girl?

262
00:10:38,402 --> 00:10:41,704
She is someone who died
thinking I was a dick.

263
00:10:41,705 --> 00:10:43,473
I can never apologize.

264
00:10:43,474 --> 00:10:45,241
I can never change her mind.

265
00:10:45,242 --> 00:10:47,777
That makes me a dick forever.

266
00:10:47,778 --> 00:10:50,029
You think that's
what an apology is?

267
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:53,583
A spell you cast on another
person to make them forgive you?

268
00:10:53,584 --> 00:10:56,953
Apologies are opportunities
to admit your own mistakes.

269
00:10:56,954 --> 00:10:58,505
Apologize to her locker.

270
00:10:58,506 --> 00:11:01,424
But how can I apologize if
I don't know what I did wrong?

271
00:11:01,425 --> 00:11:05,378
Well, didn't she call you
inconsiderate?

272
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:09,716
Sounds to me like you know
exactly what you did wrong.

273
00:11:09,717 --> 00:11:12,852
- Leonard, what are you doing?
- Abed's fort needs pillows.

274
00:11:12,853 --> 00:11:14,437
But I was going to lie there.

275
00:11:14,438 --> 00:11:17,840
I was going to invest
in IBM in 1952,

276
00:11:17,841 --> 00:11:20,310
but life is full
of disappointments.

277
00:11:23,981 --> 00:11:25,865
Eating fresh, are we?

278
00:11:25,866 --> 00:11:28,351
Have you found any dirt
on Subway yet?

279
00:11:28,352 --> 00:11:30,620
No, nothing. I should
probably hang out with him more.

280
00:11:30,621 --> 00:11:33,456
You know what I think?
I think you're falling for him.

281
00:11:33,457 --> 00:11:35,792
I am not.
Who do you think I am?

282
00:11:35,793 --> 00:11:36,993
I lived in New York.

283
00:11:36,994 --> 00:11:39,028
You never lived anywhere.

284
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:40,814
You're a weapon
designed for sex.

285
00:11:40,815 --> 00:11:42,165
You only think
you lived in New York

286
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,666
'cause I implanted
your memories.

287
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:46,536
Oh, Pierce, stop it!
Look what we're becoming.

288
00:11:46,537 --> 00:11:48,555
I'm sorry we pulled you
into this dirty game.

289
00:11:48,556 --> 00:11:49,556
I want you to stop.

290
00:11:49,557 --> 00:11:51,040
Yeah, we're pulling you out...

291
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:53,593
Right after
your last assignment.

292
00:11:53,594 --> 00:11:56,513
This pen is a microphone.

293
00:11:56,514 --> 00:12:01,267
It's also a miniflask.

294
00:12:01,268 --> 00:12:02,902
Did you just drink ink?

295
00:12:02,903 --> 00:12:04,704
Just plant this on Subway,

296
00:12:04,705 --> 00:12:06,356
and you'll never have
to see him again.

297
00:12:06,357 --> 00:12:08,491
Until then,
keep him interested.

298
00:12:08,492 --> 00:12:12,078
And for God's sakes, slap
some life on those dead lips.

299
00:12:15,732 --> 00:12:18,785
Hello, Abed.
How's the pillow fort going?

300
00:12:18,786 --> 00:12:21,087
It's hard making something
perfect, but it's worth it.

301
00:12:21,088 --> 00:12:23,173
Yeah, I'll remember that
when I'm being given a key

302
00:12:23,174 --> 00:12:24,924
to the secret guinness
record holders' clubhouse,

303
00:12:24,925 --> 00:12:27,143
where I'll be hanging with those
two fat guys on motorcycles

304
00:12:27,144 --> 00:12:29,345
and being fitted
for a beard of bees.

305
00:12:29,346 --> 00:12:32,348
Whoo! Well, Troy, I just got
off the phone with Guinness,

306
00:12:32,349 --> 00:12:33,883
and they are sending
a representative

307
00:12:33,884 --> 00:12:36,686
to have a look-see
at your blanket fort.

308
00:12:36,687 --> 00:12:39,722
- Are we world-record ready?
- Garrett?

309
00:12:39,723 --> 00:12:42,725
We are still more than 2,000
square feet shy of the record.

310
00:12:42,726 --> 00:12:45,595
Abed's pillow fort is the only
thing standing in our way.

311
00:12:45,596 --> 00:12:47,430
Well, what are we going
to do here, guys?

312
00:12:47,431 --> 00:12:49,098
Is there a way
we can connect them?

313
00:12:49,099 --> 00:12:50,900
You can't connect the blanket
fort to the pillow fort

314
00:12:50,901 --> 00:12:52,068
and still call it
a pillow fort.

315
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:53,152
Even if you could,
I'd rather see

316
00:12:53,153 --> 00:12:54,537
my work destroyed
than compromise it.

317
00:12:54,538 --> 00:12:57,273
Great, Abed will destroy
his pillow fort,

318
00:12:57,274 --> 00:13:00,376
and Troy will expand
his blanket fort into the space.

319
00:13:00,377 --> 00:13:01,744
Everyone wins.

320
00:13:01,745 --> 00:13:04,964
Except Abed, but you know,
not everyone can win.

321
00:13:04,965 --> 00:13:06,749
Is that what you want, Troy?

322
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:10,570
For me to destroy my pillow fort
so you could set your record?

323
00:13:10,571 --> 00:13:13,323
- It is.
- Magnitude.

324
00:13:13,324 --> 00:13:16,249
Evacuate fort Abed,
and prepare for self-destruct.

325
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,128
- Sir?
- Do it. We're done here.

326
00:13:19,129 --> 00:13:22,965
Pop, pop, Captain.

327
00:13:30,741 --> 00:13:32,859
- Oh!
- Subway.

328
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,161
Britta, I was worried
you wouldn't come.

329
00:13:35,162 --> 00:13:39,165
- I can't stop thinking about you.
- Shh.

330
00:13:41,452 --> 00:13:43,086
They wanted me to plant
a bug on you.

331
00:13:43,087 --> 00:13:44,637
I can't, and I won't.

332
00:13:44,638 --> 00:13:47,957
Our values, our identities...
they mean nothing to me now.

333
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,459
Only the primal remains.

334
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:53,429
To me, you are simply
a physical necessity.

335
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:54,681
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

336
00:13:54,682 --> 00:13:57,300
Oh, Subway.

337
00:14:00,104 --> 00:14:01,971
Subway.

338
00:14:01,972 --> 00:14:04,440
- Oh, Subway.
- Mmm.

339
00:14:04,441 --> 00:14:06,776
Oh, Subway.

340
00:14:06,777 --> 00:14:07,777
Oh, no, no.

341
00:14:07,778 --> 00:14:09,104
No, this is wrong, Pierce.

342
00:14:09,105 --> 00:14:10,325
I just wanted to open
a sandwich shop.

343
00:14:10,347 --> 00:14:11,531
I did not sign up for this.

344
00:14:11,532 --> 00:14:13,316
You don't want to get
your hands dirty, fine.

345
00:14:13,317 --> 00:14:15,034
I will.

346
00:14:15,035 --> 00:14:19,530
Nice knowing you, Subway.
If that is your real name.

347
00:14:22,042 --> 00:14:25,044
Ahh.

348
00:14:33,653 --> 00:14:36,794
Kim.
It's me, Jeff.

349
00:14:37,401 --> 00:14:39,619
The inconsiderate jerk.

350
00:14:39,683 --> 00:14:41,550
Look, I don't remember
hurting you,

351
00:14:41,551 --> 00:14:44,036
and I have to assume
that's what hurt you.

352
00:14:44,037 --> 00:14:45,671
God knows what crime
you've committed

353
00:14:45,672 --> 00:14:48,023
to deserve me
disregarding you entirely.

354
00:14:48,024 --> 00:14:50,810
But whatever your crime,
I think we both know

355
00:14:50,811 --> 00:14:53,062
the real crime is mine.

356
00:14:53,063 --> 00:14:55,310
I'm a self-centered,
shallow jackass.

357
00:14:56,222 --> 00:15:00,382
And I just want to...
thank you for your note

358
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,706
because I'm going
to try and change.

359
00:15:03,707 --> 00:15:05,357
I just wish you were here
to forgive me.

360
00:15:05,358 --> 00:15:07,035
I am.

361
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:09,206
And I do.

362
00:15:09,477 --> 00:15:10,582
I'm Kim.

363
00:15:10,714 --> 00:15:11,747
What?

364
00:15:11,748 --> 00:15:13,632
You said Kim was dead.

365
00:15:13,633 --> 00:15:16,252
Because you never remember
who I am.

366
00:15:16,253 --> 00:15:18,170
First year, we hung out,
like, ten times.

367
00:15:18,171 --> 00:15:20,222
And each time,
you introduced yourself to me.

368
00:15:20,223 --> 00:15:21,757
That's why I wrote that note.

369
00:15:21,758 --> 00:15:24,042
And then today, it's like
you still don't remember me.

370
00:15:24,043 --> 00:15:26,312
And... and you still assume
from my name that I am a girl.

371
00:15:26,313 --> 00:15:28,931
I had no choice but to make up
that awesome story

372
00:15:28,932 --> 00:15:31,517
about a dead chick to hurt you
like you hurt me.

373
00:15:31,518 --> 00:15:35,654
I am so sorry...

374
00:15:35,655 --> 00:15:37,656
Kim.
Right?

375
00:15:37,657 --> 00:15:40,826
Do you know how long I've
waited to hear you say that?

376
00:15:42,662 --> 00:15:44,697
What the hell is this crap?

377
00:15:44,698 --> 00:15:46,582
Annie, this is Kim.

378
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:47,917
I think because he had
a girl's name,

379
00:15:47,918 --> 00:15:49,251
I never took him seriously.

380
00:15:49,252 --> 00:15:51,036
It happens literally
all the time,

381
00:15:51,037 --> 00:15:54,072
which is insane because 16%
of all people named Kim are men.

382
00:15:54,073 --> 00:15:56,842
- I'm sorry, buddy.
- Don't apologize to this guy.

383
00:15:56,843 --> 00:15:59,995
- You told me to apologize.
- To a dead girl's locker.

384
00:15:59,996 --> 00:16:03,549
I thought I was
representing the sisterhood.

385
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,750
Thought I was
teaching you a lesson

386
00:16:04,751 --> 00:16:06,886
about all the girls
you dominate

387
00:16:06,887 --> 00:16:08,270
and then ignore.

388
00:16:08,271 --> 00:16:11,640
Not to waste your energy
on some weird, cloying,

389
00:16:11,641 --> 00:16:14,426
hypersensitive stalker
with a girl's name.

390
00:16:14,427 --> 00:16:16,445
Hey!
You are really mean.

391
00:16:16,446 --> 00:16:18,894
Put it in a letter,
Jane Austen.

392
00:16:20,951 --> 00:16:24,937
Prepare to initiate
Protocol Omega.

393
00:16:24,938 --> 00:16:28,073
Good-bye, pillow fort.
You were a beautiful dream.

394
00:16:28,074 --> 00:16:31,443
More than a dream.
It's here.

395
00:16:31,444 --> 00:16:32,611
Who are you?

396
00:16:32,612 --> 00:16:34,163
Someone who understands
dedication

397
00:16:34,164 --> 00:16:37,115
to craftsmanship
in the face of mediocrity.

398
00:16:37,116 --> 00:16:39,802
This world is run
by the unremarkables.

399
00:16:39,803 --> 00:16:42,121
Don't do what you always do,
Abed.

400
00:16:42,122 --> 00:16:45,123
Don't corrupt the host
to pacify the parasites.

401
00:16:45,124 --> 00:16:46,208
Ask yourself...

402
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:49,778
"What if I stopped worrying
about their acceptance of me?"

403
00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:53,315
What if it fell
to the Reggies of the world

404
00:16:53,316 --> 00:16:57,419
to keep up with the inspectors
or perish?

405
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:01,540
Now please turn your head
while I crawl away.

406
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:05,110
I'm going through some stuff
right now.

407
00:17:05,111 --> 00:17:07,880
I'm very insecure.

408
00:17:09,649 --> 00:17:10,816
What's going on?

409
00:17:10,817 --> 00:17:12,735
I'll ask the questions here.

410
00:17:12,736 --> 00:17:15,621
You had sex with Subway,
and I recorded it.

411
00:17:15,622 --> 00:17:17,823
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

412
00:17:17,824 --> 00:17:20,459
- Mm-hmm.
- Hmm.

413
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,011
You know what, I'm going
to let this one slide.

414
00:17:22,012 --> 00:17:23,012
- What?
- What?

415
00:17:23,013 --> 00:17:24,013
I know we have
very strict rules

416
00:17:24,014 --> 00:17:25,514
against romantic entanglements

417
00:17:25,515 --> 00:17:28,684
with our corpohumanoids,
but at this point in time,

418
00:17:28,685 --> 00:17:31,020
we can't stop them
from having hearts.

419
00:17:31,021 --> 00:17:33,439
These two are clearly in love.

420
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,107
If they want
to express that love

421
00:17:35,108 --> 00:17:39,061
in a perfectly healthy way,
then... okay, hold on.

422
00:17:39,062 --> 00:17:41,297
Th... is this
what I think it is?

423
00:17:42,849 --> 00:17:44,967
That got unhealthy real quick.

424
00:17:44,968 --> 00:17:47,169
That... okay, that's...
yeah, that's weird.

425
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:49,371
That is well out
of the mainstream.

426
00:17:49,372 --> 00:17:50,656
You know,
I was raised in the...

427
00:17:50,657 --> 00:17:53,358
the Bay Area, but I...
I'm a father now.

428
00:17:55,194 --> 00:17:58,330
Subway cannot stand for that,
and frankly, Rick,

429
00:17:58,331 --> 00:18:00,866
- I-I'm surprised you did.
- My name is Subway.

430
00:18:00,867 --> 00:18:02,534
Not anymore.

431
00:18:02,535 --> 00:18:04,503
- The bread is stale.
- No! No!

432
00:18:04,504 --> 00:18:07,006
- Oh, my God.
- Subway, I love you!

433
00:18:07,007 --> 00:18:08,173
- Britta!
- Shut up.

434
00:18:08,174 --> 00:18:09,675
How could you?

435
00:18:09,676 --> 00:18:13,596
Well, if that'll be all,
I'll be on my way.

436
00:18:13,597 --> 00:18:16,815
If someone could
hand me my jacket.

437
00:18:16,816 --> 00:18:19,234
It's right over there on
the coatrack next to the door.

438
00:18:19,235 --> 00:18:22,204
If somebody could just hand it
to me, that would be great.

439
00:18:25,442 --> 00:18:26,892
I guess I'm confused.

440
00:18:26,893 --> 00:18:28,560
Why don't you just grab it
on your way out the door...

441
00:18:28,561 --> 00:18:30,446
You know what?
Now I'm not leaving.

442
00:18:30,447 --> 00:18:32,531
Now I'm just going
to sit for a while

443
00:18:32,532 --> 00:18:36,251
and focus on how unacceptable
today was.

444
00:18:36,252 --> 00:18:38,754
Jeff.

445
00:18:38,755 --> 00:18:40,956
I wanted to apologize.

446
00:18:40,957 --> 00:18:44,743
I never realized I had my own
issues regarding gender roles,

447
00:18:44,744 --> 00:18:47,680
and it was certainly unfair
of me to take them out on Kim.

448
00:18:47,681 --> 00:18:49,264
Mm.

449
00:18:49,265 --> 00:18:51,917
Who's Kim?

450
00:18:51,918 --> 00:18:54,803
Corporate America
has destroyed love.

451
00:18:54,804 --> 00:18:58,107
- Again?
- Subway!

452
00:18:58,108 --> 00:19:01,259
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought
you were someone else.

453
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,096
Britta, you silly.
It is me, Subway.

454
00:19:04,097 --> 00:19:05,564
What?

455
00:19:05,565 --> 00:19:07,783
I had a great time with you
last night in the pillow fort,

456
00:19:07,784 --> 00:19:10,369
the one exception being
the deviant sex act

457
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:13,317
you initiated
without my consent.

458
00:19:15,542 --> 00:19:18,110
Eat fresh.

459
00:19:18,111 --> 00:19:19,111
Aah!

460
00:19:19,112 --> 00:19:20,445
- Whoa!
- Oh, jeez.

461
00:19:20,446 --> 00:19:22,781
There is a situation
developing in the study room.

462
00:19:22,782 --> 00:19:24,667
I would elaborate,
but I am out of breath

463
00:19:24,668 --> 00:19:26,468
because I walked here
very briskly.

464
00:19:29,455 --> 00:19:31,590
Calm down!

465
00:19:31,591 --> 00:19:35,427
Calm! Down!

466
00:19:35,428 --> 00:19:38,130
- What's going on here?
- Abed won't tear down his fort.

467
00:19:38,131 --> 00:19:39,965
I shouldn't have to compromise
my craftsmanship

468
00:19:39,966 --> 00:19:41,900
- to placate mediocrity.
- Mediocrity?

469
00:19:41,901 --> 00:19:43,902
Okay, b...
boys, boys.

470
00:19:43,903 --> 00:19:46,238
The Guinness rep will be here
in two days.

471
00:19:46,239 --> 00:19:49,474
Can we just flip a coin
to decide who has to back down?

472
00:19:49,475 --> 00:19:50,776
- No.
- No.

473
00:19:50,777 --> 00:19:53,311
Well, I'm Dean,
so I'm making the call.

474
00:19:55,665 --> 00:19:57,583
The pillow fort comes down.

475
00:19:57,584 --> 00:19:59,918
- All right, you stay back.
- Watch it, Star-Burns.

476
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,920
My name is Alex!

477
00:20:07,927 --> 00:20:09,995
This is war!

478
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:27,846
- Back, back.
- Back.

479
00:20:27,847 --> 00:20:30,482
- Go.
- Back, back, back in the fort.

480
00:20:32,518 --> 00:20:35,504
To be continued.

481
00:20:43,608 --> 00:20:45,743
Sir, it appears that
Troy Barnes' blanket fort

482
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,095
may go to war with Abed Nadir's
pillow fort.

483
00:20:48,096 --> 00:20:49,247
Of course.

484
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,832
Soon Troy and Abed
will be torn asunder,

485
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:55,636
and an unencumbered Troy
will turn to his destiny...

486
00:20:55,637 --> 00:20:58,005
The air conditioning
repair school.

487
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,096
You are a cold-blooded man,
sir.

488
00:21:00,148 --> 00:21:01,426
Yes.

489
00:21:01,842 --> 00:21:05,156
How unfortunate
for Troy and Abed.

490
00:21:08,118 --> 00:21:10,092
See you in band practice.

490
