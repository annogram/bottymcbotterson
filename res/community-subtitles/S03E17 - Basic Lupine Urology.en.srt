1
00:00:01,774 --> 00:00:04,908
Greendale Community College
is represented by two separate,

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:07,028
yet equally important
types of people:

3
00:00:07,029 --> 00:00:09,477
The goofballs that run around
stirring up trouble,

4
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:12,266
and the eggheads that
make a big deal out of it.

5
00:00:12,366 --> 00:00:14,218
These are their stories.

6
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:15,422
You'll be better off
without her.

7
00:00:15,446 --> 00:00:18,198
She was perfect.
Warm, smart, beautiful.

8
00:00:18,229 --> 00:00:21,285
I'm never gonna find another
dental hygienist like that.

9
00:00:21,426 --> 00:00:22,653
Well, you should
stop hitting on her.

10
00:00:22,691 --> 00:00:25,793
Hey, she's the one putting
her hands in my mouth.

11
00:00:25,998 --> 00:00:26,998
Hey!

12
00:00:26,999 --> 00:00:28,978
Over here.

13
00:00:31,537 --> 00:00:33,705
Move along,
nothing to see here.

14
00:00:33,706 --> 00:00:35,673
That's the first time those
words have actually been true.

15
00:00:35,674 --> 00:00:37,468
Ms. Edison, when you called me
down here at midnight,

16
00:00:37,507 --> 00:00:39,184
I expected more than a yam.

17
00:00:39,229 --> 00:00:41,050
Specifically since you said,
"There's been a murder."

18
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:42,274
Our yam was murdered.

19
00:00:42,318 --> 00:00:43,981
If it's any consolation,
she got me here

20
00:00:44,021 --> 00:00:45,605
on a very misleading
text message.

21
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,288
Jeff, technically,
you are about to be screwed

22
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:48,800
in the biology room
because our final project

23
00:00:48,825 --> 00:00:49,776
has been destroyed.

24
00:00:49,805 --> 00:00:51,589
All right, look,
I'm sorry for your loss.

25
00:00:51,605 --> 00:00:54,205
I know you guys put the work in,
so you'll get a passing grade.

26
00:00:54,276 --> 00:00:55,526
A passing grade?

27
00:00:55,527 --> 00:00:56,944
Like a "C"?

28
00:00:56,945 --> 00:00:59,230
Why don't I just get pregnant
at a bus station?

29
00:00:59,231 --> 00:01:01,348
That was going to be
an A-plus yam.

30
00:01:01,349 --> 00:01:03,017
I can't give an A-plus
to everyone

31
00:01:03,018 --> 00:01:04,685
whose yam falls of a counter.

32
00:01:04,686 --> 00:01:06,537
Somebody did this to us.

33
00:01:06,538 --> 00:01:08,790
In science,
we call that a hypothesis.

34
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:11,159
You find something
to back it up and we can talk.

35
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,715
<i>Now if you'll excuse me,
I was watching Mama's Family.</i>

36
00:01:15,224 --> 00:01:16,483
What happened?

37
00:01:16,503 --> 00:01:17,584
Our yam was killed.

38
00:01:17,623 --> 00:01:19,139
But Professor Kane says
we can still get an "A"

39
00:01:19,201 --> 00:01:20,948
- if we figure out who did it.
- He did not say that.

40
00:01:20,976 --> 00:01:21,896
He basically did.

41
00:01:21,912 --> 00:01:23,357
You let me handle
the nitty gritty.

42
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,408
I watch crime shows
when I'm bored.

43
00:01:28,518 --> 00:01:30,552
You boys, canvas for witnesses,
establish a time frame

44
00:01:30,584 --> 00:01:32,135
and motive and bring
me a suspect.

45
00:01:32,168 --> 00:01:33,856
You've got 48 hours before
the trail runs cold,

46
00:01:33,871 --> 00:01:35,488
so start with the last person
to see that yam alive.

47
00:01:35,535 --> 00:01:38,070
- Yes, ma'am.
- Understood.

48
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,887
It's been a long 15 years.

49
00:01:39,888 --> 00:01:42,407
Looks like it's gonna
be a late night.

50
00:01:42,408 --> 00:01:43,741
How'd we manage
to pull the short straw?

51
00:01:43,742 --> 00:01:45,359
It's not a short straw.

52
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,412
It's a hot potato.

53
00:01:47,413 --> 00:01:51,499
Yeah, well,
looks pretty cold to me.

54
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,069
Cold?
Or dead?

55
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,755
- Survey says...
- We can't both do the zinger.

56
00:01:57,756 --> 00:01:59,240
Sorry.

59
00:02:35,808 --> 00:02:39,878
Okay, okay, five-to-one
on the black guy.

60
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:40,879
That's offensive.

61
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,880
Fine, six-to-one.

62
00:02:41,881 --> 00:02:42,881
Hello, boys.

63
00:02:42,882 --> 00:02:45,765
Youth! Scatter!

64
00:02:45,842 --> 00:02:48,944
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
slow down, Pierce.

65
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:50,813
Mind if we ask you
a couple of questions?

66
00:02:50,873 --> 00:02:53,235
Sure, I always say you guys
should ask me more questions.

67
00:02:53,309 --> 00:02:54,976
Did you water our
biology yam last night?

68
00:02:54,977 --> 00:02:56,144
Of course I watered it.

69
00:02:56,145 --> 00:02:57,378
It was my turn, wasn't it?

70
00:02:57,379 --> 00:02:58,680
I hold up my end.

71
00:02:58,681 --> 00:03:01,251
Did you hold it or drop it?

72
00:03:01,298 --> 00:03:03,466
Okay, whoa, I had
nothing to do with that.

73
00:03:03,686 --> 00:03:05,282
I-I couldn't even
get in the room.

74
00:03:05,315 --> 00:03:06,378
Make up your mind, Pierce.

75
00:03:06,402 --> 00:03:08,137
Did you water the yam
or weren't you there?

76
00:03:08,365 --> 00:03:10,707
Okay, I lied about watering it.

77
00:03:10,735 --> 00:03:12,719
I got there too late,
the doors were already locked.

78
00:03:12,752 --> 00:03:14,321
Why were you late?

79
00:03:14,438 --> 00:03:16,940
I... fell asleep
in a sunbeam.

80
00:03:17,003 --> 00:03:18,503
- Likely story.
- Actually it is.

81
00:03:18,567 --> 00:03:20,035
I used to live with him,
it's kind of adorable.

82
00:03:20,036 --> 00:03:21,753
Look, why are you
looking at me for this?

83
00:03:21,754 --> 00:03:23,672
It was my yam too.

84
00:03:23,673 --> 00:03:24,790
You should be talking
to somebody

85
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:25,791
who would wanna hurt us.

86
00:03:25,792 --> 00:03:27,592
- And who's that?
- Duh-doy!

87
00:03:27,593 --> 00:03:28,770
Todd.

88
00:03:30,546 --> 00:03:32,964
Last night,
I was home by 9:15,

89
00:03:32,965 --> 00:03:35,550
helped Elly with her geography
and then went straight to bed.

90
00:03:35,551 --> 00:03:37,436
Sounds like you keep
a pretty tight schedule.

91
00:03:37,437 --> 00:03:39,938
A valuable side effect
of military service.

92
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:43,525
In Iraq, keeping
a tight schedule saved lives.

93
00:03:43,526 --> 00:03:45,026
Ah, what happened, Todd?

94
00:03:45,027 --> 00:03:47,145
Cut yourself on an extra sharp
Oscar Wilde play?

95
00:03:47,146 --> 00:03:48,280
Oh, this?
It's a burn.

96
00:03:48,281 --> 00:03:49,948
Home ec class. Muffin.

97
00:03:49,949 --> 00:03:50,982
What kind of muffin?

98
00:03:50,983 --> 00:03:52,267
- Blueberry.
- Why not raisin?

99
00:03:52,268 --> 00:03:53,674
That wasn't the assignment.

100
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:54,982
You can dance all day, Todd,

101
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,417
but sooner or later,
the music's gonna change.

102
00:03:56,622 --> 00:04:00,132
Look, even if I wanted to hurt
your yam, I couldn't.

103
00:04:00,196 --> 00:04:02,931
I went by the bio room at 8:10
to chart my yam's growth.

104
00:04:03,112 --> 00:04:04,445
The door was already locked.

105
00:04:04,446 --> 00:04:05,630
There's a lot
of that going around.

106
00:04:05,631 --> 00:04:07,215
- Oh, yeah.
- It's true.

107
00:04:07,216 --> 00:04:09,584
I had to take a picture of my
yam through the door.

108
00:04:09,585 --> 00:04:10,635
See?

109
00:04:10,636 --> 00:04:13,505
Your yam was fine when I left.

110
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,291
I transferred or "downloaded"

111
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,127
Todd's photograph
to this computer

112
00:04:19,128 --> 00:04:21,646
and as you'll see, with
a few adjustments, I can make

113
00:04:21,647 --> 00:04:24,483
the entire image...

114
00:04:24,484 --> 00:04:27,903
old west color.

115
00:04:27,904 --> 00:04:29,354
I don't know.
I thought it was cool.

116
00:04:29,355 --> 00:04:30,822
Britta, zoom in there.

117
00:04:30,823 --> 00:04:32,574
There's a clock on the wall.

118
00:04:32,575 --> 00:04:34,943
- Eight plus two times five...
- Ten after 8:00.

119
00:04:34,944 --> 00:04:36,477
I'm gifted in other ways.

120
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:38,113
That jibes with everyone
else we talked to.

121
00:04:38,114 --> 00:04:39,948
It seems like the classroom door
gets locked at 8:00.

122
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:41,283
Which means whoever
did the crime...

123
00:04:41,284 --> 00:04:42,834
Got in there before
the doors were locked

124
00:04:42,835 --> 00:04:44,381
and stayed there for hours.

125
00:04:44,402 --> 00:04:45,615
I was gonna say, "Had a key".

126
00:04:45,626 --> 00:04:47,527
Last year, I came in
after hours a couple of times

127
00:04:47,543 --> 00:04:49,642
to finish a piÃ±ata
for advanced Spanish.

128
00:04:49,676 --> 00:04:51,744
I had to borrow a key
from the front office.

129
00:04:51,807 --> 00:04:53,284
And sign a log.

130
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:54,534
I can also help.

131
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,214
As a psych major, I could pr...

132
00:04:57,698 --> 00:04:59,580
Any student can check out
a key as long as they're

133
00:04:59,608 --> 00:05:01,942
currently taking classes
and show school I.D.

134
00:05:02,013 --> 00:05:03,344
The guy we're looking
for had a key

135
00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:04,606
to the bio room Monday night.

136
00:05:04,607 --> 00:05:06,841
Monday night?
Rings a bell.

137
00:05:06,842 --> 00:05:08,727
I'll check the log.

138
00:05:08,728 --> 00:05:11,179
Sorry, this place is a mess.

139
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,781
Is this about your yam?

140
00:05:12,782 --> 00:05:15,183
I heard about that.
It's a damn shame.

141
00:05:15,184 --> 00:05:19,070
- Mine just bloomed yesterday.
- Congratulations.

142
00:05:19,071 --> 00:05:23,491
Ooh, there she is.

143
00:05:23,492 --> 00:05:28,964
Monday night, one biology room
key checked out by...

144
00:05:29,136 --> 00:05:31,137
Magnitude.

145
00:05:32,935 --> 00:05:34,252
So you're saying you
did check out a key,

146
00:05:34,253 --> 00:05:36,087
but it was inside your backpack
when someone stole it

147
00:05:36,088 --> 00:05:38,306
off a table in the library while
you were using the bathroom

148
00:05:38,307 --> 00:05:39,674
and you haven't seen it since.

149
00:05:39,675 --> 00:05:43,211
Pop pop!

150
00:05:43,212 --> 00:05:45,380
Perfect, so now we gotta solve
a robbery too.

151
00:05:45,381 --> 00:05:46,982
Well, whoever did it
likes to steal backpacks

152
00:05:46,983 --> 00:05:48,183
off tables in the library.

153
00:05:48,184 --> 00:05:50,986
Only one way to catch
a dirtbag like that.

154
00:05:55,775 --> 00:05:58,777
Well, time to visit
the restroom.

155
00:06:20,249 --> 00:06:22,583
I found that backpack.

156
00:06:22,584 --> 00:06:25,586
Hey, idiot, guess what.

157
00:06:25,587 --> 00:06:28,223
We don't care about
the backpack.

158
00:06:28,224 --> 00:06:31,192
Dead yam, big deal.

159
00:06:31,193 --> 00:06:32,593
Order some ketchup.

160
00:06:32,594 --> 00:06:34,279
That doesn't make sense.
You don't order ketchup.

161
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,280
It's a condiment!

162
00:06:35,281 --> 00:06:36,764
Troy, Troy, hey, walk it off!

163
00:06:36,765 --> 00:06:38,650
Troy, walk it off!

164
00:06:38,651 --> 00:06:39,818
Sorry, my friend,
he's a bad cop.

165
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:41,069
- Yeah.
- I'm a good cop.

166
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,287
- Oh, good.
- You can trust me.

167
00:06:42,288 --> 00:06:44,289
Okay, well... hey!

168
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,824
I'm not falling for that.

169
00:06:45,825 --> 00:06:47,792
And you got nothing on me.

170
00:06:47,793 --> 00:06:50,078
And I don't have to stay here,
'cause you're not cops.

171
00:06:54,967 --> 00:06:56,635
He's right.
You're not cops.

172
00:06:56,636 --> 00:06:58,887
I'd say our hands are tied,
but we basically have no hands.

173
00:06:58,888 --> 00:07:00,088
But he's our man though, right?

174
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:02,057
Well he ain't innocent.

175
00:07:02,058 --> 00:07:03,842
Look, I'll try
to keep him busy.

176
00:07:03,843 --> 00:07:05,898
You guys go to the lab,
see if they figured out

177
00:07:05,934 --> 00:07:07,518
how our yam met its masher.

178
00:07:07,644 --> 00:07:10,312
I can both see and hear you.

179
00:07:11,942 --> 00:07:14,694
The yam's vascular cylinder
is completely disintegrated.

180
00:07:15,022 --> 00:07:16,656
Any possibility
it happened naturally?

181
00:07:16,719 --> 00:07:18,922
Sure, if the gardener's
Joseph Mengele.

182
00:07:18,991 --> 00:07:20,075
Look at the root system.

183
00:07:20,076 --> 00:07:21,993
This level of smushing
is consistent

184
00:07:21,994 --> 00:07:24,645
with someone stepping on the yam
after it was dropped.

185
00:07:24,646 --> 00:07:26,314
So whoever did this was angry.

186
00:07:26,315 --> 00:07:27,482
Hey, I just cut 'em open.

187
00:07:27,483 --> 00:07:29,150
You want motive,
talk to a shrink.

188
00:07:29,151 --> 00:07:32,871
What I can tell you is that for
a raw yam to get it this bad,

189
00:07:32,872 --> 00:07:34,822
you need more than gravity.

190
00:07:34,823 --> 00:07:36,124
You need a boot.

191
00:07:39,452 --> 00:07:40,842
We have to tell Professor Kane.

192
00:07:40,871 --> 00:07:42,321
There's nothing here
to connect to Star-Burns.

193
00:07:42,348 --> 00:07:43,348
He'd have to confess.

194
00:07:43,349 --> 00:07:44,349
Oh, yeah, sure.

195
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,467
Maybe if we ask him nice,

196
00:07:45,468 --> 00:07:46,768
he'll write us
a love letter too.

197
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:50,505
Well, whoever did do this does
owe you guys a letter.

198
00:07:50,506 --> 00:07:52,507
An "A."

199
00:07:54,443 --> 00:07:58,179
This yam was about to bloom.

200
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,531
Damn.

201
00:07:59,532 --> 00:08:03,151
We named the yam "Pam."

202
00:08:03,464 --> 00:08:04,824
It rhymed.

203
00:08:06,932 --> 00:08:08,019
Even if we could prove

204
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,520
that Star-Burns stole
Magnitude's key,

205
00:08:09,521 --> 00:08:10,521
it's not enough.

206
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,905
But we know Star-Burns
did it.

207
00:08:12,015 --> 00:08:13,594
Keep the change, Garret.

208
00:08:13,859 --> 00:08:15,236
You know what?
Keep the hot dog.

209
00:08:15,269 --> 00:08:16,287
You're telling me
after all this,

210
00:08:16,311 --> 00:08:17,561
our suspect's gonna slip away

211
00:08:17,601 --> 00:08:18,934
on the technicality
that we're not police?

212
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:20,889
Okay, look,
you don't need authority

213
00:08:20,912 --> 00:08:21,928
to get a confession.

214
00:08:21,943 --> 00:08:23,839
You need leverage.
Something to hold over his head.

215
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,175
- Like what?
- He's Star-Burns.

216
00:08:25,195 --> 00:08:26,174
Break into his locker.

217
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,484
You'll find enough dirt
to bury him.

218
00:08:27,501 --> 00:08:29,252
Jeff, that's not ethical.

219
00:08:29,472 --> 00:08:32,019
Oh, so now you're
finding your softness?

220
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,244
I say do what you have to do.

221
00:08:33,245 --> 00:08:34,611
It's too late
to get compassionate.

222
00:08:34,612 --> 00:08:37,414
We only have time
to get justice.

223
00:08:37,415 --> 00:08:39,083
I really shouldn't
be doing this.

224
00:08:39,084 --> 00:08:41,135
And you're sure you heard
a kitten meowing in here?

225
00:08:41,136 --> 00:08:43,671
Not anymore, so hurry up.

226
00:08:44,723 --> 00:08:46,724
Whoa, Nelly!

227
00:08:50,812 --> 00:08:53,814
Clean up on aisle "busted."

228
00:08:56,902 --> 00:08:58,435
Why do they always r...

229
00:08:58,436 --> 00:08:59,436
Why do they always...

230
00:08:59,437 --> 00:09:00,771
- You go ahead.
- Why do they always run?

231
00:09:00,772 --> 00:09:03,974
There you go.

232
00:09:03,975 --> 00:09:04,992
Move!

233
00:09:04,993 --> 00:09:06,827
Not police business!

234
00:09:06,828 --> 00:09:10,314
Hey, knock much?

235
00:09:10,315 --> 00:09:11,315
- Kiss me!
- What?

236
00:09:11,316 --> 00:09:12,316
I'll explain later.

237
00:09:12,317 --> 00:09:13,483
- No.
- I'll explain later.

238
00:09:13,484 --> 00:09:15,169
The explanation
isn't the issue.

239
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:16,820
Aah!

240
00:09:16,821 --> 00:09:18,455
Oh, all right, all right.

241
00:09:18,456 --> 00:09:21,625
Look, I-I swiped some
beakers for the meth lab

242
00:09:21,626 --> 00:09:23,627
that I'm building
in the trunk of my car.

243
00:09:23,628 --> 00:09:25,012
But that's it.

244
00:09:25,013 --> 00:09:26,597
I didn't kill any yam.

245
00:09:26,598 --> 00:09:28,015
Tell it
to the biology Professor.

246
00:09:28,016 --> 00:09:29,216
Oh, now wait!

247
00:09:29,217 --> 00:09:30,551
I know who did it.

248
00:09:30,552 --> 00:09:32,669
I left the door open
and someone came in.

249
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,355
He dropped your yam.

250
00:09:34,356 --> 00:09:36,173
Will you tell
our teacher who it was?

251
00:09:36,174 --> 00:09:37,641
If you promise
I won't get in trouble

252
00:09:37,642 --> 00:09:39,193
for stealing that
meth lab stuff.

253
00:09:39,194 --> 00:09:40,677
- Sure, whatever.
- Fine.

254
00:09:40,678 --> 00:09:42,679
Pinky swear?

255
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,017
It was the guy with
the weird head.

256
00:09:47,018 --> 00:09:48,035
The army guy.

257
00:09:48,036 --> 00:09:49,370
I heard the jar break and then

258
00:09:49,371 --> 00:09:52,039
I saw him running out
of the room holding his hand.

259
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:57,044
Looked like he cut himself.

260
00:09:57,045 --> 00:09:59,246
Well, well, well.

261
00:09:59,247 --> 00:10:00,297
Look at this, Abed.

262
00:10:00,298 --> 00:10:02,366
He weaves baskets and lies.

263
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,367
What's this about?

264
00:10:03,368 --> 00:10:05,369
It's about the killing
of our biology yam.

265
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:06,554
Will you please come with us?

266
00:10:06,555 --> 00:10:08,005
But I'm in the middle
of making a handle.

267
00:10:08,006 --> 00:10:10,207
He wants it the hard way.
Tell him what Shirley said.

268
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,376
Todd Jacobson, you have the
right to do whatever you want.

269
00:10:12,377 --> 00:10:14,878
Nothing you say or do can be
used against you by anyone,

270
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:16,347
but we'd really like it
if you came with us.

271
00:10:16,348 --> 00:10:18,449
Please and thank you.

272
00:10:19,534 --> 00:10:20,534
Make it quick, folks.

273
00:10:20,535 --> 00:10:23,220
I have a class in five minutes
and none of you guys are in it.

274
00:10:23,221 --> 00:10:25,389
After conducting
a full investigation,

275
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:28,492
my study group now has
definitive proof that Todd,

276
00:10:28,493 --> 00:10:31,111
with malice of forethought,
smashed our yam.

277
00:10:31,112 --> 00:10:33,497
That's a serious allegation.
I hope you can back it up.

278
00:10:33,498 --> 00:10:35,232
We can place him
in the building Monday night.

279
00:10:35,233 --> 00:10:37,868
He has a mysterious
bandage on his hand,

280
00:10:37,869 --> 00:10:40,070
and we have and eyewitness who
saw Todd drop the jar and flee.

281
00:10:40,071 --> 00:10:41,571
Well, Todd, what do you
have to say?

282
00:10:41,572 --> 00:10:44,792
- I just wanna...
- Don't answer that, soldier!

283
00:10:44,793 --> 00:10:47,344
- This man is an American hero.
- And who are you?

284
00:10:47,345 --> 00:10:50,047
I'm Lieutenant Colonel Archwood,
United States Army.

285
00:10:50,048 --> 00:10:52,582
I had the pleasure of commanding
this young man in Iraq.

286
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:53,968
I'm staying on his couch
this weekend

287
00:10:53,969 --> 00:10:55,469
while I'm in town
for a wedding.

288
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:58,555
I am a licensed attorney,
a veteran of two wars,

289
00:10:58,556 --> 00:11:02,776
and I'd like to know why in hell
he's being harassed.

290
00:11:02,777 --> 00:11:05,095
Mr. Winger,
what is the intention here?

291
00:11:05,096 --> 00:11:08,565
Simple. When Todd smashed our
yam, he stole an "A" from us.

292
00:11:08,566 --> 00:11:09,700
We want it back.

293
00:11:09,701 --> 00:11:11,652
<i>You mean if he smashed the yam.</i>

294
00:11:11,653 --> 00:11:13,954
All you have is the word
of this Mr. Star-Burns,

295
00:11:13,955 --> 00:11:16,740
who offers up no explanation
as to why he was at the scene.

296
00:11:16,741 --> 00:11:17,941
How about it, Jeffrey?

297
00:11:17,942 --> 00:11:20,110
What was Star-Burns
doing there?

298
00:11:20,111 --> 00:11:21,495
We agreed to withhold
that information

299
00:11:21,496 --> 00:11:23,947
as part of a pinky swear
with the witness.

300
00:11:23,948 --> 00:11:25,299
A pinky swear?

301
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,002
This is ludicrous.
This whole school is ludicrous.

302
00:11:28,003 --> 00:11:30,287
Who honors the pinky swear
of a degenerate

303
00:11:30,288 --> 00:11:31,839
over the word
of a decorated soldier?

304
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,475
I'm inclined to agree
with the man in uniform.

305
00:11:34,476 --> 00:11:36,010
- Shocker.
- Jeffrey.

306
00:11:36,011 --> 00:11:38,979
Tell us what Star-Burns
was doing in that classroom,

307
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,131
or your group can take an "F."

308
00:11:41,132 --> 00:11:42,799
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

309
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,435
I grade my students.

310
00:11:44,436 --> 00:11:46,770
Now, what Star-Face was doing
there is irrelevant.

311
00:11:46,771 --> 00:11:48,605
What matters is what he saw.

312
00:11:48,606 --> 00:11:50,107
I'm upholding the pinky swear.

313
00:11:50,108 --> 00:11:51,308
What?

314
00:11:51,309 --> 00:11:53,577
Yo, man, you spent
your life in the army.

315
00:11:53,578 --> 00:11:55,195
I spent mine in prison.

316
00:11:55,196 --> 00:11:58,582
Two places where a man's word
is only as good as his uniform.

317
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,751
Now out here,
it's supposed to be different.

318
00:12:00,752 --> 00:12:03,170
And in my class, it will be.

319
00:12:03,171 --> 00:12:04,755
You two can plead
your case to the class

320
00:12:04,756 --> 00:12:08,092
and let them
decide your grades.

321
00:12:08,491 --> 00:12:11,276
Professor...
Thank you.

322
00:12:11,496 --> 00:12:13,439
It's not a favor,
Mr. Winger.

323
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,061
A man's gotta have a code.

324
00:12:15,213 --> 00:12:16,997
Awesome.

325
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:19,421
See you in class.

326
00:12:23,141 --> 00:12:24,558
- Uniform.
- Oh!

327
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:25,559
Jeez.

328
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,561
Yeah.

329
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,294
Shirley did some more digging.

330
00:12:29,365 --> 00:12:31,327
Turns out Todd's yam
never even sprouted.

331
00:12:31,494 --> 00:12:32,811
Goes to motive.

332
00:12:32,858 --> 00:12:35,726
And Star-Burns puts Todd
in the classroom at 8:10.

333
00:12:35,767 --> 00:12:36,597
Opportunity.

334
00:12:36,619 --> 00:12:37,788
Add to that a cut on the hand

335
00:12:37,828 --> 00:12:40,696
and the Winger charm,
we might get an A-plus-plus.

336
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,040
We still have
a lot of work to do.

337
00:12:42,103 --> 00:12:43,422
Oh, I think you've done enough.

338
00:12:43,478 --> 00:12:45,262
Colonel Archwood
got to Star-Burns.

339
00:12:45,302 --> 00:12:46,803
Threatened to involve
the real cops.

340
00:12:47,046 --> 00:12:49,096
Now Star-Burns is in the wind.

341
00:12:49,504 --> 00:12:51,105
He's our only witness.

342
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:52,138
That what you guys do in here?

343
00:12:52,177 --> 00:12:53,177
You push your little papers

344
00:12:53,217 --> 00:12:54,397
and you make your
little speeches,

345
00:12:54,443 --> 00:12:56,295
and in the end another
dirtbag walks?

346
00:12:56,365 --> 00:12:58,123
Huh?
Huh?!

347
00:12:58,176 --> 00:13:00,310
Abed! Abed!

348
00:13:00,311 --> 00:13:02,212
Abed! Walk it off!

349
00:13:02,213 --> 00:13:04,815
Walk it off!

350
00:13:05,925 --> 00:13:07,709
I'm sorry about my partner.

351
00:13:07,952 --> 00:13:11,805
He... he's been on edge
ever since we switched.

352
00:13:12,223 --> 00:13:14,408
You.

353
00:13:14,722 --> 00:13:17,039
Annie, that class
already hates us.

354
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,142
If we go in there without
a case, they'll fail us.

355
00:13:19,143 --> 00:13:20,810
We have proof
our yam was murdered

356
00:13:20,811 --> 00:13:22,562
and now you find your softness?

357
00:13:22,563 --> 00:13:24,714
It's eat or be eaten
when that's convenient,

358
00:13:24,715 --> 00:13:27,067
but when the going gets tough,
Winger gets nervous, huh?

359
00:13:27,068 --> 00:13:28,735
We have no case, Annie.

360
00:13:28,736 --> 00:13:30,570
It's too late to get one, Jeff.

361
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:33,575
We only have time
to get justice.

362
00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:39,808
Tell us what happened next,
Todd.

363
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,135
I disarmed the I.E.D.

364
00:13:42,136 --> 00:13:44,387
and returned the child
to his mother.

365
00:13:44,388 --> 00:13:47,557
She offered to give me her only
possession... a wooden chair...

366
00:13:47,558 --> 00:13:48,775
but I refused.

367
00:13:48,776 --> 00:13:51,844
I was only doing my duty
and we had

368
00:13:51,845 --> 00:13:53,563
plenty of chairs at the base.

369
00:13:53,564 --> 00:13:55,731
And for your valor,
you were awarded a bronze star.

370
00:13:55,732 --> 00:13:58,284
In fact, you have an absolutely
glowing service record.

371
00:13:58,285 --> 00:14:00,153
- Don't you, private?
- I do my best.

372
00:14:00,154 --> 00:14:02,488
You do more than that, soldier.

373
00:14:02,489 --> 00:14:04,791
Certainly more
than this witness

374
00:14:04,792 --> 00:14:06,358
who supposedly saw you
kill the yam.

375
00:14:06,359 --> 00:14:08,744
A man who for all we know

376
00:14:08,745 --> 00:14:10,997
is a holocaust-denying,
9/11 pedophile.

377
00:14:10,998 --> 00:14:13,549
- Objection.
- Withdrawn.

378
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,834
One last question.

379
00:14:14,835 --> 00:14:16,669
Did you intentionally
break into

380
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:19,138
the biology room
with the express purpose

381
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:21,540
of killing
the study group's yam?

382
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,810
- No, sir, I did not.
- Thank you, soldier.

383
00:14:23,811 --> 00:14:27,597
And God bless your testimony.

384
00:14:27,598 --> 00:14:29,599
Your witness.

385
00:14:32,152 --> 00:14:35,988
Tell me, Todd, do you
consider yourself a hero?

386
00:14:35,989 --> 00:14:37,023
Oh, no.

387
00:14:37,024 --> 00:14:38,074
Of course not.

388
00:14:38,075 --> 00:14:40,309
A hero doesn't call
himself a hero.

389
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:42,695
A hero gets called a hero
because of what he does.

390
00:14:42,696 --> 00:14:43,946
And with your
impressive record,

391
00:14:43,947 --> 00:14:45,364
not even I could
deny you the title.

392
00:14:45,365 --> 00:14:47,700
Objection, she's clearly
ramping up to something.

393
00:14:47,701 --> 00:14:49,285
Objection, that's not
a real objection.

394
00:14:49,286 --> 00:14:51,087
Objection, I hate
the both of you.

395
00:14:51,088 --> 00:14:53,523
You may proceed, Ms. Edison,
but do so with caution.

396
00:14:53,524 --> 00:14:56,008
Need I remind you
this is not a courtroom?

397
00:14:56,009 --> 00:14:57,710
I spent the majority
of last night

398
00:14:57,711 --> 00:14:59,128
going over your records
with Mr. Winger,

399
00:14:59,129 --> 00:15:03,599
scouring them for the slightest
mistake, the tiniest slip up.

400
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,019
And I gotta tell you, Todd.
Couldn't find a thing.

401
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,972
Not one little smudge.

402
00:15:09,973 --> 00:15:14,760
Except, of course, for one pesky
yam that just wouldn't grow.

403
00:15:14,761 --> 00:15:16,646
That had to weigh on your soul,
didn't it, Todd?

404
00:15:16,647 --> 00:15:18,764
- Maybe a little.
- A little?

405
00:15:18,765 --> 00:15:22,535
A big orange splotch
on your perfect record?

406
00:15:22,536 --> 00:15:24,904
I bet that pissed you
right off, didn't it?

407
00:15:24,905 --> 00:15:26,489
Is that why you hit your wife?

408
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,957
Withdrawn.

409
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,408
Is that why you drink
and pop pills?

410
00:15:29,409 --> 00:15:30,409
Withdrawn.

411
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,994
Are you a virgin?
Withdrawn.

412
00:15:31,995 --> 00:15:33,293
Did you...

413
00:15:34,915 --> 00:15:38,467
kill our yam to settle
the score, huh?

414
00:15:38,468 --> 00:15:41,453
Did stomping on its roots
make you feel like a big man?

415
00:15:41,454 --> 00:15:42,638
No, it didn't.

416
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,123
I mean, I didn't...

417
00:15:44,124 --> 00:15:45,791
Todd, zip it.

418
00:15:45,792 --> 00:15:48,344
No, you zip it, Uncle Knobby.

419
00:15:48,345 --> 00:15:50,263
I'm not fighting
your wars anymore.

420
00:15:50,264 --> 00:15:51,597
Listen to me, Todd.

421
00:15:51,598 --> 00:15:54,934
I know how scary
a failing grade can be,

422
00:15:54,935 --> 00:15:57,803
but this one dead yam
won't tarnish your record.

423
00:15:57,804 --> 00:16:02,141
What will tarnish it
is lying to your class,

424
00:16:02,142 --> 00:16:03,859
to your teacher, and to me.

425
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,645
The American citizen
you've sworn to protect.

426
00:16:06,646 --> 00:16:09,315
Come on, Todd.

427
00:16:09,316 --> 00:16:11,367
Stop disappointing me.

428
00:16:11,368 --> 00:16:15,154
Defuse the I.E.D.
of dishonesty.

429
00:16:17,585 --> 00:16:18,874
It was an accident.

430
00:16:19,927 --> 00:16:21,627
I just wanted
to look at your yam,

431
00:16:21,628 --> 00:16:25,264
but when I picked up the jar,
it burnt me and I dropped it.

432
00:16:25,265 --> 00:16:27,216
Booyah!

433
00:16:27,217 --> 00:16:30,303
That's how it's done!

434
00:16:30,304 --> 00:16:33,806
âª Ooh, ooh, ooh,
ah, ah, ah, ah âª

435
00:16:33,807 --> 00:16:36,692
- Todd...
- Woo-hoo!

436
00:16:36,693 --> 00:16:37,944
I'm telling your mother.

437
00:16:37,945 --> 00:16:39,028
That's right.

438
00:16:39,029 --> 00:16:42,348
Always have an exit strategy.

439
00:16:44,618 --> 00:16:47,019
I think I've heard enough.

440
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:50,022
Professor Kane, may we have
a sidebar in your office?

441
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,194
I want a mistrial.

442
00:16:55,195 --> 00:16:56,996
Just give us a "C,"
give Todd a "C."

443
00:16:56,997 --> 00:16:58,697
- Excuse me?
- What?

444
00:16:58,698 --> 00:17:01,634
Can we take a sidebar
in this sidebar?

445
00:17:01,635 --> 00:17:03,919
Jeff, we're about
to get our "A."

446
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,538
- Todd didn't do it.
- Um, he just confessed, dummy.

447
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:08,507
He said the jar burned him?

448
00:17:08,508 --> 00:17:09,642
It doesn't make any sense.

449
00:17:09,643 --> 00:17:11,310
People don't half-confess
to crimes.

450
00:17:11,311 --> 00:17:14,380
Look, when we started this,
you were after the truth.

451
00:17:14,381 --> 00:17:17,883
And then I convinced you
it was more important to win.

452
00:17:17,884 --> 00:17:19,819
Don't be like me.

453
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,720
A man's got to have a code.

454
00:17:21,721 --> 00:17:25,074
I can only assume there is
a female equivalent to that.

455
00:17:25,075 --> 00:17:27,159
- A "codette" or something.
- But...

456
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,778
It's not worth getting an "A"

457
00:17:28,779 --> 00:17:31,781
if an innocent man
might get an "F."

458
00:17:33,784 --> 00:17:35,835
Okay, I heard
all of that and I accept.

459
00:17:37,621 --> 00:17:39,705
All right.

460
00:17:39,706 --> 00:17:43,426
After speaking to the wronged
parties, I've decided to...

461
00:17:43,427 --> 00:17:45,961
Uh, if it pleases
the bio class,

462
00:17:45,962 --> 00:17:47,463
I have closing arguments.

463
00:17:47,464 --> 00:17:49,882
Of course you do.

464
00:17:49,883 --> 00:17:55,521
Why was it so hard
for all of us to grow a yam?

465
00:17:55,522 --> 00:17:59,809
It's just a stupid yam
in a stupid jar.

466
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:04,263
We're all fully-grown adults
failing a kindergarten project.

467
00:18:04,264 --> 00:18:06,098
- Can I object?
- I'll allow it.

468
00:18:06,099 --> 00:18:07,116
Sustained.

469
00:18:07,117 --> 00:18:10,102
And all this time we assumed
our yam was targeted,

470
00:18:10,103 --> 00:18:13,322
that someone had stomped
its roots maliciously.

471
00:18:13,323 --> 00:18:16,275
But what if...
what if our yam's roots

472
00:18:16,276 --> 00:18:19,111
were dead before
they hit the ground?

473
00:18:20,831 --> 00:18:22,164
- Hey, that's mine!
- Look at it.

474
00:18:22,165 --> 00:18:23,499
Everyone look.

475
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,168
Smushed without
being stepped on.

476
00:18:27,387 --> 00:18:28,888
Because it didn't
have to be stepped on.

477
00:18:28,889 --> 00:18:31,590
Because it was boiled.

478
00:18:31,591 --> 00:18:36,178
Someone has been pouring boiling
water into our jars at night.

479
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:39,131
No one noticed because the water
cooled off by morning.

480
00:18:39,132 --> 00:18:42,852
Boiling water is the icicle
stabbing of yam killing.

481
00:18:44,771 --> 00:18:46,188
Ooh, but that didn't...

482
00:18:46,189 --> 00:18:48,190
Hmm.

483
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:50,476
This yam isn't boiled.

484
00:18:50,477 --> 00:18:51,610
Vicki?

485
00:18:51,611 --> 00:18:53,863
I don't... I didn't
do it, I swear!

486
00:18:53,864 --> 00:18:54,864
I boiled the yams.

487
00:18:54,865 --> 00:18:56,749
Vicki's yam never sprouted

488
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,782
and I didn't want her to fail,
so I threw off the grading curve

489
00:18:58,783 --> 00:19:00,482
so she wouldn't have
to go to summer school

490
00:19:00,546 --> 00:19:03,144
and we can finally have
sex in my parents' cabin.

491
00:19:03,323 --> 00:19:05,139
God forgive me,
I did it for love!

492
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:08,721
Holy crap.

493
00:19:08,822 --> 00:19:11,761
We are definitely dissecting
pine cones next year.

494
00:19:11,798 --> 00:19:15,167
Neil has agreed to retake
biology over the summer

495
00:19:15,168 --> 00:19:17,836
and his status as
keymaster has been revoked.

496
00:19:17,837 --> 00:19:20,506
After all the politics
and procedure, in the end,

497
00:19:20,507 --> 00:19:22,641
the case really
was about biology.

498
00:19:22,642 --> 00:19:24,944
Told you it was
an important subject.

499
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,281
Hello?

500
00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:37,772
I understand.

501
00:19:39,042 --> 00:19:40,993
Star-Burns got rear-ended

502
00:19:40,994 --> 00:19:44,713
and the meth lab
in his trunk exploded.

503
00:19:45,339 --> 00:19:47,340
He's dead.

504
00:19:54,785 --> 00:19:57,436
- Abed?
- Yeah?

505
00:19:57,437 --> 00:19:59,388
Why don't we have
bunk bed conversations?

506
00:19:59,389 --> 00:20:01,056
I don't know.

507
00:20:01,057 --> 00:20:03,158
We're best friends,
we share a bunk bed.

508
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:04,860
Seems like we should be
having them all the time.

509
00:20:04,861 --> 00:20:06,161
You start.

510
00:20:06,162 --> 00:20:09,381
Okay. Why do you think
they call them "bunk beds"?

511
00:20:09,382 --> 00:20:11,150
Where's the word "bunk"
come from?

512
00:20:11,151 --> 00:20:12,184
I don't know.

513
00:20:12,185 --> 00:20:14,485
I think it comes
from the word "bunker."

514
00:20:14,486 --> 00:20:17,923
So when is your apartment
done being fumigated?

515
00:20:17,924 --> 00:20:19,358
Oh, it was done
about a week ago.

516
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:20,743
Then why are you still here?

517
00:20:20,744 --> 00:20:24,096
- I brought you some warm milk.
- Oh.

518
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,545
There you go.

519
00:20:25,546 --> 00:20:29,401
âª Troy and Abed,
off to Dreamland âª

520
00:20:29,402 --> 00:20:33,074
âª Catching the train
to Sleepytown âª

521
00:20:33,121 --> 00:20:34,454
âª And when they wake up âª

522
00:20:34,507 --> 00:20:36,408
âª The Dean'll be here âª

523
00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:39,044
âª Staring at you âª

524
00:20:39,045 --> 00:20:40,863
Sweet deans.

525
00:20:40,895 --> 00:20:43,680
That's nice... I guess.

526
00:20:44,305 --> 00:20:50,272
