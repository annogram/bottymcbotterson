1
00:00:01,145 --> 00:00:04,915
- Hi, Pierce. Oh...
- Hi!

2
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:07,461
Hi, Percival!

3
00:00:07,463 --> 00:00:09,438
- Hi.
- Hey.

4
00:00:10,002 --> 00:00:13,260
Happy New Year, you guys.
Do anything fun over break?

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,678
Oh, baby Ben got to be
baby Jesus

6
00:00:14,705 --> 00:00:16,205
in our church's nativity play.

7
00:00:16,207 --> 00:00:18,574
Andre was Joseph, and Jordan
was one of the wise men,

8
00:00:18,576 --> 00:00:19,995
and I was in charge of casting.

9
00:00:19,996 --> 00:00:21,916
I digitized
my entire movie collection.

10
00:00:22,088 --> 00:00:23,530
Goodbye, VHS.

11
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,382
Hello, SelectaVision
CED Videodisc.

12
00:00:26,382 --> 00:00:28,615
I'm very psyched
for the new semester.

13
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:32,520
Or should I say...
Intro to Human Psyched.

14
00:00:32,521 --> 00:00:33,747
The worst.

15
00:00:33,747 --> 00:00:36,161
For our midterm,
we actually get to diagnose

16
00:00:36,226 --> 00:00:37,978
a fellow student
with something.

17
00:00:37,978 --> 00:00:39,713
Don't you do way too much
of that already?

18
00:00:39,713 --> 00:00:42,048
Accusational opposition
disorder.

19
00:00:42,049 --> 00:00:43,399
Hello.

20
00:00:43,401 --> 00:00:44,718
Whoa.

21
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,520
It appears you've all noticed
that my swagger

22
00:00:46,521 --> 00:00:47,521
has a new swagger.

23
00:00:47,521 --> 00:00:48,738
I'll explain.

24
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,439
Over break, I took the plunge

25
00:00:50,441 --> 00:00:51,857
and started seeing
a new shrink.

26
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:53,159
What? Hello!

27
00:00:53,161 --> 00:00:55,762
Hello. Anyway,
I talked about my dad,

28
00:00:55,762 --> 00:00:57,030
punched a few pillows.

29
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,832
And she put me on this
amazing anti-anxiety pill.

30
00:00:59,834 --> 00:01:02,402
It's really enhanced
my self-confidence.

31
00:01:02,402 --> 00:01:03,753
I explained that really well.

32
00:01:03,755 --> 00:01:06,673
Jeff, you can't be
on anti-anxiety meds.

33
00:01:06,674 --> 00:01:09,126
What little self-doubt you have
is the only thing

34
00:01:09,126 --> 00:01:10,909
keeping your ego penned in.

35
00:01:10,911 --> 00:01:13,447
You are a textbook narcissist.

36
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,581
I'm an exceptional
narcissist, Britta.

37
00:01:15,582 --> 00:01:18,100
Oh, excuse me.

38
00:01:18,454 --> 00:01:19,757
I didn't kill my wife!

39
00:01:20,685 --> 00:01:23,153
I don't care.

40
00:01:28,908 --> 00:01:31,242
Stop that fugitive!

41
00:01:31,251 --> 00:01:32,718
I was wondering
how long it would take

42
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:33,853
for things to get back
to normal.

43
00:01:33,854 --> 00:01:35,402
Over break, Abed realized
he could hire

44
00:01:35,436 --> 00:01:37,069
celebrity impersonators
from a service

45
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,722
for his own personal use.

46
00:01:38,722 --> 00:01:40,661
He's been doing it...
a lot.

47
00:01:40,661 --> 00:01:41,743
He's not hurting anybody.

48
00:01:41,745 --> 00:01:43,272
He just likes
reenacting scenes from movies.

49
00:01:43,328 --> 00:01:44,778
It's unquestionably awesome.

50
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,430
I question it.
He spent New Year's

51
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,960
locked in our bathroom with
a bad Tom Hanks from cast away.

52
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,082
Abed was the volleyball?

53
00:01:50,084 --> 00:01:51,995
- Well, that makes sense.
- You guys, focus!

54
00:01:52,052 --> 00:01:53,552
Where's he getting the money
for all this?

55
00:01:53,554 --> 00:01:55,639
Intervention.
Intervention. Intervention.

56
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,640
No! You guys need
to stop intervening.

57
00:01:57,641 --> 00:01:59,459
You seriously have a problem.

58
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,894
- I said I didn't kill my wife!
- I still don't care.

59
00:02:01,896 --> 00:02:03,397
Freeze!

60
00:02:04,965 --> 00:02:07,150
Chang, they're just acting!

61
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,695
- Oh. Sorry.
<i>- What was that?</i>

62
00:02:09,697 --> 00:02:12,990
<i>- Somebody call the cops!</i>
- I've got a friend at the zoo.

63
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,643
♪ Give me some rope,
time in a tree ♪

64
00:02:16,644 --> 00:02:19,978

Resync for WEB-DL by Norther

71
00:02:41,602 --> 00:02:44,170
What is this I hear
about a tranquilizer gun?

72
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,022
If you had hit a small student,

73
00:02:46,024 --> 00:02:47,441
they could have died!

74
00:02:47,442 --> 00:02:48,625
I wouldn't do that.

75
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,143
I have a heavy flashlight
for them.

76
00:02:50,144 --> 00:02:51,444
Oh, Ben!

77
00:02:51,445 --> 00:02:54,448
Look, I have to resort
to extreme measures.

78
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:56,515
I'm a one-man army.

79
00:02:56,516 --> 00:02:58,016
You won't let me have
any guards.

80
00:02:58,018 --> 00:02:59,385
We're broke, Ben!

81
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,087
We now get 80%
of our electricity

82
00:03:01,088 --> 00:03:03,956
from the apartment building
across the street.

83
00:03:05,576 --> 00:03:06,661
Okay...

84
00:03:06,711 --> 00:03:09,413
I don't know who told you
pouting was an option for you,

85
00:03:09,413 --> 00:03:11,213
but all you're making
me feel right now

86
00:03:11,215 --> 00:03:15,252
is hatred of Renee Zellweger.

87
00:03:15,252 --> 00:03:18,138
Look, maybe you can
bring on some students

88
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:19,556
as security interns.

89
00:03:19,556 --> 00:03:20,841
I'll let you offer them
a credit

90
00:03:20,841 --> 00:03:23,209
in safety or math or something.

91
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:24,593
Thank you, sir.

92
00:03:24,594 --> 00:03:27,313
You won't regret this
unless I rise up against you.

93
00:03:27,314 --> 00:03:30,182
I don't know why
I said that. Bye.

94
00:03:30,183 --> 00:03:33,218
Huh! Tah!

95
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:38,108
Zhou! Zeet! Dah! Toi!

96
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,861
Jeff. Jeff!

97
00:03:41,862 --> 00:03:43,228
I looked it up.
I was right.

98
00:03:43,229 --> 00:03:44,614
Oh, that thing
about Danny Thomas?

99
00:03:44,615 --> 00:03:45,899
I looked it up too.
Weird.

100
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,734
No, those meds you're taking.

101
00:03:47,735 --> 00:03:50,402
Without anxiety to keep
your vanity in check,

102
00:03:50,403 --> 00:03:54,007
you are vulnerable to a syndrome
called hyper-narcissosis.

103
00:03:54,008 --> 00:03:56,543
Okay, look.
This apple is your ego.

104
00:03:56,543 --> 00:03:59,579
Imagine it expanding
to the point of critical mass,

105
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:01,681
taking over
your whole personality,

106
00:04:01,681 --> 00:04:04,634
making you
an uncontrollable monster.

107
00:04:04,634 --> 00:04:06,719
Britta, how did an apple
make that clear?

108
00:04:06,721 --> 00:04:08,021
Imagine it expanding?

109
00:04:08,021 --> 00:04:09,522
- Use a balloon.
- I was on my way to lunch.

110
00:04:09,524 --> 00:04:11,257
Why are you trying
to take this away from me?

111
00:04:11,258 --> 00:04:12,893
I like having no anxiety.

112
00:04:12,894 --> 00:04:14,026
I'm in harmony with the world.

113
00:04:14,027 --> 00:04:15,562
Looking good, Winger.

114
00:04:15,562 --> 00:04:17,314
Thank you, Leonard,
for that compliment,

115
00:04:17,314 --> 00:04:19,766
and for your service
to this country.

116
00:04:19,766 --> 00:04:21,600
I'm so confident now,
I can pull things off

117
00:04:21,601 --> 00:04:23,069
I never dreamed possible.

118
00:04:23,069 --> 00:04:26,105
Look. Aviators.

119
00:04:26,105 --> 00:04:27,874
Final boarding call,
beefcake airways.

120
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:30,744
I'm warning you as your friend
to get off of those meds.

121
00:04:30,745 --> 00:04:31,911
And until they're out
of your system,

122
00:04:31,913 --> 00:04:33,779
stay away from
flattering situations...

123
00:04:33,781 --> 00:04:36,949
weddings, soft lighting,
formal wear, gay bars.

124
00:04:36,951 --> 00:04:38,451
And take those off!

125
00:04:38,451 --> 00:04:39,536
Because they make me look good?

126
00:04:39,536 --> 00:04:41,086
That's not relevant.

127
00:04:41,088 --> 00:04:43,088
Ah, welcome back, Jeffrey.
How was your...

128
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:44,624
Uhh... uhh... unh!

129
00:04:45,976 --> 00:04:48,293
Oh, my God!
Even his shadow!

130
00:04:48,295 --> 00:04:50,430
Look at his shadow!

131
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,437
Security internship available.

132
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:00,906
Come on, see the world.

133
00:05:00,908 --> 00:05:03,076
Well, you won't see the world,
but come on!

134
00:05:04,327 --> 00:05:07,197
- Hey, Nadir.
- Oh, hey, Vinnie.

135
00:05:07,197 --> 00:05:08,999
Vinnie's the owner
of the doppelgang,

136
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,367
the celebrity impersonator
service I use.

137
00:05:10,367 --> 00:05:11,451
You look familiar.

138
00:05:11,451 --> 00:05:13,536
That's how we all get started
in this racket.

139
00:05:13,538 --> 00:05:15,172
But at a certain point,
if you're smart,

140
00:05:15,173 --> 00:05:17,507
you move up to management
before the gold mine

141
00:05:17,507 --> 00:05:19,826
of resembling French Stewart
runs dry.

142
00:05:19,826 --> 00:05:21,661
- Ah...
- French Stewart...

143
00:05:21,661 --> 00:05:23,045
And speaking of gold mines,

144
00:05:23,047 --> 00:05:24,663
you owe me three grand, pal.

145
00:05:24,665 --> 00:05:25,764
Cool.
Put it on my account.

146
00:05:25,766 --> 00:05:27,430
What do I look like, a sucker?

147
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,805
French Stewart.
But I don't have three grand.

148
00:05:28,836 --> 00:05:30,470
Well, you know what,
you better get it.

149
00:05:30,471 --> 00:05:32,504
Because I'm gonna
tell you something right now...

150
00:05:32,505 --> 00:05:34,841
Holy crap, you'd make
an amazing Seacrest.

151
00:05:34,841 --> 00:05:36,141
Very kind.
Thank you.

152
00:05:36,143 --> 00:05:39,028
You're actually
a lot taller than Seacrest.

153
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:41,113
You've actually got
a sharper jaw too.

154
00:05:41,115 --> 00:05:42,949
You're actually more handsome
than the guy

155
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:43,983
that's famous
for being handsome.

156
00:05:43,985 --> 00:05:46,653
Jeff?

157
00:05:50,691 --> 00:05:54,995
You'll be okay.
Just stay humble.

158
00:05:54,995 --> 00:05:56,829
You know what, maybe
there's another option for you.

159
00:05:56,831 --> 00:05:58,831
I've got a big event saturday.

160
00:05:58,832 --> 00:06:00,699
Needs a lot of bodies, huh?

161
00:06:00,701 --> 00:06:03,168
And I see some
high-value faces here.

162
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,170
Got an Oprah.

163
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,672
- Oh!
- And sitting next to her

164
00:06:05,673 --> 00:06:07,891
is a Judy Garland
or an Anne Hathaway.

165
00:06:07,891 --> 00:06:09,509
Add a few extra teeth.

166
00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:11,011
Wow, this is rare.

167
00:06:11,012 --> 00:06:14,180
Both versions
of Michael Jackson.

168
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,348
And you...

169
00:06:15,348 --> 00:06:16,466
- Fat Brando.
- Burt Reynolds.

170
00:06:16,466 --> 00:06:17,651
- What?
- What?

171
00:06:17,651 --> 00:06:18,651
- Fat Brando.
- Burt Reynolds.

172
00:06:18,653 --> 00:06:19,653
- Whatever.
- Whatever.

173
00:06:19,653 --> 00:06:21,654
Look, if you guys work
this gig for me

174
00:06:21,656 --> 00:06:23,689
for six hours,
we'll call it even.

175
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,108
Sounds fun.

176
00:06:25,108 --> 00:06:27,560
Abed, Vinnie, can we have
a minute to talk about this?

177
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,161
Sure. Come on, Vinnie. The guy
who makes the fish sticks

178
00:06:29,163 --> 00:06:30,413
looks just like Quincy Jones.

179
00:06:30,413 --> 00:06:31,531
- Get out.
- Seriously.

180
00:06:31,531 --> 00:06:32,781
Guys, I'm sorry,

181
00:06:32,783 --> 00:06:34,367
but this is where
we have to put our foot down.

182
00:06:34,367 --> 00:06:35,668
Well, she has a point.

183
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,870
Next time it'll be $10,000,
and then $20,000,

184
00:06:37,872 --> 00:06:39,204
and then he'll hit rock bottom

185
00:06:39,206 --> 00:06:40,706
and have no one to turn to
but Jesus.

186
00:06:40,707 --> 00:06:41,757
I say we let this play out.

187
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,343
I'd love to help,

188
00:06:43,343 --> 00:06:45,095
but playing Ryan Seacrest
at a big party

189
00:06:45,096 --> 00:06:46,963
may not be a safe
situation for me.

190
00:06:46,963 --> 00:06:49,247
We could actually hurt Abed

191
00:06:49,249 --> 00:06:50,800
if every time he faces reality,

192
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,019
we dress up and play
make-believe to bail him out.

193
00:06:53,019 --> 00:06:55,021
Shame on you people.

194
00:06:55,021 --> 00:06:57,507
It's not our job
to help Abed grow up.

195
00:06:57,507 --> 00:06:59,108
Abed doesn't need reality.

196
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:01,528
Abed is a magical,
elf-like man

197
00:07:01,528 --> 00:07:03,312
who makes us all more magical

198
00:07:03,314 --> 00:07:04,663
by being near us.

199
00:07:04,665 --> 00:07:06,483
Pierce, who came over
in the middle of the night

200
00:07:06,483 --> 00:07:07,733
that time you forgot how to
fart?

201
00:07:07,735 --> 00:07:09,101
- Abed.
- Shirley...

202
00:07:09,103 --> 00:07:10,452
Who got you a DVD of Precious,

203
00:07:10,454 --> 00:07:12,154
based on the novel Push,
by Sapphire,

204
00:07:12,156 --> 00:07:14,874
and a copy of the novel Push
autographed by Sapphire?

205
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,242
Abed.

206
00:07:16,242 --> 00:07:18,610
All we had was dumb reality
before we met that man.

207
00:07:18,612 --> 00:07:20,797
And he's made all of our lives
better than reality.

208
00:07:20,798 --> 00:07:22,247
Now it becomes
a little inconvenient,

209
00:07:22,249 --> 00:07:24,584
and it's time to get real?

210
00:07:24,584 --> 00:07:26,720
For shame!

211
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:29,422
He's right.
Sorry, Troy.

212
00:07:29,423 --> 00:07:30,790
Hey, guys.

213
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:33,242
Abed, we would be happy
to help you out.

214
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,761
It'll be a good time.

215
00:07:34,762 --> 00:07:36,461
- Cool. Cool, cool, cool.
- Cool.

216
00:07:36,463 --> 00:07:38,564
- Oprah.
- Oh, thank you.

217
00:07:38,566 --> 00:07:39,816
- See ya, Vin.
- Fat Brando.

218
00:07:39,817 --> 00:07:43,069
- Burt Reynolds.
- Yeah.

219
00:07:43,069 --> 00:07:44,771
Thanks for being flexible.
This'll be fun.

220
00:07:44,771 --> 00:07:47,156
Fun. Yeah, sure.
But here's the deal.

221
00:07:47,158 --> 00:07:49,158
Um, if you guys mess this up,

222
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:51,360
then his debt is overdue.

223
00:07:51,362 --> 00:07:53,478
And I don't send another bill.

224
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,915
No, I send two guys
that look a lot

225
00:07:55,915 --> 00:07:58,201
like Ving Rhames
and Michael Chiklis.

226
00:07:58,201 --> 00:08:00,653
And they do
a very convincing impression

227
00:08:00,653 --> 00:08:03,923
of breaking your friend's legs.

228
00:08:03,923 --> 00:08:07,009
Their secret is...
They actually break them.

229
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:16,821
All right, impersonators,

230
00:08:16,822 --> 00:08:19,247
our guest of honor
is one Howie Schwartz,

231
00:08:19,247 --> 00:08:20,553
who, according to the Talmud,

232
00:08:20,572 --> 00:08:22,918
just became a man.
But I have to say,

233
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:24,879
I wouldn't want him
next to me in a foxhole.

234
00:08:24,928 --> 00:08:26,697
- Ha!
- Ground rules...

235
00:08:26,713 --> 00:08:28,947
Do stay in your
assigned quadrants

236
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:31,117
quoting lines from movies
you are positive

237
00:08:31,117 --> 00:08:33,101
that your impersonatee was in.

238
00:08:33,102 --> 00:08:35,370
Do not leave your quadrant,

239
00:08:35,371 --> 00:08:37,605
burp, fart, cough,
hiccup, or cuss.

240
00:08:37,606 --> 00:08:39,774
The obvious exception
being James,

241
00:08:39,775 --> 00:08:40,942
our resident Walter Matthau.

242
00:08:40,943 --> 00:08:42,245
How you doing, Jimmy?

243
00:08:42,245 --> 00:08:44,580
Aw, you give 'em hell.
All right, let's go.

244
00:08:44,581 --> 00:08:48,616
- All my life I has to fight.
- Ready to tangle.

245
00:08:48,618 --> 00:08:50,753
Handsome Seacrest,
I need you in this tux.

246
00:08:50,754 --> 00:08:52,388
Jeff, do not wear that.

247
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:54,623
Aw, zip it, white Jacko.

248
00:08:54,624 --> 00:08:57,393
Don't worry, that thing
in the cafeteria freaked me out,

249
00:08:57,394 --> 00:08:59,511
so I talked to my shrink,
and she doubled my dosage.

250
00:08:59,513 --> 00:09:01,431
What?
Jeff, that's insane!

251
00:09:01,432 --> 00:09:03,599
I thought so too, but after
I took that extra pill,

252
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,400
it seemed like a great idea.

253
00:09:05,402 --> 00:09:07,986
- Jeff, put it on. Go.
- No, Jeff!

254
00:09:07,988 --> 00:09:09,272
Britta, stop arguing.

255
00:09:09,273 --> 00:09:10,572
If you have anything else
to say,

256
00:09:10,573 --> 00:09:12,524
say it in a high-pitched voice
while walking backwards.

257
00:09:12,525 --> 00:09:14,148
Jeff is in grave danger.

258
00:09:14,148 --> 00:09:15,414
Hee-hee!

259
00:09:17,748 --> 00:09:19,581
Uh, may I help you?

260
00:09:19,582 --> 00:09:22,083
I'm one of the impersonators.

261
00:09:22,085 --> 00:09:26,505
- Which one?
- Do I have to say it?

262
00:09:26,506 --> 00:09:28,124
Burt Reynolds.

263
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:30,375
Uh, yeah, I don't believe
anybody hired you

264
00:09:30,376 --> 00:09:31,659
to impersonate Burt Reynolds.

265
00:09:31,661 --> 00:09:33,796
- Why not?
- Do I have to say it?

266
00:09:46,275 --> 00:09:48,494
- May I help you?
- I'm Brando.

267
00:09:48,495 --> 00:09:50,730
Hmm...

268
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,681
Could be under "fat."

269
00:09:52,682 --> 00:09:55,368
Ah. Oh.

270
00:09:55,369 --> 00:09:56,869
Totally.

271
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:00,322
Go on in.

272
00:10:00,323 --> 00:10:01,990
Bam.

273
00:10:01,991 --> 00:10:03,801
Abed, get back to your station.

274
00:10:03,801 --> 00:10:05,577
I can't right now,
I'm talking to Geena Davis.

275
00:10:05,578 --> 00:10:07,134
Abed, we have to do this right

276
00:10:07,134 --> 00:10:08,184
or Vinnie won't clear
your debt.

277
00:10:08,248 --> 00:10:09,365
Troy, who cares about money?

278
00:10:09,365 --> 00:10:11,000
Look around.
This is why we're alive.

279
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,503
Ooh, fake Lorenzo Lamas.
Let's go.

280
00:10:13,504 --> 00:10:17,789
I was so sad to hear
of your passing.

281
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,725
Me too.

282
00:10:19,725 --> 00:10:23,428
Sergeant Chang,
what are you doing here?

283
00:10:23,429 --> 00:10:25,514
Hey, Annie.
Just one of the perks

284
00:10:25,515 --> 00:10:26,682
when your brother's a rabbi.

285
00:10:26,682 --> 00:10:28,600
He throws me some
private security gigs

286
00:10:28,601 --> 00:10:30,186
at the events he officiates.

287
00:10:30,187 --> 00:10:32,605
They can get really intense
sometimes.

288
00:10:32,605 --> 00:10:36,057
Can you believe some jerk
brought a scalpel to a bris?

289
00:10:36,058 --> 00:10:38,059
Now smile.

290
00:10:38,061 --> 00:10:40,947
Why is he out of his quadrant?

291
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:45,067
I'm Lorenzo Lamas.

292
00:10:45,067 --> 00:10:47,269
- He's reenacting a movie.
- Please.

293
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,587
What movie were
Jamie Lee Curtis

294
00:10:48,588 --> 00:10:50,288
and Lorenzo Lamas in together?

295
00:10:50,289 --> 00:10:52,207
See, now I'm just
embarrassed for you

296
00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:54,509
because you've never seen
Lorenzo's Oil.

297
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:57,129
Lorenzo is an oil tycoon that
gets his address book switched

298
00:10:57,129 --> 00:10:59,748
with Jamie Lee Curtis',

299
00:10:59,749 --> 00:11:02,268
and they give each other
piggyback rides.

300
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,086
I can't believe...
did you go to college?

301
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,389
Yes. No.

302
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,591
Whatever. Keep working.

303
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:19,368
Oh, my God.
You are gorgeous!

304
00:11:19,369 --> 00:11:20,653
Would you look at this one.

305
00:11:20,653 --> 00:11:22,538
He's like a Robert Redford.

306
00:11:22,538 --> 00:11:25,490
No, no, more like a taller,
hotter Ryan Seacrest.

307
00:11:25,491 --> 00:11:27,743
It's amazing,
you're actually more handsome

308
00:11:27,744 --> 00:11:31,212
than the guy who's famous
for being handsome.

309
00:11:35,719 --> 00:11:39,672
Skull Cracker 2000.
Top of the line.

310
00:11:39,673 --> 00:11:42,290
- Who wants to hold it?
- Me!

311
00:11:42,292 --> 00:11:44,960
- That's so cool.
- Awesome.

312
00:11:44,961 --> 00:11:47,196
Dude, this is so sick.
Check this out.

313
00:11:51,985 --> 00:11:55,770
Any of you fine young men
interested in a college credit?

314
00:11:55,772 --> 00:11:57,088
- Sure!
- Right!

315
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,697
Look, man,
if you have a request,

316
00:12:04,697 --> 00:12:06,599
not a real DJ, okay.
These are just props.

317
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,033
You look like a friend of mine.

318
00:12:08,034 --> 00:12:09,619
You're friends with Moby?

319
00:12:21,965 --> 00:12:24,432
- Jeff!
- Oh!

320
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:27,552
I haven't been dipped like that

321
00:12:27,553 --> 00:12:29,388
since my last divorce.

322
00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:31,173
Britta, you were right.

323
00:12:31,173 --> 00:12:33,676
I can feel my ego taking over.
Do something!

324
00:12:33,677 --> 00:12:34,894
Okay, listen to me.

325
00:12:34,894 --> 00:12:37,529
You are not that big of a deal.
Do you understand?

326
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,014
You have bad posture.

327
00:12:39,014 --> 00:12:41,817
When you do to many push-ups,
it looks like you have boobs.

328
00:12:41,817 --> 00:12:44,070
The tile in your bathroom
is tacky.

329
00:12:44,071 --> 00:12:46,538
You were emotionally
closed off in bed

330
00:12:46,539 --> 00:12:48,323
to the point where
one time, I didn't come up

331
00:12:48,325 --> 00:12:50,909
because I couldn't find
close enough parking.

332
00:12:50,911 --> 00:12:53,712
You have an unusually high
butt crack.

333
00:12:53,713 --> 00:12:56,865
Thank you.

334
00:12:56,866 --> 00:12:58,584
It couldn't have been easy
for you to lie like that.

335
00:12:58,585 --> 00:13:00,336
We are getting you out of here.

336
00:13:00,336 --> 00:13:02,538
Get back to your quadrant.
Now!

337
00:13:02,538 --> 00:13:04,005
Britta!

338
00:13:04,006 --> 00:13:06,207
Honey, you were the highlight
of the evening.

339
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:09,979
If it were up to me,
you'd win every single award.

340
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,965
There's awards?

341
00:13:16,881 --> 00:13:19,041
Ladies and non-gentilemen,

342
00:13:19,042 --> 00:13:22,177
welcome to Howie Schwartz's
Star Mitzvah Awards.

343
00:13:22,178 --> 00:13:23,763
Here to present the first award

344
00:13:23,764 --> 00:13:26,532
are fake Morgan Freeman
and fake Bono.

345
00:13:26,533 --> 00:13:29,217
You know, fake Bono,
algebra can be tough.

346
00:13:29,219 --> 00:13:30,885
It sure can,
fake Morgan Freeman.

347
00:13:30,886 --> 00:13:32,520
And that's why
it's so important

348
00:13:32,522 --> 00:13:34,774
to reward those
to whom it comes so easily.

349
00:13:34,774 --> 00:13:39,061
The winner for
best math student is...

350
00:13:39,062 --> 00:13:40,162
Howie Schwartz.

351
00:13:46,836 --> 00:13:49,672
Wow, these things are heavy.

352
00:13:49,673 --> 00:13:53,042
The award for cleanest room
goes to Howie Schwartz.

353
00:13:54,177 --> 00:13:58,514
Coolest skateboard trick,
Howie Schwartz!

354
00:13:58,514 --> 00:14:02,017
♪ Howie Schwartz!

355
00:14:04,638 --> 00:14:06,772
If you ask me, I think
you're gonna win the award

356
00:14:06,773 --> 00:14:08,724
for most handsome young man.

357
00:14:08,725 --> 00:14:12,927
Nah. Oh, give me a break.
It's his Bar Mitzvah.

358
00:14:12,928 --> 00:14:14,596
Jeff, I think
that we should go.

359
00:14:14,596 --> 00:14:18,033
There's an award
for most handsome young man!

360
00:14:18,033 --> 00:14:20,402
Hello, everyone.
It is my honor and privilege

361
00:14:20,403 --> 00:14:23,572
as fake Oprah Winfrey to present
the night's final award...

362
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:25,423
most handsome young man.

363
00:14:25,424 --> 00:14:26,875
Aww...

364
00:14:26,876 --> 00:14:30,546
And the winner is...

365
00:14:30,547 --> 00:14:32,947
Howie Schwartz!

366
00:14:32,948 --> 00:14:35,951
Nooo!

367
00:14:44,727 --> 00:14:48,730
Aah!

368
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:57,822
Look at me!
Look at meee!

369
00:14:57,823 --> 00:15:00,642
No, Jeffrey!
Jeffrey... oh!

370
00:15:00,643 --> 00:15:01,860
Oh!

371
00:15:01,861 --> 00:15:03,895
Oh, God, no!

372
00:15:03,897 --> 00:15:06,715
- What the hell?
- You wanted it!

373
00:15:06,716 --> 00:15:09,418
You all want it!

374
00:15:09,418 --> 00:15:11,921
Aahhh-ha-ha-ha!

375
00:15:11,922 --> 00:15:15,157
Aaahh!

376
00:15:15,158 --> 00:15:16,591
- Rargh!
- Aah!

377
00:15:16,592 --> 00:15:19,510
- Grr!
- Ow!

378
00:15:19,511 --> 00:15:23,581
Ah!

379
00:15:23,582 --> 00:15:26,100
Unh! Grr!
Ha!

380
00:15:34,144 --> 00:15:37,375
I love you, dad!
I knew you'd invite the Hulk!

381
00:15:44,321 --> 00:15:47,855
You're lucky.
And your friend's debt is paid.

382
00:15:47,856 --> 00:15:50,716
Hey, Jimmy, wait up.

383
00:15:57,466 --> 00:15:59,969
Boogie Nights.

384
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:04,505
You're fat Burt Reynolds,
right?

385
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:07,308
I'll take it.

386
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:16,818
Abed, your leg!
What'd they do?

387
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,136
Tell me who they looked like!

388
00:16:18,138 --> 00:16:19,605
Doc, doc! Who's there?

389
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:21,774
It's your femur bone.
He needs some money. He's broke.

390
00:16:21,774 --> 00:16:24,025
Ha ha ha. Hey.

391
00:16:24,027 --> 00:16:25,443
Laughter's the best medicine.

392
00:16:25,445 --> 00:16:27,830
What are...
what are you doing?

393
00:16:27,831 --> 00:16:30,282
I'm challenging your entire
medical establishment, sir.

394
00:16:30,283 --> 00:16:33,402
Not you.

395
00:16:33,403 --> 00:16:36,738
So we just spent our whole night
paying off your debt,

396
00:16:36,739 --> 00:16:38,841
and you're blowing money
on a Patch Adams?

397
00:16:38,841 --> 00:16:42,076
It's two for one.
We're doing Popeye next.

398
00:16:42,077 --> 00:16:43,245
Ah-ga-ga-ga-ga.

399
00:16:43,245 --> 00:16:46,081
Get him some spinach.

400
00:16:46,081 --> 00:16:47,985
I'm Olive Oyl.

401
00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:54,773
Get out!

402
00:17:13,792 --> 00:17:16,878
Are you mad at me?

403
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,280
- No.
- Cool.

404
00:17:19,281 --> 00:17:20,265
I was gonna go
in the Dreamatorium

405
00:17:20,266 --> 00:17:21,666
and play Inspector Spacetime.

406
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:24,553
Have fun.

407
00:17:28,807 --> 00:17:31,643
- Abed.
- Yeah?

408
00:17:31,644 --> 00:17:35,064
Come here.

409
00:17:40,836 --> 00:17:42,104
I am mad at you.

410
00:17:42,105 --> 00:17:43,806
You said you weren't.
We never lie.

411
00:17:43,807 --> 00:17:45,406
- I know.
- We made a deal.

412
00:17:45,407 --> 00:17:47,394
October 15, 2009.
Friends don't lie to each other.

413
00:17:47,395 --> 00:17:49,644
I know! I lied.

414
00:17:49,645 --> 00:17:51,430
Because you don't like people
who tell you what to do,

415
00:17:51,431 --> 00:17:52,730
and I don't want to be
one of those people.

416
00:17:52,731 --> 00:17:54,282
- Then don't be.
- I have to be.

417
00:17:54,284 --> 00:17:56,234
You have to stop renting
celebrity impersonators.

418
00:17:56,236 --> 00:17:58,336
Vinnie was gonna break
both of your legs.

419
00:17:58,337 --> 00:18:00,189
I had to work really hard
to help you.

420
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:01,173
But that's what you wanted
to do.

421
00:18:01,173 --> 00:18:02,624
Yes.

422
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,593
But I can't do
what I want to do?

423
00:18:04,594 --> 00:18:05,961
I guess not.
Not all the time.

424
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:07,479
Sometimes you're just
gonna have to trust

425
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,815
- that I know better about stuff.
- I don't know if I can do that.

426
00:18:09,816 --> 00:18:11,316
Then I guess
you're gonna have to trust

427
00:18:11,317 --> 00:18:13,519
that you're gonna have
to trust me.

428
00:18:15,821 --> 00:18:20,058
Well, I don't want to stop
being your friend, so...

429
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:24,011
I guess I'll let you
tell me what to do sometimes.

430
00:18:24,012 --> 00:18:25,887
Still best friends?

431
00:18:25,888 --> 00:18:28,145
Yeah.

432
00:18:29,618 --> 00:18:31,685
Still best friends.
Always.

433
00:18:31,686 --> 00:18:33,688
Cool.
Cool, cool, cool.

434
00:18:33,689 --> 00:18:35,190
You still gonna go
to the Dreamatorium?

435
00:18:35,191 --> 00:18:37,041
Oh, yeah, but I think I'm
gonna play by myself right now,

436
00:18:37,042 --> 00:18:38,192
if that's okay.

437
00:18:38,193 --> 00:18:41,363
Cool. Okay.

438
00:18:41,364 --> 00:18:43,965
Cool.

439
00:18:48,371 --> 00:18:50,255
Seacrest Hulk,
you're the greatest!

440
00:18:50,256 --> 00:18:55,042
Whoo!
You rock, Seacrest Hulk!

441
00:18:56,813 --> 00:19:01,232
I love you, Seacrest Hulk!

442
00:19:01,233 --> 00:19:04,736
You know, Seacrest Hulk,
you're a meshugeneh.

443
00:19:20,403 --> 00:19:21,787
You okay?

444
00:19:21,788 --> 00:19:24,905
No.
I ruined a Bar Mitzvah.

445
00:19:24,906 --> 00:19:26,074
I'm a bad person.

446
00:19:26,075 --> 00:19:28,009
What you're feeling
is called shame.

447
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:29,411
It means you're getting better.

448
00:19:29,412 --> 00:19:33,414
You're gonna be safe again
once those pills wear off.

449
00:19:33,415 --> 00:19:36,602
Um, I was thinking...

450
00:19:36,603 --> 00:19:40,138
You know that person that you
study for your psych class?

451
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,423
Maybe that should be me.

452
00:19:42,424 --> 00:19:43,942
Uh-uh. No way.

453
00:19:43,942 --> 00:19:46,561
You are way out of my league,
diagnostically speaking.

454
00:19:46,563 --> 00:19:48,814
I'm gonna go with someone
a little less complicated.

455
00:19:48,815 --> 00:19:50,932
Like Abed.

456
00:20:08,585 --> 00:20:11,603
Hi, Abed.

457
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,375
- Hi.
- Where's Troy?

458
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:18,309
In the other room.

459
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,644
That's okay.
There are many advantages

460
00:20:19,645 --> 00:20:20,863
of traveling by yourself.

461
00:20:20,864 --> 00:20:22,897
You can drive faster,
change direction.

462
00:20:22,898 --> 00:20:24,599
And the only pee breaks
are yours.

463
00:20:24,601 --> 00:20:28,769
- Are you real?
- Are you?

464
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:29,904
This is really crazy.

465
00:20:29,905 --> 00:20:31,272
And inaccessible,
and maybe too dark.

466
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:34,409
Maybe to them, but not to us.

467
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:37,496
Cool.
Cool, cool, cool.

468
00:20:37,497 --> 00:20:40,065
Hot.
Hot, hot, hot.

469
00:21:02,488 --> 00:21:03,942
Gentlemen...

470
00:21:03,943 --> 00:21:06,674
Who's ready to chang the world?

471
00:21:06,675 --> 00:21:11,021
Chang! Chang! Chang!

472
00:21:11,022 --> 00:21:15,119
Chang! Chang! Chang!
Chang! Chang!

473
00:21:15,121 --> 00:21:16,721
All hail Chang!
