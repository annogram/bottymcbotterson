1
00:00:01,591 --> 00:00:04,478
Halloween... a time of vampires,

2
00:00:04,479 --> 00:00:08,624
hobgoblins, Draculas,
boogens, and headless mice.

3
00:00:08,625 --> 00:00:10,302
I'm George Takei.

4
00:00:10,602 --> 00:00:11,660
You know what?

5
00:00:11,661 --> 00:00:13,402
Let's just get to it.

6
00:00:15,612 --> 00:00:17,295
- Mm-hmm.
- How is it?

7
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,864
Pretty good taco meat.

8
00:00:19,865 --> 00:00:21,951
I wonder how the dean
scored this sweet spread.

9
00:00:21,952 --> 00:00:22,796
Ah, ah, ah.

10
00:00:22,797 --> 00:00:25,710
Chef gaga never
reveals her caterer.

11
00:00:25,711 --> 00:00:29,128
And don't try reading
my p-p-p-poker face.

12
00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:32,755
It's military rations
from an army surplus store.

13
00:00:35,299 --> 00:00:36,145
I didn't read your poker face.

14
00:00:36,146 --> 00:00:37,850
You left the containers
in the garbage.

15
00:00:38,387 --> 00:00:41,015
Oh, well, um, you guys have fun.

16
00:00:41,016 --> 00:00:42,885
I'm gonna... gonna
take out the garbage.

17
00:00:42,886 --> 00:00:45,314
Oh, you may also want to
adjust your iTunes setting.

18
00:00:45,315 --> 00:00:49,083
When it's not playing an endless
loop of Abba's greatest hits,

19
00:00:49,094 --> 00:00:52,456
it's playing what I think may
be your personal voice memos.

20
00:00:52,457 --> 00:00:53,190
What?

21
00:00:53,191 --> 00:00:55,918
Note to self... get oil changed,

22
00:00:55,919 --> 00:00:58,704
check Netflix for that
movie where Greg Kinnear...

23
00:00:58,705 --> 00:01:01,193
Plays a ghost... no, an angel...

24
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,346
and something called human centi...

25
00:01:06,223 --> 00:01:07,641
- David Beckham.
- Hmm.

26
00:01:08,007 --> 00:01:09,125
Dragon turtle?

27
00:01:09,252 --> 00:01:10,312
T-Rex.

28
00:01:10,645 --> 00:01:12,308
Man, I wonder how much effort

29
00:01:12,309 --> 00:01:14,425
you put into being
accidentally handsome

30
00:01:14,426 --> 00:01:16,006
for a costume every year.

31
00:01:16,007 --> 00:01:17,513
Only half the effort
you'll be putting

32
00:01:17,514 --> 00:01:19,285
into eating and drinking tonight.

33
00:01:19,286 --> 00:01:21,433
Let me help you, dragon turtle.

34
00:01:21,434 --> 00:01:23,794
Guys, Shirley's
costume is once again

35
00:01:23,795 --> 00:01:25,230
unwittingly ambiguous.

36
00:01:25,231 --> 00:01:26,586
I don't know what
she's supposed to be,

37
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,490
but I do know she's
not miss piggy.

38
00:01:28,491 --> 00:01:31,094
I repeat... she is not miss piggy.

39
00:01:31,107 --> 00:01:32,433
You're on your own.

40
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:35,335
Hello! Guess who I am.

41
00:01:36,672 --> 00:01:38,688
Um, can't you just say?

42
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:40,005
No.

43
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:44,110
Pierce, are you okay?

44
00:01:44,111 --> 00:01:45,934
Huh? What? Huh?

45
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,069
Whoa.

46
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,866
Hey, if you get any
more sweaty and puffy,

47
00:01:49,867 --> 00:01:52,410
your costume's gonna reach
new levels of authenticity.

48
00:01:52,411 --> 00:01:54,109
Oh, I don't understand. Shut up.

49
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,709
He's acting like
the impression of him

50
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,077
we do behind his back.

51
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,796
Get away from me!

52
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:07,193
Oh, man, just when
you think it's funny.

53
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:08,200
Pierce?

54
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,978
Okay, okay, okay. Ooh.

55
00:02:10,358 --> 00:02:12,017
Oh, excuse me.

56
00:02:12,034 --> 00:02:13,858
I think my friend is really sick.

57
00:02:13,859 --> 00:02:14,899
I'm not a doctor.

58
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:15,941
I'm a doctor.

59
00:02:17,143 --> 00:02:19,196
Annie! Rich from pottery class.

60
00:02:19,197 --> 00:02:21,461
- Oh, hey!
- Oh, hey.

61
00:02:21,628 --> 00:02:22,976
Wow, this looks serious. - Yeah.

62
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:24,598
Let's... you know what?
Let's get him over here.

63
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:25,760
- Okay.
- Oh, boy.

64
00:02:25,761 --> 00:02:28,810
He is just not in very
good shape, is he?

65
00:02:28,886 --> 00:02:30,420
But you look fantastic.

66
00:02:30,421 --> 00:02:32,146
Oh, thank you.

67
00:02:32,147 --> 00:02:34,646
Look at you with your hood.

68
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

69
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:48,266
Get away from those hotties!

70
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:05,551
You're safe now.

71
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:07,932
But if that thing comes back,
I'm gonna need

72
00:03:07,933 --> 00:03:09,447
one or both of your phone numbers.

73
00:03:09,448 --> 00:03:11,819
Yeah, right.

74
00:03:18,593 --> 00:03:19,625
I don't get it.

75
00:03:20,722 --> 00:03:21,781
How do you do it?

76
00:03:21,782 --> 00:03:24,419
Well, I am wearing
a $6,000 suit,

77
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,573
and you spent 3 days making
cardboard robot armor.

78
00:03:27,584 --> 00:03:29,431
You're saying they
feel sorry for you?

79
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,950
I'm saying I remind girls less

80
00:03:30,951 --> 00:03:33,385
of taking their little
brothers to comic-con.

81
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:36,803
- Rich.
- More?

82
00:03:37,002 --> 00:03:38,373
Put her with the others.

83
00:03:39,134 --> 00:03:41,233
102... this may be food poisoning.

84
00:03:41,234 --> 00:03:43,202
Rich, what did I tell you?

85
00:03:43,203 --> 00:03:45,096
- To rule out food poisoning.
- Yes.

86
00:03:45,097 --> 00:03:47,078
But also not to say
the words out loud.

87
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:49,313
Who wants to walk my plank, huh?

88
00:03:49,351 --> 00:03:50,144
Hey.

89
00:04:01,797 --> 00:04:03,382
Okay, I'm ruling
out food poisoning.

90
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,832
Guess who I am.

91
00:04:37,052 --> 00:04:38,159
Michelle Kwan?

92
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,056
Wrong.

93
00:04:39,194 --> 00:04:40,479
Kristi Yamaguchi?

94
00:04:40,484 --> 00:04:41,586
Peggy Fleming.

95
00:04:41,968 --> 00:04:43,711
Just been proven racist

96
00:04:43,712 --> 00:04:45,685
by the racist-prover.

97
00:04:47,336 --> 00:04:49,668
Hey, guess who I am.

98
00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:50,627
Drink.

99
00:04:52,436 --> 00:04:53,753
Have you noticed a weird vibe

100
00:04:53,754 --> 00:04:55,198
taking a hold of this party?

101
00:04:55,507 --> 00:04:57,411
It's like every fifth
person is on something

102
00:04:57,412 --> 00:04:59,001
seriously hard-core.

103
00:04:59,802 --> 00:05:01,517
Yeah, I wonder who's holding...

104
00:05:01,582 --> 00:05:03,521
The key to your riddle.

105
00:05:06,191 --> 00:05:07,866
- Hey.
- Hey.

106
00:05:10,924 --> 00:05:12,041
Where's your costume?

107
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,378
Trying something new.

108
00:05:13,403 --> 00:05:15,717
But our costumes go together,
and if you're not in yours,

109
00:05:15,718 --> 00:05:17,453
I'm just a guy in a spandex
suit and a bike helmet.

110
00:05:17,454 --> 00:05:20,895
- Well, I'm a sexy Dracula.
- You mean vampire.

111
00:05:20,896 --> 00:05:23,327
I don't need to know
which Dracula I am

112
00:05:23,328 --> 00:05:24,546
to be a Dracula.

113
00:05:24,637 --> 00:05:25,740
Nerd.

114
00:05:31,596 --> 00:05:33,272
Your symptoms are
progressing even faster

115
00:05:33,273 --> 00:05:34,480
than everyone else's.

116
00:05:34,481 --> 00:05:36,597
How much of that taco-meat
stuff did you eat, star-burns?

117
00:05:36,598 --> 00:05:37,980
I didn't eat any.

118
00:05:38,352 --> 00:05:39,907
My name is Alex!

119
00:05:39,908 --> 00:05:41,006
Whatever it is
must have transferred

120
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,356
through Pierce's bite.

121
00:05:42,357 --> 00:05:43,963
My God, I think you're right.

122
00:05:44,347 --> 00:05:46,204
Annie, you make quite
the little nurse.

123
00:05:46,205 --> 00:05:47,648
Thank you, rich.

124
00:05:47,826 --> 00:05:49,703
You're quite a banana.

125
00:05:49,704 --> 00:05:52,794
Jeez, why don't you
guys just get a roo...

126
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,364
but the only people getting sick

127
00:06:02,365 --> 00:06:05,918
are the ones eating what I
bought at your surplus store.

128
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,217
I never said the
stuff was delicious,

129
00:06:08,218 --> 00:06:09,262
but you can't get sick from it.

130
00:06:09,263 --> 00:06:10,411
It's nonperishable.

131
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:12,058
What about the taco-meat stuff...

132
00:06:12,059 --> 00:06:13,721
the classic flavor? - The what?

133
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:15,837
The one with the goofy label.

134
00:06:15,838 --> 00:06:17,479
Here.

135
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,103
"Classified Phoenix.

136
00:06:19,104 --> 00:06:21,082
"If found, repeat key phrase...

137
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:23,783
echo, tango, X-ray,
nine, nine, seven."

138
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:25,580
Yeah. Sounds delicious.

139
00:06:25,581 --> 00:06:28,595
Anyway, it looks
like taco meat and...

140
00:06:30,297 --> 00:06:31,157
hello?

141
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:32,740
Greendale community college?

142
00:06:33,623 --> 00:06:34,624
Speaking.

143
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:37,185
This is special
operations officer McHenry.

144
00:06:38,152 --> 00:06:39,222
Hi.

145
00:06:39,335 --> 00:06:42,622
I need you to listen
to me very carefully.

146
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:45,724
Okay, one hint.

147
00:06:45,725 --> 00:06:48,200
I'm a beloved character
from our childhood.

148
00:06:48,201 --> 00:06:50,543
- I can't stop seeing it.
- I know.

149
00:06:53,105 --> 00:06:55,519
Leonard, behave yourself.
I'm a Christian woman.

150
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,659
Leonard, you better back
that pumpkin ass up,

151
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,167
or I will make a pie.

152
00:07:01,466 --> 00:07:03,763
Hey, Jeff, it's me, rich,
from pottery class.

153
00:07:04,134 --> 00:07:05,547
"Doc Potterywood," remember?
'Cause we were...

154
00:07:05,548 --> 00:07:06,940
- rich, bigger fish.
- Yeah.

155
00:07:06,941 --> 00:07:08,789
Guys, there's some kind
of infection at the party

156
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,982
that's making people act
weird and bite each other.

157
00:07:10,983 --> 00:07:12,832
We need to coordinate
an orderly evacuation

158
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,685
without causing unnecessary panic.

159
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,289
Holy crap!

160
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:18,689
Leonard's a zombie!

161
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:21,906
Zombie attack!

162
00:07:26,425 --> 00:07:27,482
Never mind.

163
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,207
Oh, my God! Ah!

164
00:07:42,459 --> 00:07:44,552
- I'm sorry.
- Open the door!

165
00:07:44,553 --> 00:07:46,861
I've been told we need
a little baby quarantine

166
00:07:46,862 --> 00:07:48,166
until the army gets here.

167
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:49,282
The army?

168
00:07:49,283 --> 00:07:50,744
I know, right?

169
00:07:51,273 --> 00:07:53,318
They said to wait for six hours.

170
00:07:53,754 --> 00:07:54,847
Stay strong.

171
00:07:54,848 --> 00:07:55,881
Guys...

172
00:07:56,181 --> 00:07:58,558
I hate to be the
"we've got company" guy, but...

173
00:07:58,581 --> 00:07:59,635
oh!

174
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:06,492
Hey, guess who I am.

175
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:09,618
Or don't.

176
00:08:11,723 --> 00:08:12,762
Head to the back!

177
00:08:14,871 --> 00:08:15,937
Run!

178
00:08:28,784 --> 00:08:30,649
You punched a lady bee!

179
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:34,073
No!

180
00:08:35,043 --> 00:08:38,321
Let go of the door,
you little bitch!

181
00:08:38,354 --> 00:08:39,344
Welcome!

182
00:08:39,505 --> 00:08:41,367
Oh, thank God you're all right!

183
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:43,872
Whoo! We did it!

184
00:08:48,434 --> 00:08:50,537
Okay, did we lose
anybody out there?

185
00:08:50,538 --> 00:08:51,631
- No.
- Is anybody hurt?

186
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:52,541
No.

187
00:08:52,542 --> 00:08:54,616
Okay, last question,
and I know it's a long shot,

188
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:57,134
but did anybody happen to
shut off the dean's playlist?

189
00:08:57,135 --> 00:09:00,056
Two percent milk, eggs,
deodorant, puppy chow...

190
00:09:00,952 --> 00:09:04,494
Okay, it's a officially
a waking nightmare.

191
00:09:10,387 --> 00:09:12,351
When are the police coming?

192
00:09:12,411 --> 00:09:14,238
- Help is on the way.
- Hello?

193
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,761
Help is on the way.

194
00:09:15,762 --> 00:09:17,614
- Hello?
- Help is on the way.

195
00:09:17,634 --> 00:09:19,070
Flavor flav was right.

196
00:09:19,071 --> 00:09:20,651
It's the end of days.

197
00:09:20,652 --> 00:09:22,177
It can't be the end of days.

198
00:09:22,178 --> 00:09:23,692
It's not 2012 yet.

199
00:09:23,693 --> 00:09:25,167
It's not the end of days.

200
00:09:25,168 --> 00:09:26,950
There seems to be a
rabies-related pathogen

201
00:09:26,951 --> 00:09:29,012
affecting the prefrontal
cortex of the brain,

202
00:09:29,013 --> 00:09:30,492
causing hyper aggression.

203
00:09:30,493 --> 00:09:32,610
It could take years for
it to take over the world.

204
00:09:32,611 --> 00:09:34,797
- How many years?
- 1, 1 1/2.

205
00:09:35,465 --> 00:09:37,198
2012! End of days!

206
00:09:37,199 --> 00:09:39,330
End of days! End of days!

207
00:09:40,094 --> 00:09:41,036
Good thinking, Jeff...

208
00:09:41,037 --> 00:09:42,120
vertical fold.

209
00:09:42,892 --> 00:09:44,109
You making fun of me?

210
00:09:44,653 --> 00:09:46,576
That jacket is worth
more than the island

211
00:09:46,577 --> 00:09:48,561
you were grown on, Chiquita M.D.

212
00:09:48,781 --> 00:09:50,400
"Chiquita m. D."... I like it.

213
00:09:50,401 --> 00:09:52,678
Rich, this is a good time to
let you know that I hate you.

214
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:54,233
Shouldn't we be
barricading the room?

215
00:09:54,234 --> 00:09:55,955
I don't know.
These guys don't seem so...

216
00:09:55,956 --> 00:09:57,596
- Argh!
- I will help you.

217
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,617
Wait! Wait!

218
00:09:58,618 --> 00:10:00,162
Before you barricade us in,
I need to ask

219
00:10:00,163 --> 00:10:01,521
if anyone has been bitten.

220
00:10:01,522 --> 00:10:03,626
You bit, huh? You bit?

221
00:10:03,627 --> 00:10:05,914
This pathogen is
spread through bites,

222
00:10:05,915 --> 00:10:07,821
so if anyone has been
bitten and you allow us

223
00:10:07,822 --> 00:10:09,416
to seal ourselves
in here with you,

224
00:10:09,417 --> 00:10:11,787
you're putting us all in danger.

225
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,525
All right, go ahead.

226
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,733
Are we really
just gonna sit here?

227
00:10:20,734 --> 00:10:22,879
The army's gonna
be here in six hours.

228
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,268
Why six hours?
Are they hosting the Oscars?

229
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:26,269
Damn.

230
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,134
And the winner for best
adapted Oscar burn,

231
00:10:28,141 --> 00:10:31,113
Jeff winger for "oh,
snap! The man who went there."

232
00:10:31,114 --> 00:10:32,796
Those people don't
have six hours.

233
00:10:32,797 --> 00:10:35,124
Judging from the temperatures
of those infected...

234
00:10:35,698 --> 00:10:37,067
Within three hours,
they're gonna start suffering

235
00:10:37,068 --> 00:10:37,905
from brain damage.

236
00:10:37,906 --> 00:10:39,578
Three hours after that,
they're gonna be dead.

237
00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:41,543
What? We have to do
something for them.

238
00:10:41,544 --> 00:10:44,060
Do something? For the zombies?

239
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:45,842
If we lower the temperature
of the whole building,

240
00:10:45,908 --> 00:10:47,887
would it break the fever
and kill the virus?

241
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,946
It might.

242
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,110
I know where the thermostat is...
out there on the wall.

243
00:10:53,518 --> 00:10:55,847
Troy, we have to rise to
the occasion like Ripley

244
00:10:55,848 --> 00:10:57,018
and kick monster
butt in our undies.

245
00:10:57,019 --> 00:10:58,460
I'm not Ripley, Abed.

246
00:10:58,461 --> 00:11:00,456
I'm a cool, sexy Dracula.

247
00:11:00,457 --> 00:11:02,186
I make love to ladies,
and I survive.

248
00:11:02,187 --> 00:11:03,106
I'm with Troy.

249
00:11:03,107 --> 00:11:05,070
Guys, those are not zombies.

250
00:11:05,071 --> 00:11:07,122
Those are our classmates,
and they're sick.

251
00:11:07,123 --> 00:11:08,943
And they can make
us sick by biting us.

252
00:11:08,944 --> 00:11:10,743
The banana said so. - It's true.

253
00:11:10,744 --> 00:11:12,404
The incubation only takes minutes.

254
00:11:12,551 --> 00:11:13,856
First, you get a stomachache.

255
00:11:13,857 --> 00:11:16,443
Then your skin turns red,
followed by cold sweats.

256
00:11:16,444 --> 00:11:18,288
Muscle spasms, high fever,

257
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:21,211
and then the uncontrollable
urge to bite uninfected flesh.

258
00:11:21,212 --> 00:11:22,253
Oh, Jesus.

259
00:11:22,254 --> 00:11:23,697
And I forgot one symptom.

260
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:27,007
Slurred speech.

261
00:11:27,008 --> 00:11:29,419
Hey, you got bit!

262
00:11:29,902 --> 00:11:32,583
I felt like maybe I was special.

263
00:11:32,634 --> 00:11:34,688
Special? You're not special.

264
00:11:34,689 --> 00:11:35,899
I'm special.

265
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,402
I was bit ten minutes ago,
and I'm...

266
00:11:38,403 --> 00:11:39,940
Fine.

267
00:11:40,027 --> 00:11:41,130
Oh, great.

268
00:11:41,131 --> 00:11:43,073
Nobody is special!

269
00:11:43,074 --> 00:11:46,334
Hey, rich, just so you know,
I hate you less now.

270
00:11:46,335 --> 00:11:48,717
That's how much I
hate your normal self.

271
00:11:49,318 --> 00:11:50,960
You have to destroy his brain.

272
00:11:53,687 --> 00:11:55,059
What the hell?

273
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:02,694
- A hamster!
- Way to go!

274
00:12:02,695 --> 00:12:03,403
Run!

275
00:12:03,404 --> 00:12:05,172
Run! Run!

276
00:12:11,251 --> 00:12:12,713
Head for the stairs!

277
00:12:16,637 --> 00:12:19,060
- What about Annie?
- Don't look back!

278
00:12:19,061 --> 00:12:20,275
Why not?

279
00:12:20,285 --> 00:12:21,237
Oh!

280
00:12:21,447 --> 00:12:23,223
Shirley, oh, God.

281
00:12:23,427 --> 00:12:24,689
Don't look back!

282
00:12:26,147 --> 00:12:27,038
Oh!

283
00:12:39,012 --> 00:12:42,693
Oh, this is how I die...
As miss piggy.

284
00:12:42,776 --> 00:12:44,010
You're not miss piggy.

285
00:12:44,015 --> 00:12:45,603
You're Glenda the good witch.

286
00:12:45,604 --> 00:12:47,989
Oh! You knew?

287
00:12:48,933 --> 00:12:51,684
Just so you know,
I've always loved Peggy Fleming.

288
00:12:53,249 --> 00:12:54,489
You're not racist.

289
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,448
Mm-mm.

290
00:13:11,314 --> 00:13:12,503
Oh, cool.

291
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,559
A dark basement.

292
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:17,334
I was just thinking we should be
doing this in a dark basement.

293
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:20,134
Troy, why did you
ditch your costume?

294
00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:23,480
Why bring that up now,
Abed? We might die down here.

295
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,280
All the more reason
to get this ironed out.

296
00:13:25,432 --> 00:13:28,162
You called me a nerd up there.
What defines a nerd...

297
00:13:28,163 --> 00:13:29,877
committing to an awesome
Halloween costume

298
00:13:29,878 --> 00:13:30,828
with your best friend?

299
00:13:30,829 --> 00:13:31,741
Is that what nerds do?

300
00:13:31,742 --> 00:13:33,740
I don't know, Abed,
because I'm not a nerd,

301
00:13:33,741 --> 00:13:36,513
which is why I'm not taking
part in this very conversation.

302
00:13:36,514 --> 00:13:37,698
Shh! Nerds.

303
00:13:38,581 --> 00:13:39,712
Did you hear that?

304
00:13:42,658 --> 00:13:43,728
Jeez!

305
00:13:46,302 --> 00:13:47,788
It was just a cat.

306
00:13:47,811 --> 00:13:48,926
Let's keep moving.

307
00:13:50,624 --> 00:13:52,861
Oh! Holy crap!

308
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:59,158
What is up with that cat?

309
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:01,482
- Is someone throwing it?
- Let's keep moving.

310
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:02,731
No!

311
00:14:02,732 --> 00:14:04,287
Let's not keep moving,

312
00:14:04,288 --> 00:14:06,722
because there is an
insane cat down here.

313
00:14:06,723 --> 00:14:08,026
Well, what about the zombies?

314
00:14:08,027 --> 00:14:10,614
Back burner, Troy!
This cat has to be dealt with.

315
00:14:10,762 --> 00:14:12,813
There it is! Grab it!

316
00:14:16,417 --> 00:14:18,013
This should lead upstairs.
The thermostat will be...

317
00:14:18,014 --> 00:14:19,824
enough with the
thermostat, Abed.

318
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:22,687
This is not pretend play time,
save-the-world time.

319
00:14:22,688 --> 00:14:23,758
It's quarter past

320
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:26,909
let's-get-the-hell-
out-of-this-building time.

321
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,019
There. There's a window.

322
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:31,740
All right, if we climb
that dusty fence,

323
00:14:31,741 --> 00:14:32,759
we can hoist each
other against he wall

324
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,018
and then squeeze through it.

325
00:14:36,046 --> 00:14:37,275
I vote we take the door.

326
00:14:38,366 --> 00:14:39,793
He doesn't want
to dirty his suit.

327
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:41,790
For real?

328
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,389
Clothes make the man, Troy.

329
00:14:43,546 --> 00:14:45,477
What the... hey! Ah!

330
00:14:45,564 --> 00:14:46,622
Whoa!

331
00:14:50,053 --> 00:14:51,590
That's my jacket!

332
00:14:52,819 --> 00:14:55,019
My jacket... you're stretching it!

333
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,495
You're stretching it!

334
00:14:58,744 --> 00:15:01,506
Wrong way! Go! Go! Go! Go!

335
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,050
- Go.
- I'm not going without you!

336
00:15:33,051 --> 00:15:34,897
Troy, make me proud.

337
00:15:34,898 --> 00:15:36,956
Be the first black man
to make it to the end.

338
00:15:40,188 --> 00:15:41,334
Go, go, go, go, go!

339
00:15:43,713 --> 00:15:44,528
Abed!

340
00:15:47,497 --> 00:15:48,561
I love you.

341
00:15:48,593 --> 00:15:49,638
I know.

342
00:15:52,046 --> 00:15:52,900
Make it fast.

343
00:15:52,901 --> 00:15:54,547
No!

344
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:09,684
Troy, be honest.

345
00:16:09,685 --> 00:16:11,698
Are you a zombie? I will mace you.

346
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:12,895
Give me the keys.

347
00:16:12,993 --> 00:16:14,156
Those people are gonna
get brain damage

348
00:16:14,157 --> 00:16:15,387
if someone doesn't help 'em.

349
00:16:15,388 --> 00:16:17,119
Okay, Troy,
there is something called

350
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,762
"chain of command,
" so unfortunately...

351
00:16:18,763 --> 00:16:19,731
oh!

352
00:16:22,709 --> 00:16:24,016
Are you crazy?

353
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,246
How are you gonna
survive those zombies?

354
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,149
I'm gonna be a nerd.

355
00:16:30,941 --> 00:16:32,762
Better have a plan "b"!

356
00:16:42,154 --> 00:16:43,173
That's right.

357
00:16:43,776 --> 00:16:46,407
Prepare to meet the
power of imagination.

358
00:16:50,211 --> 00:16:51,548
Ugh! Okay.

359
00:16:51,608 --> 00:16:53,468
All right, I don't know why
I thought this would work.

360
00:16:53,469 --> 00:16:54,936
Hey, get off me!

361
00:16:54,937 --> 00:16:57,001
Get off... you're so strong!

362
00:16:57,382 --> 00:16:58,543
God, I hate this!

363
00:16:59,044 --> 00:16:59,617
Get off!

364
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:01,106
Stop using your mouth!

365
00:17:03,937 --> 00:17:05,022
Hello, zombie Annie.

366
00:17:05,088 --> 00:17:06,523
What big fists you have...

367
00:17:06,524 --> 00:17:07,872
In your face!

368
00:17:09,014 --> 00:17:09,821
Whoa!

369
00:17:11,956 --> 00:17:13,314
Beam this up, Scotty.

370
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:14,772
In your face!

371
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:20,629
Zombie Shirley...

372
00:17:20,822 --> 00:17:22,400
I don't know what you are, but...

373
00:17:22,401 --> 00:17:23,909
in your face!

374
00:17:25,851 --> 00:17:28,492
Abed, we're friends.

375
00:17:28,978 --> 00:17:30,560
Ah! Abed, no!

376
00:17:30,672 --> 00:17:31,994
Ah, Britta!

377
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,483
Okay, okay.

378
00:17:34,484 --> 00:17:35,837
I've been bit, y'all.

379
00:17:35,838 --> 00:17:37,702
Dag. Congrats.

380
00:17:37,703 --> 00:17:39,180
You did what the zombies do.

381
00:17:51,527 --> 00:17:54,592
Jeff, still cool as a zombie.

382
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:56,549
Mah!

383
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,292
Out of the way! Out of the way!

384
00:19:04,293 --> 00:19:05,345
Out of the way!

385
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:10,355
- You dean Pelton?
- Speaking.

386
00:19:10,726 --> 00:19:12,773
Wow. Six hours on the dot.

387
00:19:12,774 --> 00:19:14,580
Yeah, well,
practice makes perfect.

388
00:19:14,657 --> 00:19:15,781
You the only witness?

389
00:19:15,782 --> 00:19:16,937
I am.

390
00:19:17,178 --> 00:19:18,208
All right.

391
00:19:18,313 --> 00:19:20,317
Hey, we got uninfected in here.

392
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:21,577
How many we talking?

393
00:19:22,007 --> 00:19:23,346
I think it might be all of 'em.

394
00:19:24,103 --> 00:19:25,867
All right, scenario "b."

395
00:19:25,868 --> 00:19:27,211
Repeat, scenario "b."

396
00:19:27,514 --> 00:19:29,152
Let's dose these suckers.

397
00:19:29,153 --> 00:19:31,146
Dose what now? Oh!

398
00:19:48,177 --> 00:19:51,495
So you remember nothing past
your decision to be lady gaga?

399
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:54,439
Can't believe that
somebody would mass-roofie

400
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,096
an entire party.

401
00:19:56,097 --> 00:19:57,523
I can't believe it wasn't me.

402
00:19:57,524 --> 00:19:59,060
I can't believe I believe you...

403
00:19:59,443 --> 00:20:00,636
And I don't.

404
00:20:02,007 --> 00:20:03,239
Want to watch a movie?

405
00:20:03,613 --> 00:20:04,612
Sure.

406
00:20:04,713 --> 00:20:06,627
Aliens, cyborgs, or zombies?

407
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,681
I don't know why,
but I'm kind of over zombies.

408
00:20:09,682 --> 00:20:12,339
Yeah, I don't feel like
anything action-heavy.

409
00:20:12,668 --> 00:20:13,800
How about something light?

410
00:20:13,801 --> 00:20:14,950
You seen Marmaduke?

411
00:20:14,951 --> 00:20:18,339
And so Troy and Abed
went back to the dormitory

412
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,786
for a viewing of Marmaduke.

413
00:20:20,994 --> 00:20:24,159
I'm George Takei,
and if you're name is Kevin,

414
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,888
here's a little freebie
for your cell phone.

415
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:29,383
Hi, Kevin can't come to the phone.

416
00:20:29,384 --> 00:20:32,315
He's on a spaceship with me,
George Takei.

417
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:33,963
Please leave a message.

418
00:20:34,156 --> 00:20:35,913
You're welcome Kevins.

419
00:20:37,212 --> 00:20:39,147
Happy Halloween.

420
00:20:43,224 --> 00:20:44,118
Voice mail?

421
00:20:47,171 --> 00:20:49,372
Troy! This is Chang.

422
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:50,825
There's not much time.

423
00:20:50,987 --> 00:20:52,416
I don't think we're gonna make it.

424
00:20:52,564 --> 00:20:54,812
Listen, if you survive,

425
00:20:54,858 --> 00:20:57,646
please spread this message for me.

426
00:20:58,065 --> 00:21:00,447
Shirley and I totally did it!

427
00:21:00,448 --> 00:21:01,751
Shh! Chang, what are you doing?

428
00:21:01,752 --> 00:21:02,703
Nothing.

429
00:21:03,974 --> 00:21:04,926
Gotta go!

430
00:21:08,111 --> 00:21:09,847
Why did he call me?

431
00:21:10,047 --> 00:21:20,247
