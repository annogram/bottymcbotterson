1
00:00:02,796 --> 00:00:05,560
This is Russell Borchert,
computer genius...

2
00:00:05,716 --> 00:00:07,803
...anti-deodorant activist,
and millionaire.

3
00:00:07,968 --> 00:00:11,231
He was rich for having invented
the nine-track cassette...

4
00:00:11,388 --> 00:00:14,651
...which the eight-track industry
paid to keep quiet.

5
00:00:14,808 --> 00:00:18,023
He funnelled that wealth into
a computer school called Greendale...

6
00:00:18,187 --> 00:00:20,488
...where he obsessively pursued
a new project...

7
00:00:20,647 --> 00:00:23,495
...a machine that can process feelings.

8
00:00:24,485 --> 00:00:27,831
He apparently used nothing but gold
to assemble his circuitry...

9
00:00:27,988 --> 00:00:30,788
...believing it to be a better conductor
of human emotion.

10
00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:33,500
It was a weird time.
The Bionic Woman won an Emmy.

11
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,840
Rumours spread about his relationship
with computers...

12
00:00:36,997 --> 00:00:39,002
...and one day, he disappeared.

13
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:41,966
Hence the legend that he died
of the first computer virus.

14
00:00:42,127 --> 00:00:44,298
The city bought the campus,
and life went on.

15
00:00:44,463 --> 00:00:47,844
His body was never found,
nor was his immense wealth.

16
00:00:48,008 --> 00:00:52,101
Some people said he hid his money
using a portal to another dimension.

17
00:00:52,262 --> 00:00:53,816
Those people were on LSD.

18
00:00:53,972 --> 00:00:57,187
Everyone else said
he had a secret vault in his office.

19
00:00:57,684 --> 00:00:59,524
Well, where is his office?

20
00:00:59,686 --> 00:01:00,778
Good question.

21
00:01:00,938 --> 00:01:04,651
We found this confession
written by Greendale's first dean.

22
00:01:04,817 --> 00:01:07,865
"To protect the student health
and the school's reputation...

23
00:01:08,028 --> 00:01:10,792
...I have sealed off
the Computer Department...

24
00:01:10,948 --> 00:01:13,167
...and removed the stairwell
to that section."

25
00:01:13,325 --> 00:01:16,255
Section that remains on this campus,
its secrets untouched...

26
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:18,084
...including possibly Borchert's millions.

27
00:01:18,247 --> 00:01:21,758
If we found it we could buy it
from the city before Subway.

28
00:01:21,917 --> 00:01:24,052
Then I could really go nuts
with this place.

29
00:01:24,211 --> 00:01:26,263
This adventure I usually have
to force upon us.

30
00:01:26,421 --> 00:01:28,925
It is falling into our laps.
We're like the Goonies.

31
00:01:29,091 --> 00:01:32,852
- Except our story tracks logically.
- And we're not talking over each other.

32
00:01:33,011 --> 00:01:35,645
- Everyone talks at the same time. Sorry.
- Can you stop?

33
00:01:35,806 --> 00:01:37,893
Here are your blueprints.
Sorry it took long.

34
00:01:38,058 --> 00:01:42,318
- You can't fight city hall.
- You can. That's why it took so long.

35
00:01:43,313 --> 00:01:46,196
- I'll be damned. Will you look at that?
- It's so clear now.

36
00:01:46,358 --> 00:01:48,577
The entire school
is shaped like a penis.

37
00:01:48,735 --> 00:01:52,532
No, that. It says right here that
this stairway leads to sublevel three.

38
00:01:52,698 --> 00:01:54,584
Is that where the teachers' lounge is?

39
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,087
What the hell does your penis
look like?

40
00:01:57,244 --> 00:02:00,423
Obviously a cluster of buildings.
Let's have a laugh at the freak.

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,074

42
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,653
Missing stairwell would be in this area.
Eyes peeled.

43
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:34,283
Serial killers and people that
hide treasure leave weird little clues.

44
00:02:34,448 --> 00:02:37,461
Check it out. Look at the bottle
held by the school's first...

45
00:02:37,618 --> 00:02:40,252
...and least acceptable mascot,
Big Chief Drunky.

46
00:02:40,412 --> 00:02:42,464
X marks the spot, baby.

47
00:02:42,623 --> 00:02:45,257
Hey, Hickey, maybe you shouldn't be...

48
00:02:45,417 --> 00:02:47,090
Okay.

49
00:02:48,754 --> 00:02:50,973
- Shirley, will you lock the door?
- Okay.

50
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:02,904
There you go.

51
00:03:04,311 --> 00:03:05,984
It's just a bunch of wires.

52
00:03:06,146 --> 00:03:08,234
Exactly what they want us to think.

53
00:03:11,068 --> 00:03:12,325
Oh, my God.

54
00:03:13,237 --> 00:03:14,494
Wait, wait, wait!

55
00:03:14,655 --> 00:03:16,826
The sparks may be spelling out
the next clue.

56
00:03:19,326 --> 00:03:20,963
Jeff, do something.

57
00:03:27,042 --> 00:03:28,086
Is Duncan okay?

58
00:03:28,252 --> 00:03:32,344
He'll live, but his food's gonna taste
like burnt aluminium for a while.

59
00:03:32,506 --> 00:03:33,977
It's pronounced "aluminium."

60
00:03:34,133 --> 00:03:35,307
See, he's fine.

61
00:03:35,467 --> 00:03:37,353
Okay, guys, stop it. Now.

62
00:03:37,511 --> 00:03:41,189
Nobody wants to admit it's over,
but come on.

63
00:03:41,348 --> 00:03:43,567
Oh, look, it's Jeff Winger, fun police...

64
00:03:43,809 --> 00:03:45,481
...here to pull over our smiles...

65
00:03:45,644 --> 00:03:47,649
...because our mouths
have tinted windows.

66
00:03:47,813 --> 00:03:49,783
- Britta and I are getting married.
- What?

67
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,870
Married? Well, you're gonna need
way more doves than this.

68
00:03:53,026 --> 00:03:56,040
What does this look like,
an hour-long episode of The Office?

69
00:03:56,196 --> 00:03:58,996
There's pick-axing
and electric zapping.

70
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:02,337
Don't even acknowledge it.
We are not acknowledging this.

71
00:04:02,494 --> 00:04:04,582
You guys are ridiculous together.

72
00:04:04,746 --> 00:04:06,633
We're ridiculous?
What do you call this?

73
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:07,834
Secret trapdoor!

74
00:04:15,716 --> 00:04:19,726
- Who's got rope?
- I'm offended by that question.

75
00:04:23,015 --> 00:04:26,229
Richie and Carl from the school board.
That's right. We got names.

76
00:04:26,393 --> 00:04:27,734
Open this door now.

77
00:04:27,895 --> 00:04:30,279
- Wait, I know where the keys are.
- You hear that?

78
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:33,867
When we get in there,
you're gonna be in big trouble.

79
00:04:34,026 --> 00:04:36,362
Here they are. Here they are.

80
00:04:36,528 --> 00:04:39,246
- Which one is it?
- Well, it's never the first one...

81
00:04:39,406 --> 00:04:42,087
- ...so we can cancel this one out.
- Come on.

82
00:04:42,242 --> 00:04:45,457
I guess now this is the first one,
so it should be the next one.

83
00:04:45,621 --> 00:04:48,338
- Oh, damn.
- You know what? I got it.

84
00:04:48,707 --> 00:04:50,677
- Get out of the way.
- Richie, be careful.

85
00:04:50,834 --> 00:04:53,515
Don't worry. I've been drinking.

86
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,595
Oh, hello. Would you like some tea?

87
00:04:59,092 --> 00:05:00,433
The tea is swell.

88
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,899
Do you think they can hea...?

89
00:05:10,646 --> 00:05:11,939
I think that...

90
00:05:12,105 --> 00:05:13,826
Oh, come on.

91
00:05:15,526 --> 00:05:17,447
You know it's just as loud as...

92
00:05:21,073 --> 00:05:23,292
Everybody, shut up!

93
00:05:25,953 --> 00:05:28,883
Guys, I think this is the lost section
of Greendale.

94
00:05:29,373 --> 00:05:31,259
Nobody's been in here since the '70s.

95
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:33,504
- How do you know?
- The debate team topic is:

96
00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:35,970
"Who's hotter,
Elliott Gould or Donald Sutherland?"

97
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,300
- Donald Sutherland.
- Donald Sutherland.

98
00:05:42,928 --> 00:05:44,933
- Scary.
- Oh, relax.

99
00:05:45,097 --> 00:05:47,814
If it's like a regular dungeon,
it's only as dangerous...

100
00:05:47,975 --> 00:05:49,232
...as whoever invited you.

101
00:05:49,393 --> 00:05:52,987
Abed, if there's killer robots down here,
you'll tell them we're on your side.

102
00:05:53,147 --> 00:05:55,827
Won't know them from ordinary robots
until they kill us.

103
00:05:55,983 --> 00:05:57,952
Well, what do we do now?

104
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,329
Split up.
Leave no '70s reference unturned.

105
00:06:00,487 --> 00:06:05,126
This decade's out of my wheelhouse.
Pet Rock, leave no Pet Rock unturned.

106
00:06:05,284 --> 00:06:06,790
Let me lead. My light's better.

107
00:06:06,952 --> 00:06:09,538
You're that insecure
that your light has to be better?

108
00:06:09,705 --> 00:06:11,591
- Shut up.
- You shut up.

109
00:06:11,748 --> 00:06:12,959
Anything in there?

110
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:16,637
It's just spider webs
and beanbag chairs.

111
00:06:16,795 --> 00:06:19,299
Don't cry. The importance
of lumbar support hadn't...

112
00:06:19,465 --> 00:06:20,852
It's not that. It's just...

113
00:06:21,008 --> 00:06:24,685
Even if we do save Greendale,
which Greendale will we be saving?

114
00:06:24,845 --> 00:06:27,348
I mean, first Pierce dies,
then Troy leaves.

115
00:06:27,514 --> 00:06:29,685
- Now people are...
- Getting married?

116
00:06:30,517 --> 00:06:32,605
Annie, look, I don't know people.

117
00:06:32,769 --> 00:06:36,068
But I know TV. When characters
feel the show they're on is ending...

118
00:06:36,231 --> 00:06:38,319
...their instinct is to spin off
into something safer.

119
00:06:38,484 --> 00:06:39,824
In Jeff and Britta's case...

120
00:06:39,985 --> 00:06:42,666
...something that'd
last six episodes, have bickering...

121
00:06:42,821 --> 00:06:45,122
...starring them
and an equally WASP-y couple...

122
00:06:45,282 --> 00:06:48,461
...with a title like "Better With
My Worse Half" or "Tying the Not."

123
00:06:48,619 --> 00:06:51,299
"Knot" is spelled without a K.
Or #CouplePeopleProblems.

124
00:06:51,455 --> 00:06:54,219
- Every episode, you decide who has...
- Stop developing.

125
00:06:54,374 --> 00:06:55,585
Sorry.

126
00:06:56,293 --> 00:07:01,845
The point is, this show, Annie,
it isn't just their show.

127
00:07:02,007 --> 00:07:06,397
This is our show, and it's not over.
And the sooner we find that treasure...

128
00:07:06,553 --> 00:07:08,855
...the faster the Jeff-Britta pilot
falls apart.

129
00:07:09,014 --> 00:07:10,272
Got it.

130
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:11,726
Thank you, Abed.

131
00:07:11,892 --> 00:07:13,731
You're welcome.

132
00:07:15,395 --> 00:07:17,198
- I have a girlfriend.
- What?

133
00:07:17,356 --> 00:07:20,239
- You were about to start a kiss lean.
- I was not.

134
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,741
Fine. Let's find treasure.

135
00:07:25,197 --> 00:07:26,585
- Did you find anything?
- No.

136
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,911
We've searched every crevice
of this place...

137
00:07:29,076 --> 00:07:31,875
...and the only treasures we've found
are this CB radio...

138
00:07:32,037 --> 00:07:34,623
...these basketball cards
with white people on them...

139
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:37,803
...and this little rocket launcher
from some action figure.

140
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:42,267
It seems like an odd place
for a dead end though.

141
00:07:42,422 --> 00:07:43,680
It could be a secret door.

142
00:07:43,841 --> 00:07:45,928
Maybe the jukebox is the key to it.

143
00:07:46,093 --> 00:07:48,810
Just remember, it's okay if we fail.

144
00:07:48,971 --> 00:07:50,394
- Right, Jeff?
- That's right.

145
00:07:52,891 --> 00:07:55,774
Try every button.
Just try every single button ever.

146
00:07:58,897 --> 00:08:02,445
- Are you all right?
- No! I was dying!

147
00:08:03,694 --> 00:08:04,951
Try track 127.

148
00:08:05,112 --> 00:08:09,204
Right. Because 127 in binary code
would be a palindrome.

149
00:08:09,366 --> 00:08:12,629
Because the song title
is "Open the Door" by the Secret Doors.

150
00:08:34,475 --> 00:08:36,978
Borchert's secret lab.

151
00:08:37,144 --> 00:08:39,991
That's the machine Borchert
was working on in the film.

152
00:08:44,443 --> 00:08:46,993
Borchert's gold.

153
00:08:48,113 --> 00:08:49,750
We need to get this upstairs.

154
00:08:49,907 --> 00:08:51,081
Save Greendale.

155
00:08:56,455 --> 00:08:58,425
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

156
00:09:00,292 --> 00:09:02,048
You're Russell Borchert, aren't you?

157
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:06,183
Okay, I'm gonna peel off
some Band-Aids here.

158
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,514
Dennis Hopper is dead.

159
00:09:08,425 --> 00:09:11,011
TV shows give no time
for theme songs anymore.

160
00:09:11,178 --> 00:09:14,809
And Woody Allen did the voice
of a cartoon ant.

161
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,528
Jeff!

162
00:09:21,688 --> 00:09:25,532
Sorry, I lose track
of how big I'm getting.

163
00:09:25,692 --> 00:09:26,866
I don't.

164
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:32,040
You vandalize private property,
you nearly destroy the school...

165
00:09:32,199 --> 00:09:34,334
...when it's finally about to make
a profit?

166
00:09:34,493 --> 00:09:35,703
You guys are the worst...

167
00:09:35,869 --> 00:09:38,550
...with your stupid paintballs
and your freeze tags.

168
00:09:38,705 --> 00:09:42,004
- Hot Lava.
- That was Hot Lava? Dumb.

169
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,382
Tell us where the others went.

170
00:09:47,381 --> 00:09:49,018
Guys, guys.

171
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,094
What do you wanna do?

172
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,387
What should we do?

173
00:09:52,553 --> 00:09:54,309
Well, what can we do?

174
00:09:55,848 --> 00:09:57,568
Okay.

175
00:09:57,808 --> 00:10:00,358
I'm gonna need you guys
to stay back...

176
00:10:00,602 --> 00:10:03,236
...and never tell anyone
about what you saw here today.

177
00:10:19,329 --> 00:10:21,915
You're special, Richie.
Your mind is special.

178
00:10:22,082 --> 00:10:24,586
You know it works differently
from other kids' minds.

179
00:10:24,751 --> 00:10:28,050
Richie's a freak, Richie's a freak.

180
00:10:35,304 --> 00:10:36,347
Thank you.

181
00:10:36,889 --> 00:10:38,016
I know where they went.

182
00:10:38,557 --> 00:10:41,440
They climbed out to the roof,
hopped on a hang glider...

183
00:10:41,602 --> 00:10:45,196
...and flew it across town
to that Greek restaurant. Papa Cristo's?

184
00:10:45,981 --> 00:10:47,737
I robbed your brain.

185
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,287
I robbed it.

186
00:10:49,443 --> 00:10:52,622
Hey, we found a hatch in the floor
underneath the vending machine.

187
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:55,710
- I think they went down inside it.
- Was there a hang glider?

188
00:10:58,285 --> 00:11:00,456
You're gonna find
a hang glider down there.

189
00:11:00,621 --> 00:11:01,914
That much I know.

190
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,628
So anyway, I sealed myself up
down here with 50 years of food...

191
00:11:05,793 --> 00:11:08,676
...50 years of toilet paper,
and 50 years of cocaine...

192
00:11:08,837 --> 00:11:11,423
...which I somehow ran out of
after about 10 years.

193
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,644
The '80s happened down here too.

194
00:11:13,801 --> 00:11:16,137
Yeah. Hey.
What are you doing with Raquel?

195
00:11:16,303 --> 00:11:18,640
Raquel.

196
00:11:18,806 --> 00:11:21,819
We're on a deadline,
and to put it bluntly, we need your gold.

197
00:11:21,975 --> 00:11:23,233
Raquel!

198
00:11:23,393 --> 00:11:27,237
- Guys, a little help. Scary fingernails?
- I'm almost done. She needs more time.

199
00:11:27,397 --> 00:11:29,367
Sir, Raquel has taken the best years of
your life...

200
00:11:29,525 --> 00:11:31,197
...and a dozen of your not-so-good.

201
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,658
If she hasn't given anything back,
it might be time to move on.

202
00:11:36,782 --> 00:11:39,119
Stop! You guys...

203
00:11:39,618 --> 00:11:40,662
...what are we doing?

204
00:11:40,828 --> 00:11:42,667
- Saving Greendale.
- From what?

205
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:46,922
We were driven down here by sellouts
with crappy values.

206
00:11:47,084 --> 00:11:51,260
Since when do human beings decide
which dreams are worthwhile?

207
00:11:51,421 --> 00:11:52,465
Look at him.

208
00:11:53,173 --> 00:11:54,763
He's one of us.

209
00:11:54,925 --> 00:11:58,603
We have to respect each other
enough...

210
00:11:59,513 --> 00:12:02,147
...to let each other want
what we want...

211
00:12:02,933 --> 00:12:07,026
...no matter how transparently
self-destructive...

212
00:12:07,187 --> 00:12:11,494
...or empty our desires may be.

213
00:12:12,818 --> 00:12:15,701
If it was money that you guys wanted,
why didn't you say so?

214
00:12:15,863 --> 00:12:19,161
You can just have my leftover cash
that's under the desk over there.

215
00:12:19,324 --> 00:12:22,373
I don't think it's worth much.
Those are Gerald Ford dollars.

216
00:12:22,828 --> 00:12:24,999
- How many?
- Couple of million.

217
00:12:25,164 --> 00:12:27,548
Back in the '70s,
that was worth millions.

218
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:28,799
Hey, I've got an idea.

219
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,802
How about you people leave me alone
and I hereby grant that to Greendale?

220
00:12:34,882 --> 00:12:36,554
- What?
- Oh, my God!

221
00:12:36,717 --> 00:12:38,638
- Glad to hear it.
- What?

222
00:12:41,763 --> 00:12:43,733
Get back. This pickle's a magnet.

223
00:12:44,558 --> 00:12:47,322
- I'll wipe her out, man.
- Don't you dare use that on her!

224
00:12:47,478 --> 00:12:50,325
- See what magnets do to computers?
- No, don't do it!

225
00:12:50,481 --> 00:12:52,320
Get over there with them.

226
00:12:52,483 --> 00:12:54,322
You have no legal claim to that money.

227
00:12:54,485 --> 00:12:58,411
Take it up with Subway in about an hour,
after close of escrow.

228
00:12:58,572 --> 00:13:00,411
Chang,
you've become a bad guy again?

229
00:13:00,574 --> 00:13:03,706
There's a lot more to it than that, Britta.

230
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,755
Wait, I'm not wearing a mask?

231
00:13:07,915 --> 00:13:10,418
There's no more to it.
I think I'm just mentally ill.

232
00:13:10,584 --> 00:13:12,885
All right, just stay back. All right?

233
00:13:14,546 --> 00:13:15,887
No, don't.

234
00:13:18,258 --> 00:13:20,061
No!

235
00:13:21,094 --> 00:13:23,147
Oh, God, no.

236
00:13:26,308 --> 00:13:27,566
- Hey, stop!
- Hang in there.

237
00:13:27,726 --> 00:13:30,941
- Open it!
- Raquel is the main operating system.

238
00:13:31,104 --> 00:13:35,411
She controls the door, the lights,
the shower probably, everything.

239
00:13:35,567 --> 00:13:38,830
And now she's dead.

240
00:13:40,113 --> 00:13:42,699
So we're trapped in here forever.

241
00:13:43,116 --> 00:13:45,453
Or just until we run out of food
and water.

242
00:13:45,619 --> 00:13:49,297
- At least we'll have each other.
- Till death do us part.

243
00:13:50,123 --> 00:13:52,804
You know what?
You guys can have my food and water.

244
00:13:55,629 --> 00:13:56,970
Come on, Raquel.

245
00:13:57,131 --> 00:13:58,174
Come on.

246
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,226
Baby. Come on.

247
00:14:03,137 --> 00:14:06,483
Oh, thank God. Her emotional
components are still online.

248
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,767
Emotional components?

249
00:14:07,933 --> 00:14:12,192
I have accomplished things down here
you couldn't even possibly imagine.

250
00:14:12,354 --> 00:14:14,988
Here, let me show you.

251
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,260
Right there. That was it, that was it.
Did you see it?

252
00:14:34,543 --> 00:14:37,640
Don't you see?
This computer responds to feelings.

253
00:14:38,172 --> 00:14:39,762
When I started Greendale...

254
00:14:39,923 --> 00:14:43,850
...it was for ordinary people
to be able to access technology.

255
00:14:44,011 --> 00:14:47,225
Wait, you started Greendale?
Do you have that in writing, anywhere?

256
00:14:47,431 --> 00:14:49,934
I don't know.
Somewhere with all that crap over there.

257
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,903
But without an emotional component...

258
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,529
...computers would strip us
of all humanity...

259
00:14:54,688 --> 00:14:58,200
...and create a society
with emotionless eggheads at the top...

260
00:14:58,358 --> 00:15:00,410
...and idiots with feelings at the bottom.

261
00:15:00,569 --> 00:15:04,247
And I refuse to let that happen,
and that's why I've spent... What?

262
00:15:04,406 --> 00:15:06,542
- What is that?
- It's a video of a kitten.

263
00:15:07,618 --> 00:15:09,705
And why are those people
arguing about it?

264
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:10,914
And what's that?

265
00:15:11,705 --> 00:15:14,339
An emoticon. That person wants
to indicate happiness...

266
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,426
...but can't convey it with language, so
they misuse punctuation to form a smile.

267
00:15:19,671 --> 00:15:21,807
That is so...

268
00:15:22,966 --> 00:15:24,354
Stupid.

269
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:27,060
Only an idiot would think of this.

270
00:15:27,221 --> 00:15:29,724
Idiots won!

271
00:15:30,557 --> 00:15:33,690
Which means my work down here
is done.

272
00:15:33,852 --> 00:15:35,655
Good. According to what I'm seeing...

273
00:15:35,813 --> 00:15:39,739
...if we can get you up there right now,
Subway won't be buying this school.

274
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,157
What?

275
00:15:41,318 --> 00:15:42,576
What?

276
00:15:42,736 --> 00:15:45,750
Yeah, but it's gonna take a few hours
to get that door open...

277
00:15:45,906 --> 00:15:49,085
...because Raquel's
logic circuits... not good.

278
00:15:49,243 --> 00:15:50,714
Her emotional components work.

279
00:15:50,869 --> 00:15:52,210
Well, in theory...

280
00:15:52,371 --> 00:15:57,259
...a blast of human passion could shock
the mainframe into a cold start...

281
00:15:57,417 --> 00:15:59,588
...but that's only
if somebody in this room...

282
00:15:59,753 --> 00:16:02,850
...has feelings stronger than I get
when I rub my nipples...

283
00:16:03,006 --> 00:16:05,771
- ...so good luck with that, folks.
- Give me that.

284
00:16:06,677 --> 00:16:08,931
Everybody over there. Turn around.

285
00:16:09,096 --> 00:16:11,267
Turn around now.

286
00:16:13,684 --> 00:16:15,605
You're here to save me, aren't you?

287
00:16:17,271 --> 00:16:19,442
Let's get out of here
and never look back.

288
00:16:21,108 --> 00:16:23,789
In case you have to remember me,
can I give you quotes?

289
00:16:23,944 --> 00:16:25,118
Shut up, Abed.

290
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,619
- Milady.
- Milord.

291
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:40,092
- What did you do?
- Don't worry about it. Let's go.

292
00:16:46,758 --> 00:16:51,018
The city of Greendale is proud
to be selling the school of Greendale...

293
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,223
...to Subway.

294
00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:56,482
This brings to an end
several years of horrible management...

295
00:16:56,643 --> 00:16:59,028
...by Dean Craig Isidore Pelton...

296
00:16:59,188 --> 00:17:01,323
...not to throw anyone under the bus.

297
00:17:01,482 --> 00:17:03,154
- No.
- But he'd be the one.

298
00:17:03,317 --> 00:17:09,165
By my watch, it is about time to sign
these documents and make it official.

299
00:17:09,323 --> 00:17:10,960
Objection.

300
00:17:11,116 --> 00:17:13,335
I teach law at Greendale,
so believe me...

301
00:17:13,494 --> 00:17:15,333
...I don't know much about law...

302
00:17:15,496 --> 00:17:18,260
...but I do know a contract violation
when I see one.

303
00:17:18,415 --> 00:17:20,669
This is a legitimate transaction...

304
00:17:20,834 --> 00:17:23,338
...where a city is selling a school
to a restaurant.

305
00:17:23,504 --> 00:17:25,805
It happens somewhere every day.

306
00:17:25,964 --> 00:17:28,550
Oh, the city can sell the school
all it wants...

307
00:17:28,717 --> 00:17:31,268
...but according to his contract
with the city...

308
00:17:31,428 --> 00:17:35,438
...the school's original founder
retains the privilege of consultation...

309
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:38,696
...on all future scholastic endeavours
taking place here.

310
00:17:38,852 --> 00:17:41,356
So Subway Sandwich University...

311
00:17:41,522 --> 00:17:44,784
...meet your new vice dean,
Russell Borchert.

312
00:17:56,745 --> 00:17:57,789
Hi.

313
00:17:57,955 --> 00:17:59,545
I guess we're gonna be partners.

314
00:17:59,706 --> 00:18:01,509
I understand there's some Internet...

315
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:04,384
...where I can make
my inner thoughts public.

316
00:18:04,545 --> 00:18:06,716
Greendale the city
and Greendale the school...

317
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,226
...have some stuff to sort out,
and Subway doesn't do conflict.

318
00:18:10,384 --> 00:18:12,638
We do good food at good prices.

319
00:18:12,803 --> 00:18:16,397
We are but simple sandwich artists...

320
00:18:16,557 --> 00:18:20,068
- ...who want the world to eat fresh.
- Eat fresh!

321
00:18:20,227 --> 00:18:22,908
Subway, ho!

322
00:18:28,193 --> 00:18:29,534
Did we just save Greendale?

323
00:18:29,695 --> 00:18:31,996
Did we just save Greendale?

324
00:18:32,156 --> 00:18:34,208
No! No, you did not.

325
00:18:34,366 --> 00:18:37,664
You moved dirt
around Greendale's grave.

326
00:18:37,828 --> 00:18:39,500
Your school is still bankrupt...

327
00:18:39,663 --> 00:18:43,506
...it is still unmarketable, and it is
still on the permanent chopping block...

328
00:18:43,667 --> 00:18:47,428
...of anyone who has any say
in its future.

329
00:18:47,588 --> 00:18:53,105
Yeah? Well, around here,
we call that Wednesday.

330
00:19:08,275 --> 00:19:11,869
Hey, after I was electrocuted, didn't you
two say you were gonna get married?

331
00:19:12,029 --> 00:19:13,950
Doesn't electrocuted
technically mean killed?

332
00:19:14,114 --> 00:19:17,661
- You always have to correct people?
- You always have to police correcting?

333
00:19:17,826 --> 00:19:20,460
- Marriage is off.
- I think you mean the wedding is off.

334
00:19:20,621 --> 00:19:21,664
- Yeah!
- Hey, hey.

335
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:25,971
Hey, I gotta say, you held up well
under that interrogation.

336
00:19:26,126 --> 00:19:29,970
I'm gonna tell you something that
I'd like to stay between us, huh?

337
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:33,642
I was thinking about a hang glider.

338
00:19:34,551 --> 00:19:36,639
None of this conflict truly matters.

339
00:19:36,804 --> 00:19:39,817
The only owners of this land
are the Arapaho.

340
00:19:39,973 --> 00:19:45,063
Would it offend you if I asked you
to train me in the use of certain powers?

341
00:19:46,814 --> 00:19:47,857
Sorry, Carl.

342
00:19:48,023 --> 00:19:49,115
You deserve better.

343
00:19:49,274 --> 00:19:50,995
Chang, you get it.

344
00:19:51,151 --> 00:19:53,488
How would you like a job
on the school board?

345
00:19:53,654 --> 00:19:55,741
- Okay.
- Your first job...

346
00:19:55,906 --> 00:19:58,326
...is to deliver this...

347
00:19:58,492 --> 00:20:01,422
- ...to the City Bursar's Office.
- On it.

348
00:20:03,205 --> 00:20:05,922
Hi, yes, I'd like to replace all my teeth
with diamonds.

349
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,337
We live to fight another day.

350
00:20:08,502 --> 00:20:11,266
I never got a chance
to wish you a happy birthday.

351
00:20:11,421 --> 00:20:13,094
Or Halloween or Christmas...

352
00:20:13,257 --> 00:20:14,929
...or any specific calendar event.

353
00:20:15,092 --> 00:20:17,346
- Well, maybe next year.
- Definitely.

354
00:20:17,511 --> 00:20:19,563
We'll definitely be back next year.

355
00:20:19,721 --> 00:20:23,399
If not, it'll be because an asteroid
has destroyed all human civilisation...

356
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:25,030
...and that's canon.

357
00:20:25,185 --> 00:20:27,356
What? What are you...?

358
00:20:28,689 --> 00:20:30,195
Nothing.

359
00:20:56,383 --> 00:20:58,768
Am I thinking what you're thinking?

360
00:21:02,222 --> 00:21:03,563
Penny for your thoughts.

361
00:21:11,273 --> 00:21:12,863
Intensive Karen.

362
00:21:14,401 --> 00:21:15,493
Mr. Egypt.

363
00:21:17,738 --> 00:21:18,829
Celebrity Beat-Off.

364
00:21:20,073 --> 00:21:22,410
Captain Cook.

365
00:21:25,746 --> 00:21:27,585
Depends on what fails.

366
00:21:28,305 --> 00:21:34,384
