1
00:00:06,037 --> 00:00:07,304
We are so screwed.

2
00:00:07,305 --> 00:00:08,472
How are we gonna
memorize all this?

3
00:00:08,473 --> 00:00:09,706
Let's just go over it again.

4
00:00:09,707 --> 00:00:11,774
Kingdom, phylum, class...

5
00:00:11,775 --> 00:00:14,692
Order, family, genus, species.

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:17,191
I use a mnemonic device.

7
00:00:17,348 --> 00:00:21,184
"Kevin, please come
over for gay sex."

8
00:00:21,185 --> 00:00:23,686
Why wouldn't you use "Karen"?

9
00:00:23,687 --> 00:00:25,255
'Cause it's gay sex, dummy.

10
00:00:25,256 --> 00:00:26,822
So use "great".

11
00:00:26,823 --> 00:00:28,790
Now I can't remember anything.
Thanks!

12
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:30,585
God, why do we always wind up
in this position?

13
00:00:30,616 --> 00:00:32,366
For all the time you spend here,
you'd think we wouldn't

14
00:00:32,395 --> 00:00:33,576
have to cram so much.

15
00:00:33,596 --> 00:00:35,077
Maybe we never get any work
done because we have

16
00:00:35,097 --> 00:00:36,579
so much fun hanging out
together.

17
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,516
Definitely, maybe that's why.

18
00:00:40,371 --> 00:00:45,706
Ah, the duali-Dean of man.

19
00:00:45,707 --> 00:00:48,342
I'm dressed this way because I
have good news and bad news.

20
00:00:48,343 --> 00:00:50,344
You have got to be kidding me.

21
00:00:50,345 --> 00:00:53,314
The bad news is Professor Kane
has the flu.

22
00:00:53,315 --> 00:00:55,816
The good news is biology class
is canceled...

23
00:00:57,686 --> 00:00:58,752
After you.

24
00:00:58,753 --> 00:01:01,521
What a gentleman.

25
00:01:01,522 --> 00:01:04,191
Guys, we don't have to cram
last minute anymore.

26
00:01:04,192 --> 00:01:06,226
Last minute got
moved to tomorrow.

27
00:01:06,227 --> 00:01:08,228
Three-hour lunch? Three-hour
lunch? Three-hour lunch?

28
00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:09,462
Three hours?

29
00:01:09,463 --> 00:01:11,198
I could watch the first half of
three movies.

30
00:01:11,199 --> 00:01:12,532
Ooh, I don't have to go
to the fast food

31
00:01:12,533 --> 00:01:13,667
restaurant across the street.

32
00:01:13,668 --> 00:01:15,068
I can go to the fancy one
across town.

33
00:01:15,069 --> 00:01:16,302
Their manager wears a tie.

34
00:01:16,303 --> 00:01:17,736
If we don't eat, we can
make-believe

35
00:01:17,737 --> 00:01:19,205
an whole episode's worth of
Inspector Spacetime

36
00:01:19,206 --> 00:01:20,606
- in the Dreamatorium.
- Word.

37
00:01:20,607 --> 00:01:22,441
Yeah.

38
00:01:22,442 --> 00:01:24,510
Maybe we should go
to Señor Kevin's.

39
00:01:24,511 --> 00:01:26,512
Britta, didn't you want to try
that new cage-free bean burrito?

40
00:01:26,513 --> 00:01:28,914
The tortillas are made with
micro-financed flour.

41
00:01:28,915 --> 00:01:30,449
Troy, you could drive.

42
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,554
I can't go to Señor Kevin's.
The manager and I are enemies.

43
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:37,888
<i>He said Die Hard was bad.</i>

44
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,257
<i>- He said Die Hard was bad.
- I know, buddy.</i>

45
00:01:39,258 --> 00:01:40,791
Well, how about this.

46
00:01:40,792 --> 00:01:44,061
This lunch is already a runaway
train, no point in stopping it.

47
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:46,331
Troy, Britta, you go
to Señor Kevin's.

48
00:01:46,332 --> 00:01:48,198
Abed promised he'd show me how
the Dreamatorium works.

49
00:01:48,199 --> 00:01:50,100
- Today's the perfect day for it.
- But I want to...

50
00:01:50,101 --> 00:01:51,702
Abed, don't you think today's

51
00:01:51,703 --> 00:01:53,237
- the perfect day for it?
- No.

52
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,706
- Abed.
- Is this a social cue?

53
00:01:55,707 --> 00:01:59,914
<i>I left my Puttin' On the Ritz
cane in here earlier.</i>

54
00:02:00,878 --> 00:02:02,512
I know it probably
has another name,

55
00:02:02,513 --> 00:02:05,781
but, um, can I be perfectly
honest with you guys?

56
00:02:05,782 --> 00:02:07,683
I think I went too
far with this one.

57
00:02:07,684 --> 00:02:11,954
I have to go to the bank today.

58
00:02:11,955 --> 00:02:13,656
What am I supposed to tell
people in line?

59
00:02:13,657 --> 00:02:16,492
"I had good news and bad news"?

60
00:02:16,493 --> 00:02:18,461
Come on, Craig.

61
00:02:18,462 --> 00:02:20,729

69
00:02:53,327 --> 00:02:55,561
I am Inspector Spacetime.

70
00:02:55,562 --> 00:02:57,630
And I know that
which is unknown.

71
00:02:57,631 --> 00:03:01,534
Duty-bound to protect a universe
of innocent unremarkables,

72
00:03:01,535 --> 00:03:04,069
I patrol it
in the x7 Dimensionizer

73
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:06,539
with my loyal constable,
Reggie.

74
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,641
This week, however, Reggie has
been forced to go to lunch.

75
00:03:09,642 --> 00:03:12,944
<i>So I'm aboard the much crappier
H.M.S. Spacetime 12,</i>

76
00:03:12,945 --> 00:03:17,349
from the worst season ever, with
temporary constable, Geneva.

77
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:20,452
Geneva, I need the quantum
spanner, the big one.

78
00:03:20,453 --> 00:03:24,388
Oi, gov'ner, quantum spammer,
up an' at 'em, in'it?

79
00:03:26,925 --> 00:03:28,225
If we can't get out
of orbital lock,

80
00:03:28,226 --> 00:03:29,860
the Blorgons may intercept.

81
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:31,329
Tut tut, m'lord.

82
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:35,232
Wouldn't give a tuppence for
that sticky wicket.

83
00:03:35,233 --> 00:03:37,067
Okay, stop simulation.

84
00:03:37,068 --> 00:03:38,235
More British?

85
00:03:38,236 --> 00:03:40,002
I can't do this anymore.

86
00:03:40,003 --> 00:03:42,171
But the Blo-gons might
intercept...

87
00:03:42,172 --> 00:03:43,606
It's Blorgons with an "r".

88
00:03:43,607 --> 00:03:45,007
Blo-gon means "thank you"
in blorgon.

89
00:03:45,008 --> 00:03:46,876
Can't we play something
I know about

90
00:03:46,877 --> 00:03:49,520
like hospital administration?

91
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:54,951
You're mad at me for playing
matchmaker with Troy and Britta.

92
00:03:54,952 --> 00:03:56,552
You think you're
gonna lose Troy.

93
00:03:56,553 --> 00:03:57,472
I'm not petty, Annie.

94
00:03:57,481 --> 00:03:58,556
I'm mad at you because you
tampered

95
00:03:58,588 --> 00:03:59,738
with the fabric of the group.

96
00:03:59,762 --> 00:04:01,065
How do you know
Troy and Britta pairing up

97
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:02,137
wouldn't destroy everything?

98
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:03,094
I run the scenarios.

99
00:04:03,095 --> 00:04:04,659
I examine this stuff
from every conceivable angle.

100
00:04:04,694 --> 00:04:06,928
Oh, and you can do
that but I can't?

101
00:04:06,929 --> 00:04:09,365
You don't have a patent on being
a control freak, Abed.

102
00:04:09,366 --> 00:04:10,399
I kind of do.

103
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,500
You think this is just a room
where Troy and I play dinosaurs

104
00:04:12,501 --> 00:04:13,868
versus river boat gamblers
together?

105
00:04:13,869 --> 00:04:15,470
Sure, it's how I got
the construction approved,

106
00:04:15,471 --> 00:04:16,804
but, much like myself,

107
00:04:16,805 --> 00:04:18,906
the Dreamatorium
has higher functions.

108
00:04:18,907 --> 00:04:20,561
Would you like me to show you
how your stunt

109
00:04:20,586 --> 00:04:22,030
with Troy and Britta
will play itself out?

110
00:04:22,075 --> 00:04:23,311
Why not?

111
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:25,346
Execute simulation Troy/Britta.

112
00:04:25,347 --> 00:04:29,115
Render environment
Señor Kevin's.

113
00:04:29,116 --> 00:04:30,617
Oh, those appetizers

114
00:04:30,618 --> 00:04:33,487
were dope and legit!

115
00:04:33,488 --> 00:04:34,821
I don't usually support lunch

116
00:04:34,822 --> 00:04:37,591
because it's unfair
to breakfast.

117
00:04:37,592 --> 00:04:38,592
I never thought about

118
00:04:38,593 --> 00:04:41,661
meals fighting each other.

119
00:04:41,662 --> 00:04:43,096
I guess that explains
why you never

120
00:04:43,097 --> 00:04:45,364
see any two of them on
the same table.

121
00:04:45,365 --> 00:04:47,400
So I guess Annie's pretty hot
to get us together.

122
00:04:47,401 --> 00:04:50,369
She probably just doesn't
understand people.

123
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,804
Well, the sooner
the food comes,

124
00:04:51,805 --> 00:04:53,972
the sooner this will be over.

125
00:04:53,973 --> 00:04:57,643
I'm afraid your food won't be
ready for another half hour.

126
00:04:57,644 --> 00:05:01,312
<i>I'm too busy misunderstanding
the whole point of Die Hard.</i>

127
00:05:01,313 --> 00:05:04,348
I can't wait to
get home to Abed.

128
00:05:04,349 --> 00:05:06,551
So you can dart back and forth

129
00:05:06,552 --> 00:05:08,052
doing impressions
of your friends.

130
00:05:08,053 --> 00:05:09,921
There's no science at work here.

131
00:05:09,922 --> 00:05:13,257
You're right.

132
00:05:13,258 --> 00:05:16,192
The science is at work in here.

133
00:05:17,995 --> 00:05:21,197
This is
the Dreamatorium's engine.

134
00:05:21,198 --> 00:05:22,599
My thoughts are collected
by this box

135
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,902
and everything I know about my
friends is stored here.

136
00:05:24,903 --> 00:05:26,269
Both are distilled
by logic and then

137
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,071
recombined into objective
observation.

138
00:05:28,072 --> 00:05:29,740
I'm able to simulate
any of the study group

139
00:05:29,741 --> 00:05:32,942
and even a half-accurate Chang
in over 7,000 unique situations.

140
00:05:32,943 --> 00:05:36,224
Abed, it's cardboard tubes
and a funnel.

141
00:05:36,249 --> 00:05:37,764
Well you see it that way
because it's calibrated

142
00:05:37,781 --> 00:05:39,649
to a specific level
of brain function.

143
00:05:39,905 --> 00:05:41,518
Right. I'm stupid.

144
00:05:41,552 --> 00:05:43,853
Not stupid, just less able to
see what I see.

145
00:05:43,854 --> 00:05:46,923
Gee, you've got it
all figured out.

146
00:05:49,258 --> 00:05:52,026
King of toilet paper rolls
over here.

147
00:05:52,027 --> 00:05:55,797
Hey, Troy, I'm glad you called.

148
00:05:55,798 --> 00:05:56,932
Your lunch is going well, right?

149
00:05:56,933 --> 00:05:58,667
Yeah, just checking on Abed.

150
00:05:58,668 --> 00:06:00,569
Making sure he's okay.

151
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:03,004
What? He's fine.

152
00:06:03,005 --> 00:06:04,905
He just implied I operate
on a lower level

153
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,641
of brain function,
so business as usual.

154
00:06:07,642 --> 00:06:11,144
Great, um, just, you know,
make sure he stays comfortable.

155
00:06:11,145 --> 00:06:12,746
I worry about him
when I'm not around.

156
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:16,884
Well, he's fine,
he always will be.

157
00:06:16,885 --> 00:06:18,853
People bend over backwards to
cater to him.

158
00:06:18,854 --> 00:06:21,554
He's just extra sensitive in
the Dreamatorium.

159
00:06:21,555 --> 00:06:23,623
It takes a lot out of
him to run that thing.

160
00:06:23,624 --> 00:06:25,124
I don't want you to
break his brain.

161
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:26,425
Bye, Troy.

162
00:06:26,426 --> 00:06:29,496
- How is he?
- He'll be okay.

163
00:06:29,497 --> 00:06:31,130
It's so sweet how much you
care about him.

164
00:06:31,131 --> 00:06:34,300
<i>And another thing
I hate about Die Hard,</i>

165
00:06:34,301 --> 00:06:37,235
two FBI agents named Johnson.

166
00:06:39,005 --> 00:06:41,640
I've been thinking about our
Inspector Spacetime scenario.

167
00:06:41,641 --> 00:06:43,742
It might work better if instead
of playing Geneva,

168
00:06:43,743 --> 00:06:44,977
you played Rosamund.

169
00:06:44,978 --> 00:06:46,311
She was a constable
in season five

170
00:06:46,312 --> 00:06:48,480
and she only had three lines.

171
00:06:48,481 --> 00:06:50,081
I have a better idea.

172
00:06:50,082 --> 00:06:52,449
You know what would make your
scenarios a lot more realistic?

173
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:53,618
If Troy weren't on a date.

174
00:06:53,619 --> 00:06:54,919
Why don't you take
all your thoughts

175
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,255
and your logic and add one step
to the process.

176
00:06:58,256 --> 00:06:59,790
- What are you doing?
- From now on,

177
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:01,692
before you do or say anything,

178
00:07:01,693 --> 00:07:04,595
you're gonna think about how it
affects the people around you.

179
00:07:04,596 --> 00:07:07,131
We lower functioning brains call
this "empathy".

180
00:07:10,668 --> 00:07:14,070
Abed?

181
00:07:14,071 --> 00:07:17,674
Abed?

182
00:07:17,675 --> 00:07:19,543
Oh, my God, I broke Abed.

183
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,522
Abed?

184
00:07:24,567 --> 00:07:25,997
You know how you wanted me to
tell you

185
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:28,574
when you were being scary weird
instead of cute weird?

186
00:07:28,632 --> 00:07:31,568
This is scary weird.

187
00:07:33,671 --> 00:07:36,372
Hello, Annie.

188
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:38,575
What was I doing on the floor?

189
00:07:38,576 --> 00:07:40,910
Were we... doing it?

190
00:07:40,911 --> 00:07:43,145
Are you being Jeff?

191
00:07:43,146 --> 00:07:46,414
Well, I'm not
being a Kardashian.

192
00:07:46,415 --> 00:07:47,583
So where are we now?

193
00:07:47,584 --> 00:07:50,786
We're in the doctor's lounge
of Greendale Hospital School.

194
00:07:50,787 --> 00:07:51,854
Hospital school?

195
00:07:51,855 --> 00:07:53,489
It's a sexy emotional school

196
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,290
where doctors save
lives and make love,

197
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:56,525
often simultaneously.

198
00:07:56,526 --> 00:07:58,927
Our stories,
ripped from the headlines.

199
00:07:58,928 --> 00:08:00,761
Our passions, unbridled.

200
00:08:00,762 --> 00:08:03,831
Our cafeteria, eh...

201
00:08:03,832 --> 00:08:05,199
Make love to me, Ann.

202
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,467
I know I'm just a surgeon

203
00:08:06,468 --> 00:08:08,335
and you're a hotshot
upstart administrator,

204
00:08:08,336 --> 00:08:09,904
but damn the rules,
damn the system,

205
00:08:09,905 --> 00:08:12,607
damn our two foot height
disparity, I want you.

206
00:08:12,608 --> 00:08:16,043
Okay, Abed, I get it, we have
different sensibilities.

207
00:08:16,044 --> 00:08:17,978
Later.

208
00:08:20,848 --> 00:08:22,415
Bye.

209
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,350
I'm leaving.

210
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

211
00:08:33,292 --> 00:08:36,094
Okay, Dr. Jeff,

212
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:38,631
can you please tell me
where I can find Abed?

213
00:08:38,632 --> 00:08:39,732
I owe him an apology.

214
00:08:39,733 --> 00:08:42,167
Abed? Never heard of him.

215
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:46,304
Terrific.

216
00:08:46,305 --> 00:08:48,640
I asked you a question, doctor.

217
00:08:48,641 --> 00:08:49,607
I'm a surgeon!

218
00:08:49,608 --> 00:08:51,208
And I'm your administrator!

219
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:53,110
I left my wife for you
and she was pregnant!

220
00:08:53,111 --> 00:08:55,346
Who do you think
inseminated her?

221
00:08:55,347 --> 00:08:57,849
Now tell me what I want to know
or God as my witness,

222
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,183
I'll have your stethoscope.

223
00:08:59,184 --> 00:09:00,718
Fine.

224
00:09:00,719 --> 00:09:03,254
Dr. Perry might know.

225
00:09:03,255 --> 00:09:06,189
Render environment bio lab.

226
00:09:07,892 --> 00:09:10,727
Look, there's Britta and Troy
fooling around with each other.

227
00:09:10,728 --> 00:09:13,830
Look, there's Abed having
overcome his issues.

228
00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:15,198
Nice try.

229
00:09:15,199 --> 00:09:18,501
Dr. Barnes, Dr. Perry.

230
00:09:18,502 --> 00:09:21,571
We just saved an uninsured
homeless man's life.

231
00:09:21,572 --> 00:09:23,940
Using an unapproved procedure.

232
00:09:23,941 --> 00:09:26,876
Now, we're going to kiss.

233
00:09:32,649 --> 00:09:34,216
This is what you think I want?

234
00:09:34,217 --> 00:09:36,751
What do you want,
administrator?

235
00:09:36,752 --> 00:09:38,319
I want to talk to Abed.

236
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,754
There's no one here
by that name.

237
00:09:39,755 --> 00:09:41,957
- You're lying.
- Maybe I am, so what?

238
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:43,992
I was raised on
the mean streets of Harlem.

239
00:09:43,993 --> 00:09:45,193
I'm not scared of you.

240
00:09:45,194 --> 00:09:48,129
Well, be scared of this.

241
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,534
Sodium pentothal, known commonly
as truth serum.

242
00:09:56,170 --> 00:10:00,040
I saw Abed's name
in the hospital school files,

243
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:02,275
I love butt stuff,
I hate spiders,

244
00:10:02,276 --> 00:10:04,344
I stole a pen from the bank,

245
00:10:04,345 --> 00:10:07,047
<i>I cried during About a Boy...
The soundtrack...</i>

246
00:10:07,048 --> 00:10:09,616
I don't wash my hands
before surgery.

247
00:10:09,617 --> 00:10:12,118
I can see why women find
Clive Owen attractive to the point

248
00:10:12,119 --> 00:10:14,220
where I might just as well be
attracted to him.

249
00:10:14,221 --> 00:10:17,023
I use comparisons to Hitler to
win arguments on the Internet

250
00:10:17,024 --> 00:10:18,324
at the drop of a hat.

251
00:10:18,325 --> 00:10:20,093
I know nothing about wine.

252
00:10:20,094 --> 00:10:22,561
I'm more turned on by women
in pajamas than lingerie.

253
00:10:22,562 --> 00:10:24,430
I just want to know
they feel comfortable.

254
00:10:24,431 --> 00:10:28,166
<i>I didn't get Inception.</i>

255
00:10:28,167 --> 00:10:31,870
<i>I didn't get Inception.</i>

256
00:10:33,973 --> 00:10:35,540
You said you saw
his name in the files.

257
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:37,375
There's so many layers.

258
00:10:37,376 --> 00:10:41,311
Right, render environment
medical study room.

259
00:10:41,312 --> 00:10:42,613
There's head nurse, Shirley,

260
00:10:42,614 --> 00:10:44,649
talking to tragic,
heart-wrenching Alzheimer's

261
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:47,084
patient and Emmy-contender,
Pierce Hawthorne.

262
00:10:47,085 --> 00:10:51,088
Mr. Hawthorne,
you're out of your bed again.

263
00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:52,556
'Cause I think I'm on a train.

264
00:10:52,557 --> 00:10:54,291
Oh! Oh!

265
00:10:54,292 --> 00:10:56,527
Shirley, get me
the file on Abed.

266
00:10:56,528 --> 00:10:58,227
Abed doesn't exist, young lady.

267
00:10:58,228 --> 00:10:59,663
He exists if I say so.

268
00:10:59,664 --> 00:11:00,997
This is my hospital school.

269
00:11:00,998 --> 00:11:02,999
Your hospital school,
young lady, is a simulation

270
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,001
being run through a filter of
other people's needs.

271
00:11:05,002 --> 00:11:08,838
Abed's been filtered out
because nobody needs him.

272
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:09,839
I need him.

273
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,974
Well you're not simulated.

274
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,275
No, but this is!

275
00:11:13,342 --> 00:11:14,743
Ooh!

276
00:11:14,744 --> 00:11:16,145
And there's more where that
didn't come from.

277
00:11:16,146 --> 00:11:17,946
This is a private compartment.

278
00:11:17,947 --> 00:11:20,115
- Jeff, get the files.
- Why me?

279
00:11:20,116 --> 00:11:22,951
Because you can see
the cabinets.

280
00:11:22,952 --> 00:11:24,153
And I'll make love to you.

281
00:11:24,154 --> 00:11:26,188
Jackpot.

282
00:11:29,224 --> 00:11:31,625
There is an Abed in this
hospital school,

283
00:11:31,626 --> 00:11:34,862
but he's not a doctor.

284
00:11:34,863 --> 00:11:36,430
He's a patient.

285
00:11:36,431 --> 00:11:38,532
- Notify security!
- Conductor!

286
00:11:38,533 --> 00:11:39,867
Jeff, take me to Abed.

287
00:11:39,868 --> 00:11:41,102
Where is that?

288
00:11:41,103 --> 00:11:43,871
Enough games, just take me
where I wanna go.

289
00:11:43,872 --> 00:11:45,461
Follow me.

290
00:11:46,834 --> 00:11:47,708
Are we close?

291
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:50,110
Almost there, although you
should probably run in place

292
00:11:50,111 --> 00:11:53,046
and let the hall
move around you.

293
00:11:58,285 --> 00:12:00,653
- Here we are.
- Where?

294
00:12:00,654 --> 00:12:02,454
Where you wanted to go.

295
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:05,591
The last night of school,
first year.

296
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:07,426
The night we kissed.

297
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:10,896
Ababed wasn't there,
so whose memory is this?

298
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,198
Maybe it's yours.

299
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:14,600
Maybe the Dreamatorium
really works.

300
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:16,735
Or maybe Leonard was watching
from the bushes

301
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,469
and told Abed about it.

302
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,939
I don't have cable.

303
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,673
Knock it off, Abed.

304
00:12:22,674 --> 00:12:23,742
I'm not Abed.

305
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,377
You're confused, so was I.

306
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:27,879
But not anymore.

307
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,514
Jeff...
Abed, stop!

308
00:12:30,515 --> 00:12:31,716
I don't wanna do this.

309
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:34,885
I want to talk to Abed.

310
00:12:34,886 --> 00:12:38,922
I'm taking the file.

311
00:12:38,923 --> 00:12:42,559
Oh, it says Abed
is in the recovery parlor.

312
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,229
Condition... never better.

313
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:48,465
You're not holding anything.

314
00:12:48,466 --> 00:12:51,433
This is the file.

315
00:12:51,434 --> 00:12:54,971
Abed Nadir,
psychiatric patient 1373,

316
00:12:54,972 --> 00:12:57,073
control freak with no empathy.

317
00:12:57,074 --> 00:13:00,709
People bend over backwards
to cater to him.

318
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:05,180
Signed, healthcare administrator
Annie Edison.

319
00:13:05,181 --> 00:13:07,415
That's out of context.

320
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:08,583
Shh.

321
00:13:08,584 --> 00:13:10,585
You've thought
of everything, Annie.

322
00:13:10,586 --> 00:13:13,221
With Abed gone
and Troy and Britta together,

323
00:13:13,222 --> 00:13:15,123
there's nothing standing
in the way of us.

324
00:13:15,124 --> 00:13:16,324
Wait, what?

325
00:13:16,325 --> 00:13:17,592
Come on.

326
00:13:17,593 --> 00:13:18,660
This is you dream.

327
00:13:18,661 --> 00:13:21,595
This is why you
played matchmaker.

328
00:13:21,596 --> 00:13:24,231
This is what's important to you.

329
00:13:24,232 --> 00:13:26,700
You are not Jeff.

330
00:13:26,701 --> 00:13:29,703
Because Jeff cares about Abed.

331
00:13:29,704 --> 00:13:31,338
And I did not push
Troy and Britta together

332
00:13:31,339 --> 00:13:32,606
so this would happen.

333
00:13:32,607 --> 00:13:34,275
I did it because I thought
they were cute together

334
00:13:34,276 --> 00:13:36,277
and this would
have been a bonus.

335
00:13:36,278 --> 00:13:38,178
And we are not here.

336
00:13:38,179 --> 00:13:41,580
And I'm not staying here because
I hate whoever you are.

337
00:13:41,581 --> 00:13:43,582
You should probably
storm off in...

338
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:44,984
Oh!

339
00:13:45,653 --> 00:13:47,588
In place.

340
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:57,435
Where do you wanna go next?

341
00:13:57,867 --> 00:13:59,682
I wanna be alone.

342
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:01,572
Sounds good to me.

343
00:14:01,573 --> 00:14:04,508
Execute simulation,
Annie/Annie.

344
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:08,442
There.

345
00:14:08,555 --> 00:14:09,922
Now we're alone.

346
00:14:10,553 --> 00:14:12,527
Great, so you're me now.

347
00:14:12,673 --> 00:14:14,917
Why are you blowing
our magic moment with Jeff?

348
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,070
It's not magic.

349
00:14:16,084 --> 00:14:17,217
It's not even real.

350
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,845
But we love Jeff.

351
00:14:19,846 --> 00:14:22,581
No, we don't.

352
00:14:22,582 --> 00:14:25,750
We're just in love
with the idea of being loved.

353
00:14:25,751 --> 00:14:27,565
And if we can teach a guy
like Jeff to do it,

354
00:14:27,595 --> 00:14:28,889
we'll never be unloved.

355
00:14:28,928 --> 00:14:32,358
So we keep running the same
scenario over and over

356
00:14:32,424 --> 00:14:33,702
hoping for a different result.

357
00:14:33,745 --> 00:14:35,445
Running scenarios.

358
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,788
Careful now.

359
00:14:36,896 --> 00:14:39,646
You're starting
to sound like Abed.

360
00:14:40,077 --> 00:14:43,846
<i>So... I probably shouldn't say
things like "Star Wars.</i>

361
00:14:43,935 --> 00:14:46,436
<i>Zardoz, Cougar Town,
cool, cool, cool."</i>

362
00:14:46,437 --> 00:14:48,072
- Stop it.
- Pop culture, pop culture.

363
00:14:48,073 --> 00:14:51,075
- I'm on a TV show.
- You're gonna get in trouble.

364
00:14:51,076 --> 00:14:52,843
Meta, meta.

365
00:14:52,844 --> 00:14:54,044
It's Abed!

366
00:14:54,045 --> 00:14:55,612
I got an Abed here!

367
00:14:55,613 --> 00:14:56,846
Get him!

368
00:14:56,847 --> 00:14:57,847
That's it.

369
00:14:57,848 --> 00:14:59,448
I find you guilty of being Abed.

370
00:14:59,449 --> 00:15:00,883
You're under arrest!

371
00:15:00,884 --> 00:15:02,151
Can I just interject and say

372
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:05,088
I don't know what
the hell's going on?

373
00:15:11,161 --> 00:15:13,929
This time you'll never get out.

374
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,864
Abed?

375
00:15:18,601 --> 00:15:19,601
Abed.

376
00:15:19,602 --> 00:15:20,836
Yeah.

377
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:22,470
I found you by turning into you,
how cool is that?

378
00:15:22,471 --> 00:15:24,072
Cool.
Cool, cool, cool.

379
00:15:24,073 --> 00:15:25,673
Tell me where we are
so I can pretend to see it.

380
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:27,342
We're inside a locker.

381
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:30,277
It's where I spent a lot of time
in junior high.

382
00:15:30,278 --> 00:15:31,812
You think this is
where we'd put you?

383
00:15:31,813 --> 00:15:34,581
- You know that's absurd, right?
- Well, I'm not stupid.

384
00:15:34,582 --> 00:15:36,751
You can see I've increased
the square footage.

385
00:15:36,752 --> 00:15:38,418
It's a metaphorical locker.

386
00:15:38,419 --> 00:15:39,686
It's a place where
people like me get put

387
00:15:39,687 --> 00:15:41,021
when everyone's finally
fed up with us.

388
00:15:41,022 --> 00:15:44,157
Abed, so maudlin.

389
00:15:44,158 --> 00:15:45,927
If you start turning
into a vampire...

390
00:15:45,953 --> 00:15:47,119
I've run the simulations,
Annie.

391
00:15:47,158 --> 00:15:48,242
I don't get married,
I don't invent

392
00:15:48,254 --> 00:15:50,003
a billion dollar website
that helps people have sex.

393
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:52,273
I don't make in into Sundance,
Slamdance or Dance Pants.

394
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,333
Troy invents Dance Pants
in 2019.

395
00:15:54,334 --> 00:15:55,835
Don't tell him, he needs to
stumble onto it.

396
00:15:55,836 --> 00:15:57,036
All right, listen.

397
00:15:57,037 --> 00:15:58,604
The scenarios you run in here

398
00:15:58,605 --> 00:16:02,007
are like...
great science fiction.

399
00:16:02,008 --> 00:16:05,644
They're impressive and detailed
and insightful,

400
00:16:05,645 --> 00:16:07,813
but they're not
accurate for crap.

401
00:16:07,814 --> 00:16:09,614
Science fiction never has been.

402
00:16:09,615 --> 00:16:11,116
<i>Look at 2001.</i>

403
00:16:11,117 --> 00:16:12,918
Did we have a space odyssey?

404
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:15,254
No, we got snowboarding
in the Olympics

405
00:16:15,255 --> 00:16:16,888
and we over-validated
Carson Daily.

406
00:16:16,889 --> 00:16:19,257
- That poor guy.
- Yeah, cry me a river.

407
00:16:19,258 --> 00:16:20,825
My point is, your simulations

408
00:16:20,826 --> 00:16:22,726
are nothing more
than anxieties.

409
00:16:22,727 --> 00:16:24,195
You're afraid you don't fit in.

410
00:16:24,196 --> 00:16:25,797
You're afraid you'll be alone.

411
00:16:25,798 --> 00:16:28,666
Great news... you share
that with all of us,

412
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:32,202
so you'll never be alone
and you'll always fit in.

413
00:16:32,203 --> 00:16:35,272
And, yes, that's why I meddled
with Troy and Britta.

414
00:16:35,273 --> 00:16:36,273
You caught me.

415
00:16:36,274 --> 00:16:37,707
I was trying to make life go

416
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:39,075
according to some script.

417
00:16:39,076 --> 00:16:40,610
I can't.

418
00:16:40,611 --> 00:16:42,612
You can't.

419
00:16:42,613 --> 00:16:45,882
We both need to get more
comfortable winging it.

420
00:16:45,883 --> 00:16:47,350
At least it'll be less work.

421
00:16:47,351 --> 00:16:48,784
It would cut down my
Dreamatorium time

422
00:16:48,785 --> 00:16:50,186
by 18 hours a week.

423
00:16:50,187 --> 00:16:51,187
I could take up yoga.

424
00:16:51,188 --> 00:16:53,088
You've got the body type.

425
00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:54,924
Now let's get you out of here.

426
00:16:54,925 --> 00:16:56,158
I don't know how.

427
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:57,893
These fake shackles
don't have a fake key.

428
00:16:57,894 --> 00:17:00,896
Isn't that what a...
quantum spanner's for?

429
00:17:00,897 --> 00:17:03,432
Technically, no.

430
00:17:03,433 --> 00:17:06,534
But that's fine.

431
00:17:11,173 --> 00:17:13,274
So should we get back to lunch?

432
00:17:13,275 --> 00:17:14,275
I guess so.

433
00:17:14,276 --> 00:17:15,276
A little more anticlimactic

434
00:17:15,277 --> 00:17:16,277
than I would have simulated it,

435
00:17:16,278 --> 00:17:19,080
- but whatever.
- Anticlimactic?

436
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:21,048
Render environment
observo-deck,

437
00:17:21,049 --> 00:17:25,552
<i>H.M.S. Spacetime 12.</i>

438
00:17:25,553 --> 00:17:28,788
Inspector, set the tachyon drive
to hyperjump.

439
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:30,790
We must get to the other side of
this star field

440
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:33,526
before the Blorgons intercept.

441
00:17:33,527 --> 00:17:35,795
Blorgons in this sector?

442
00:17:35,796 --> 00:17:38,397
Well, this mission has gone
pear-shaped, indeed.

443
00:17:38,398 --> 00:17:40,566
Prepare to hyperjump
on my mark.

444
00:17:40,567 --> 00:17:42,935
Bugger the dovecoats,
inspector.

445
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,737
We're too late! Blorgons!

446
00:17:44,738 --> 00:17:47,306
Eradicate! Eradicate!

447
00:17:47,307 --> 00:17:50,910
Our quantum blasters are
useless against their armor.

448
00:17:50,911 --> 00:17:53,278
We're as cooked as Lord Nelson's
mutton, we are.

449
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:54,812
Not if I can help it.

450
00:17:54,813 --> 00:17:59,284
I'll see you on the other side
inspector... Wherever that is.

451
00:17:59,285 --> 00:18:02,653
Don't you mean
"whenever that is"?

452
00:18:05,992 --> 00:18:08,058
Take that, Blorgon scum!

453
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:11,195
You'll blo-gon me
for this later.

454
00:18:11,196 --> 00:18:12,796
Ow, Annie!

455
00:18:12,797 --> 00:18:14,198
Oh, oh, my God!

456
00:18:14,199 --> 00:18:16,300
Abed, I'm so sorry.

457
00:18:16,301 --> 00:18:17,701
No, no, you're committing.

458
00:18:17,702 --> 00:18:18,869
This is good stuff.

459
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:21,471
Thanks.

460
00:18:21,472 --> 00:18:23,607
I am Abed Nadir...

461
00:18:23,608 --> 00:18:25,775
And I don't know a lot of things
everyone else knows.

462
00:18:25,776 --> 00:18:27,810
I wander the universe
with my friend, Troy,

463
00:18:27,811 --> 00:18:29,312
doing whatever I want.

464
00:18:29,313 --> 00:18:32,715
Sometimes accidentally hurting
innocent unremarkables.

465
00:18:32,716 --> 00:18:36,152
This week, however, Troy went
to lunch and I adapted.

466
00:18:36,153 --> 00:18:39,222
I now have the ability
to enter the minds of others.

467
00:18:39,223 --> 00:18:41,423
- I'm hungry, are you hungry?
- Yeah.

468
00:18:41,424 --> 00:18:42,991
I'll make us buttered noodles.

469
00:18:42,992 --> 00:18:46,428
Using an elusive new
technique known as "empathy".

470
00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:50,152
So was the other fast food
place worth the drive, Shirley?

471
00:18:50,233 --> 00:18:52,302
You know, half way there I
thought, "What am I doing?

472
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:54,462
It's the same fast food place
in a different location.

473
00:18:54,503 --> 00:18:56,849
Have the margins of my life
become so narrow?"

474
00:18:56,915 --> 00:18:58,615
So I went to the mall
and had pizza.

475
00:18:59,651 --> 00:19:02,520
Sounds like this has been a
game-changing day for all of us.

476
00:19:03,177 --> 00:19:04,945
I almost sat on my balls,

477
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:08,410
but at the last second,
I made an adjustment.

478
00:19:08,462 --> 00:19:10,363
- Good job!
- Good work.

479
00:19:10,433 --> 00:19:11,321
Good job, man.

480
00:19:11,355 --> 00:19:13,052
Well, we had a good lunch, too.

481
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,521
Yeah.

482
00:19:15,522 --> 00:19:17,090
<i>I spoke to the manager
about Die Hard,</i>

483
00:19:17,091 --> 00:19:18,658
and I told him he should be
ashamed of himself.

484
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:20,026
Thanks.

485
00:19:20,027 --> 00:19:22,162
Sorry I bailed
on the Dreamatorium.

486
00:19:22,163 --> 00:19:26,166
It's okay, Annie did pretty
good in a pinch.

487
00:19:26,167 --> 00:19:29,634
All right, back to cramming?

488
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:32,871
The people at the bank loved
my outfit.

489
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:35,240
And they had all kinds of
questions about it

490
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:36,741
and my answers seemed to amuse

491
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:39,378
and... and even liberate
them a little.

492
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:40,946
A few of us went to lunch

493
00:19:40,947 --> 00:19:44,915
and I had the deepest
conversation of my life.

494
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:48,886
I gotta go,
I'm telling everybody.

495
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:51,489
Hmm, maybe after
a long, dark night,

496
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,091
the sun is starting
to rise on Greendale.

497
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:56,094
Maybe. Maybe not.

498
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:58,762
You never can tell what kind
of day you're gonna have.

499
00:19:58,763 --> 00:20:00,697
Okay, I didn't really avoid
sitting on them.

500
00:20:00,698 --> 00:20:02,532
I sat right on them.

501
00:20:02,533 --> 00:20:04,101
- Oh.
- Aw.

502
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:05,402
- I'm sorry.
- Pierce, I'm sorry.

503
00:20:05,403 --> 00:20:06,703
Hurt like hell.

504
00:20:06,704 --> 00:20:08,638
I saw eagles.

505
00:20:11,486 --> 00:20:13,581
♪ Troy and Abed
in the morning ♪

506
00:20:13,582 --> 00:20:14,983
Today we're joined
by Annie Edison...

507
00:20:14,984 --> 00:20:16,250
- Hi!
- Who's gonna show us how

508
00:20:16,251 --> 00:20:17,685
to spruce up your
apartment on a budget.

509
00:20:17,686 --> 00:20:19,087
So, Annie, what
inspired this throw?

510
00:20:19,088 --> 00:20:21,522
Well, I just thought
that I'd cover up the stain

511
00:20:21,523 --> 00:20:23,690
where Abed spilled code red
on the couch last week.

512
00:20:23,691 --> 00:20:25,025
Oops. Crafty.

513
00:20:25,026 --> 00:20:26,627
And you have some tips
on entertaining.

514
00:20:26,628 --> 00:20:28,461
Yes, if you're
expecting company,

515
00:20:28,462 --> 00:20:30,764
but you don't have enough
chairs, you can bring out

516
00:20:30,765 --> 00:20:33,366
pillows from your bedroom and
use them on the floor

517
00:20:33,367 --> 00:20:34,801
for a Moroccan feel.

518
00:20:34,802 --> 00:20:36,903
- Ooh, a taste of the Orient.
- Ooh!

519
00:20:36,904 --> 00:20:39,571
Actually, boys, I have
a little surprise for you.

520
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:40,606
- Uh-oh.
- While you two were out

521
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:41,774
playing blazer tag...

522
00:20:41,775 --> 00:20:43,542
That's laser tag
with sport coats.

523
00:20:43,543 --> 00:20:47,146
I did a little extreme
bedroom makeover!

524
00:20:47,147 --> 00:20:50,482
I unbunked your beds and got
scrap fabric and...

525
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:53,385
It's okay, buddy.

526
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:54,385
We can put it back.

527
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:55,586
We can put it back
the way it was.

528
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:56,855
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

529
00:20:56,856 --> 00:20:59,457
It's... cut, Garrett.

530
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,759
Sorry!

530
00:21:01,305 --> 00:21:07,266
