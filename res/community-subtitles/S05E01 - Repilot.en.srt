1
00:00:01,137 --> 00:00:02,478
I am the system.

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:04,275
I consume humanity.

3
00:00:04,432 --> 00:00:07,397
- There is no escape.
- Objection!

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,194
Jeff Winger, hero-at-law

5
00:00:10,354 --> 00:00:11,991
Best lawyer you ever saw

6
00:00:12,607 --> 00:00:13,781
Hero to freedom

7
00:00:13,941 --> 00:00:15,365
Defender of liberty

8
00:00:15,526 --> 00:00:17,329
South of the 40 at Lincoln

9
00:00:17,487 --> 00:00:18,910
You park for free
Jeff

10
00:00:19,071 --> 00:00:22,286
Are you a good person being sued,
oppressed or beaten?

11
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:26,163
I can help,
and that's the Winger Guarantee.

12
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:29,046
Call 555-her...

13
00:00:29,207 --> 00:00:31,792
Maybe you should've spent
less money on special effects.

14
00:00:31,959 --> 00:00:35,803
Yeah. Thanks a lot,
Francis Ford Repo Man.

15
00:00:42,345 --> 00:00:45,144
Jeff Winger, loser-at-law

16
00:00:45,306 --> 00:00:49,103
Rented office in a mini mall

17
00:00:49,769 --> 00:00:52,189
Relax, Tango. I come in peace.

18
00:00:52,355 --> 00:00:53,861
Way I see it, I screwed you...

19
00:00:54,023 --> 00:00:56,787
...I got screwed back.
Now we can bygone the bygones.

20
00:00:56,943 --> 00:00:59,529
I got a juicy new client
and a bone to throw you.

21
00:00:59,695 --> 00:01:01,535
Hear about that bridge
that collapsed?

22
00:01:01,697 --> 00:01:03,584
A human could say that
without salivating.

23
00:01:03,741 --> 00:01:06,458
I represent Marvin Humphries,
the engineer who designed it.

24
00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:08,126
He wants to seek damages.

25
00:01:08,287 --> 00:01:09,711
From what? His own pencil?

26
00:01:09,872 --> 00:01:13,550
From the only school reckless enough
to give him a degree in engineering.

27
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:17,138
City-funded school,
deep government pockets.

28
00:01:17,421 --> 00:01:18,928
Maybe you've heard of it.

29
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:21,510
Greendale Community College.

30
00:01:21,676 --> 00:01:24,310
Weird choice, by the way,
bachelor's degree on the wall.

31
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:27,056
You're gonna sue my school,
you're bothering to tell me?

32
00:01:27,223 --> 00:01:28,350
You have access there.

33
00:01:28,516 --> 00:01:32,396
I need Marvin's records to prove
that he was irresponsibly educated.

34
00:01:32,562 --> 00:01:34,567
- Well, why don't you just subpoena?
- Right.

35
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,985
So they can have a shredding party.

36
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,653
That's the difference
between you and Greendale, Alan.

37
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:41,160
They wouldn't shred evidence.

38
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,993
It's a good place for good people.

39
00:01:43,156 --> 00:01:44,283
It's a diploma mill.

40
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:46,785
It turns idiots
into bridge collapsers...

41
00:01:46,951 --> 00:01:50,747
...and Jeff Winger into an attorney
that thought he could...

42
00:01:50,913 --> 00:01:53,250
...help people?

43
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:56,263
Jeff, I once saw you
convince an arson victim...

44
00:01:56,419 --> 00:01:58,424
...that he liked his house better burnt.

45
00:02:00,089 --> 00:02:02,640
God, look what that school
did to you.

46
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,386
It took all your money,
it took four years of your life.

47
00:02:05,553 --> 00:02:08,056
And worst of all,
it took your Winger moves.

48
00:02:08,222 --> 00:02:09,776
I still got my Winger moves.

49
00:02:09,932 --> 00:02:11,937
Prove it. Get me Humphries' records.

50
00:02:12,101 --> 00:02:15,447
Because the next bone you get thrown
might be through a dude's zipper...

51
00:02:15,605 --> 00:02:19,116
...in the warehouse district and I can't
guarantee you it'll be from me.

52
00:02:19,275 --> 00:02:21,446
I might be broke, desperate,
nearly homeless...

53
00:02:21,611 --> 00:02:25,668
...but I still got one thing deep down
inside that gives me power... That was it.

54
00:02:25,823 --> 00:02:26,950
That was all I had.

55
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,074

00:02:52,308 --> 00:02:54,230
Welcome back, human beings.

57
00:02:54,393 --> 00:02:57,490
Dean Pelton here, wishing you
another magic year at Greendale...

58
00:02:57,647 --> 00:03:00,411
...ranked America's number two
community college...

59
00:03:00,566 --> 00:03:02,821
...by
greendalecommunitycollege.com.

60
00:03:02,985 --> 00:03:07,208
Regarding the recent tragedy
surrounding a certain collapsed bridge...

61
00:03:07,365 --> 00:03:09,951
...we'll be observing a moment
of silence on the quad...

62
00:03:10,117 --> 00:03:13,581
...followed by four years of silence
to the press.

63
00:03:13,746 --> 00:03:14,957
I told you you'd be back.

64
00:03:15,122 --> 00:03:16,594
Shut up, Leonard. I'm not here.

65
00:03:16,749 --> 00:03:19,549
I'm just a figment
of your creeping dementia.

66
00:03:26,425 --> 00:03:27,932
Hi.

67
00:03:28,219 --> 00:03:31,268
How would I go about
getting records for certain alumni?

68
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:34,527
Why would you think a stranger
could just walk in here and do that?

69
00:03:34,684 --> 00:03:36,274
You're Rita.

70
00:03:36,435 --> 00:03:38,690
- Rhonda.
- I've always regretted not telling you...

71
00:03:38,855 --> 00:03:42,236
...how much you remind me
of my aunt.

72
00:03:44,402 --> 00:03:46,870
It's more disarming than it sounds.

73
00:03:47,029 --> 00:03:50,126
I have a very attractive aunt.

74
00:03:50,283 --> 00:03:52,335
Rhonda, why are you wearing
Jeff Winger's...?

75
00:03:53,161 --> 00:03:54,371
Jeffrey.

76
00:03:54,537 --> 00:03:57,385
Are you looking for your friends?
They don't go here anymore.

77
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,043
Looking for something
in front of you the whole time?

78
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:01,550
He's asking for records...

79
00:04:02,628 --> 00:04:03,802
...for a certain alumni.

80
00:04:05,381 --> 00:04:08,229
In the midst of all this
Marvin Humphries business...

81
00:04:08,384 --> 00:04:12,893
...I doubt this is a coincidence.
You're here to save me, aren't you?

82
00:04:13,473 --> 00:04:14,813
Yes.

83
00:04:14,974 --> 00:04:16,730
I thought I might contact alumni...

84
00:04:16,893 --> 00:04:18,234
...to form a committee.

85
00:04:18,394 --> 00:04:20,731
The Save Greendale Committee.
Working title.

86
00:04:20,897 --> 00:04:22,617
Jeffrey, I'm gonna cry.

87
00:04:22,773 --> 00:04:25,491
- Please don't.
- Request denied.

88
00:04:26,736 --> 00:04:29,072
Rhonda will let you
in the records room.

89
00:04:29,238 --> 00:04:31,041
It's actually your old study room.

90
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,209
After you and your friends left,
it was closed for sentimental reasons.

91
00:04:35,369 --> 00:04:38,584
And asbestos reasons,
but it's clean as a whistle now.

92
00:04:43,002 --> 00:04:45,766
"Harassment reports,
hazardous waste citations...

93
00:04:45,922 --> 00:04:47,927
...herpes, water fountains."

94
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:49,977
Come on. Where's Humphries?

95
00:04:50,134 --> 00:04:52,222
- I see your value now.
- Abed, why?

96
00:04:52,386 --> 00:04:54,641
It's a callback to when
we met first season.

97
00:04:54,806 --> 00:04:57,605
Me calling years "seasons"
is a callback to my dialogue and...

98
00:04:57,767 --> 00:04:59,439
I know what makes you off-putting...

99
00:04:59,602 --> 00:05:02,781
- ...but why are you here?
- Dean called me about the committee.

100
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:05,026
- Can I join?
- Oh, no. Who else did he call?

101
00:05:05,191 --> 00:05:07,445
Just me. I called everyone else.

102
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,367
Jeffrey.

103
00:05:11,781 --> 00:05:13,334
Jeff.

104
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:16,453
- Is that cool?
- It's the coolest.

105
00:05:16,619 --> 00:05:20,380
Jeff, if you wanted to save Greendale,
why didn't you call us first?

106
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,675
Well, you guys just got sprung
from this joint.

107
00:05:22,834 --> 00:05:24,969
And I figured you had careers
to get started.

108
00:05:25,127 --> 00:05:26,718
- Yeah, working hard.
- Yes.

109
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:28,931
- Yeah. So many things.
- Yeah. Sandwiches...

110
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,478
Us, always doing stuff.

111
00:05:30,633 --> 00:05:33,397
What have they done to our home?
The table's buried.

112
00:05:36,764 --> 00:05:39,184
- I got it.
- This is where we became a family.

113
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,940
Where Jeff made us a family.

114
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:44,234
We can repilot.

115
00:05:44,397 --> 00:05:47,327
This could be like Scrubs season nine,
a revamp, a do-over.

116
00:05:47,483 --> 00:05:50,746
- Jeff could come back as a teacher.
- I'm not gonna be a teacher, Abed.

117
00:05:51,154 --> 00:05:52,245
Come on.

118
00:05:52,405 --> 00:05:53,911
Sit in your chair.

119
00:05:54,073 --> 00:05:55,995
Complete the table.

120
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:58,792
- We wanna help you save Greendale.
- Yeah.

121
00:05:58,953 --> 00:06:01,373
- Greendale. Greendale. Greendale.
- Save it.

122
00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:02,832
I gotta go to the bathroom.

123
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:05,669
Give him space.

124
00:06:05,835 --> 00:06:07,009
Repiloting can be intense.

125
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,887
New people show up,
regulars shift roles or even fall away.

126
00:06:10,047 --> 00:06:12,384
In Scrubs, Zach was only
in the first six episodes.

127
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,677
That son of a bitch.

128
00:06:13,843 --> 00:06:16,691
After everything Scrubs did for him?

129
00:06:17,013 --> 00:06:18,056
I'm sorry.

130
00:06:19,348 --> 00:06:21,484
Vision boarding.

131
00:06:21,642 --> 00:06:22,816
Okay, vision boarding...

132
00:06:22,977 --> 00:06:24,104
Oh, hi, Jeffrey.

133
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:27,533
I have to warn you about something
because it's the right thing to do.

134
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:31,487
First, why is there a big empty box on
your desk that says "Humphries" on it?

135
00:06:35,364 --> 00:06:37,334
The press has been calling
about Humphries.

136
00:06:37,492 --> 00:06:39,960
I didn't want any details
about his enrolment here...

137
00:06:40,119 --> 00:06:41,626
...to be spun against us...

138
00:06:41,787 --> 00:06:43,294
...so now there are no details.

139
00:06:44,165 --> 00:06:45,209
That was his thesis.

140
00:06:48,377 --> 00:06:50,217
Okay. So sue me.

141
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:51,851
This ain't Harvard, Jeffrey.

142
00:06:52,006 --> 00:06:56,147
Okay, my job is to give
a certain number of degrees per year...

143
00:06:56,302 --> 00:06:57,975
...or we could get shut down.

144
00:06:58,137 --> 00:06:59,810
And that would be bad because...?

145
00:07:00,223 --> 00:07:02,062
Because then I wouldn't have a job.

146
00:07:02,642 --> 00:07:05,276
And, you know, Greendale
is a good place for good people.

147
00:07:05,436 --> 00:07:06,647
That whole spiel, huh?

148
00:07:06,938 --> 00:07:08,148
Yeah.

149
00:07:08,314 --> 00:07:10,236
That whole spiel.

150
00:07:13,736 --> 00:07:14,780
Wing Blade.

151
00:07:14,946 --> 00:07:16,832
Shock me by impressing me.

152
00:07:16,989 --> 00:07:19,244
- He shredded Humphries.
- What?

153
00:07:19,575 --> 00:07:21,746
I told you.
How could you let this happen?

154
00:07:21,911 --> 00:07:24,675
Sir, I have to ask you
to leave the concierge desk.

155
00:07:26,082 --> 00:07:29,676
Jeff, this case was all I had.
I am screwed.

156
00:07:29,836 --> 00:07:31,971
My wife left,
my girlfriend dumped me.

157
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:34,217
And they're sisters,
whole family's pissed.

158
00:07:34,382 --> 00:07:36,885
Shut up. Bring me paperwork
for filing a class action.

159
00:07:37,051 --> 00:07:40,183
Letters of intent, engagement,
everything. Multiple copies.

160
00:07:40,346 --> 00:07:42,731
Winger, you just lost our client!

161
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:45,773
Yeah. But I can create five new ones.

162
00:07:45,935 --> 00:07:47,276
So dusty. Let's get this off.

163
00:07:47,436 --> 00:07:50,783
- Season nine of Scrubs.
- And that's the Winger Guarantee.

164
00:07:54,694 --> 00:07:57,826
Okay. Maybe we should brainstorm
fundraising ideas...

165
00:07:57,989 --> 00:07:59,958
...that aren't bake sales.

166
00:08:00,116 --> 00:08:04,078
Or opening a zoo where the humans are
in cages and the animals come to visit.

167
00:08:04,245 --> 00:08:07,294
Are you okay, Jeff?
You left kind of freaked out.

168
00:08:07,665 --> 00:08:12,007
Well, I can't stop thinking this school
might be in trouble...

169
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:15,302
- ...because of this bridge guy.
- He's the one making bad bridges.

170
00:08:15,464 --> 00:08:18,811
That's like me blaming owls
for how much I suck at analogies.

171
00:08:18,968 --> 00:08:22,147
Sometimes a student will claim,
in court...

172
00:08:22,305 --> 00:08:24,891
...that their school ruined their life...

173
00:08:25,308 --> 00:08:26,565
...and they'll win.

174
00:08:26,726 --> 00:08:29,490
You wanna save Greendale?
Make it litigation-proof.

175
00:08:29,645 --> 00:08:32,493
- How?
- Think like the enemy.

176
00:08:32,732 --> 00:08:34,404
How did Greendale damage you,
Annie?

177
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:36,987
It didn't.
I love hospital administration.

178
00:08:37,153 --> 00:08:40,166
- Is that your job?
- Well, not yet.

179
00:08:40,323 --> 00:08:46,338
But I administer
things to hospitals, like these. Pen?

180
00:08:47,788 --> 00:08:50,506
- "Futurza"?
- They're a rising star in pharmaceuticals.

181
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:54,130
They invented fibromyalgia
and the cure for fibromyalgia.

182
00:08:54,295 --> 00:08:56,098
You push drugs now? That's ironic.

183
00:08:56,255 --> 00:08:57,679
I push pens, Britta.

184
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,640
Speaking of irony,
how's the therapy market? Depressed?

185
00:09:00,802 --> 00:09:02,688
- I'm on sabbatical.
- You're Jewish?

186
00:09:02,845 --> 00:09:06,274
I'm doing hands-on research
about the psychology of alcoholism.

187
00:09:06,432 --> 00:09:07,939
You're a bartender, aren't you?

188
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,236
Which is basically
like a modern-day therapist.

189
00:09:10,394 --> 00:09:12,863
Somebody tells me about a murder,
I can't tell anyone.

190
00:09:13,022 --> 00:09:14,612
You're even bad at bartending.

191
00:09:14,774 --> 00:09:15,948
What about you?

192
00:09:16,108 --> 00:09:18,826
Abed's working on the next
billion-dollar social media app.

193
00:09:18,986 --> 00:09:21,704
And when it takes off,
all I gotta do is sue him.

194
00:09:21,864 --> 00:09:24,545
- It's foolproof.
- You're programming now, Abed?

195
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,121
Didn't get any work
with your four-year film degree?

196
00:09:27,286 --> 00:09:29,541
Directing a commercial.
Still haven't been paid.

197
00:09:29,705 --> 00:09:33,134
I'll cut you a cheque tomorrow,
but just so we're clear, you quit.

198
00:09:33,292 --> 00:09:35,712
- Differences.
- I asked you to put the phone number...

199
00:09:35,878 --> 00:09:38,215
- ...on the screen.
- I didn't like the number. 555?

200
00:09:38,381 --> 00:09:40,220
- The number of my business.
- Sounds fake.

201
00:09:40,383 --> 00:09:43,182
Every number starts with 555.
Are there only 10,000 numbers?

202
00:09:43,344 --> 00:09:44,555
Abed, you quit?

203
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,983
Said you got fired. You haven't paid
rent in our apartment in months.

204
00:09:48,141 --> 00:09:50,821
Sell him a pill that will help him
give up on his dreams.

205
00:09:50,977 --> 00:09:54,441
Relaxabrex doesn't make you give up
on your dreams. That's a side effect.

206
00:09:54,605 --> 00:09:57,738
At least the drugs I sell don't
get slurped out of my belly button.

207
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:01,079
- That's only on Tummy Tuesdays! Sorry...
- It's okay to...

208
00:10:01,237 --> 00:10:03,408
Andre left again.

209
00:10:05,783 --> 00:10:09,580
It's not like last time.
He's staying with family.

210
00:10:09,745 --> 00:10:11,916
He took the boys, he took the dog.

211
00:10:12,081 --> 00:10:13,255
He took the DVR.

212
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:16,595
Hundred and sixty-six episodes
of Bones just gone.

213
00:10:17,253 --> 00:10:19,839
It was my fault this time.

214
00:10:20,006 --> 00:10:21,097
I cheated on him...

215
00:10:22,425 --> 00:10:24,097
...with Shirley's Sandwiches.

216
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:29,100
I threw the money into expanding.
I just didn't think I could fail.

217
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,067
Okay.

218
00:10:34,604 --> 00:10:36,443
Well, just so you know...

219
00:10:36,606 --> 00:10:38,112
...this is the sort of stuff...

220
00:10:38,274 --> 00:10:41,620
...that someone could use
to make a claim against a school.

221
00:10:47,658 --> 00:10:50,126
I have to go to the bathroom again.

222
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,294
While I'm gone...

223
00:10:52,455 --> 00:10:54,626
...I want you to think about what I said.

224
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,297
As an exercise.

225
00:11:00,004 --> 00:11:04,476
Do you guys feel weird
about doing this without Magnitude?

226
00:11:10,765 --> 00:11:12,568
That's everything you asked for.

227
00:11:13,184 --> 00:11:15,734
- Who are you flipping?
- My friends...

228
00:11:15,895 --> 00:11:18,196
...who are now the
Save Greendale Committee...

229
00:11:18,356 --> 00:11:19,399
...which I created.

230
00:11:20,733 --> 00:11:21,907
Classic Winger.

231
00:11:22,068 --> 00:11:24,785
I forgot what it was like
to be good at being bad.

232
00:11:24,946 --> 00:11:27,330
So just close the deal
and bring it home to Daddy.

233
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:28,961
Sorry, Alan. Change of daddies.

234
00:11:29,116 --> 00:11:31,620
- I'll take it from here.
- But it's my case.

235
00:11:31,786 --> 00:11:34,170
- Humphries was your case.
- Jeff...

236
00:11:35,498 --> 00:11:36,839
- ...you're scaring me.
- Good.

237
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:38,672
Guys like you should be more scared.

238
00:11:38,835 --> 00:11:42,049
You trust-funded, body-sprayed,
Eli Roth DVD-owner.

239
00:11:42,213 --> 00:11:46,009
You're an amateur monster and you
stomped on the grave of a real monster...

240
00:11:46,175 --> 00:11:49,723
...who was willing to stay buried
because real monsters have shame...

241
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:53,850
...because they wish that... You're not
worth the monologue. Give me your tie.

242
00:11:54,016 --> 00:11:56,946
- What?
- No monologue for you. Give me your tie.

243
00:11:58,187 --> 00:12:00,157
That's for making me go
to this school.

244
00:12:00,314 --> 00:12:02,533
That's for making
the last four years happen.

245
00:12:02,692 --> 00:12:05,076
And now I get to make them
un-happen for me...

246
00:12:05,236 --> 00:12:08,201
...and the only people I care about.

247
00:12:11,784 --> 00:12:14,370
I failed my husband, I failed my kids.

248
00:12:14,537 --> 00:12:16,257
I've failed Bones.

249
00:12:16,414 --> 00:12:19,712
I'm helping to hook a whole new batch
of little Annies on Adderall.

250
00:12:19,876 --> 00:12:23,138
I've spent so much time with computers
your tears are 1s and 0s to me.

251
00:12:23,296 --> 00:12:25,846
Yeah, you were a real
Hallmark card before.

252
00:12:26,007 --> 00:12:29,186
I'm much sadder than the rest of you.

253
00:12:29,552 --> 00:12:31,391
I will figure out why later.

254
00:12:31,554 --> 00:12:33,393
Jeff, full disclosure.

255
00:12:34,557 --> 00:12:37,357
Our lives are worse
than the day we got here.

256
00:12:37,518 --> 00:12:41,231
Well, that is a serious allegation
to arrive at all by yourselves.

257
00:12:41,397 --> 00:12:42,904
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

258
00:12:43,065 --> 00:12:45,367
And we've come to a decision
as a group...

259
00:12:45,526 --> 00:12:48,908
...and please don't judge us
for suggesting it.

260
00:12:49,071 --> 00:12:52,204
- I'll back you up no matter...
- We decided to reenroll at Greendale.

261
00:12:52,366 --> 00:12:53,754
What? Are you nuts?

262
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:57,089
Greendale! Greendale! Greendale!

263
00:12:57,246 --> 00:12:59,583
You guys wanna keep it down?

264
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,090
- Chang?
- Kevin?

265
00:13:04,712 --> 00:13:08,425
Chang. I've dropped the amnesia thing,
copped to my crimes and went to jail.

266
00:13:08,591 --> 00:13:09,765
Now I'm on work release.

267
00:13:09,926 --> 00:13:11,432
- Working as what?
- Math teacher.

268
00:13:11,594 --> 00:13:14,144
- Explain the pyjamas.
- Work release from house arrest...

269
00:13:14,305 --> 00:13:17,402
...but I don't have a home.
See this? This won't let me travel...

270
00:13:17,558 --> 00:13:19,279
...a hundred yards from this.

271
00:13:19,435 --> 00:13:23,907
And this only has a 30-yard cord,
so I can only travel...

272
00:13:24,232 --> 00:13:26,403
- You do the math.
- You said you teach math.

273
00:13:26,567 --> 00:13:28,738
Exactly. I teach it, you do it.

274
00:13:31,113 --> 00:13:34,127
Chang was faking his Changnesia?

275
00:13:34,283 --> 00:13:38,376
Seriously rehired a teacher they fired
for trying to burn down the school?

276
00:13:38,538 --> 00:13:42,595
After being rehired as a guard after
being fired for impersonating a teacher.

277
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,221
That's insane, and I'm Abed.

278
00:13:44,377 --> 00:13:46,216
Worse than insane. Irresponsible.

279
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:48,016
- Evil.
- I don't believe in evil.

280
00:13:48,172 --> 00:13:51,138
But this school clearly got a finger
up its butt as a child.

281
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,937
This place ruins lives.

282
00:13:53,094 --> 00:13:54,565
If that were true...

283
00:13:54,846 --> 00:14:00,018
...then what could we
possibly do about it?

284
00:14:05,314 --> 00:14:06,738
Make them dance, Winger.

285
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:10,496
Jeff, what's your evil
legal nemesis doing here?

286
00:14:10,653 --> 00:14:12,207
Nemesis?

287
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:14,333
No, we were partners again...

288
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:16,788
...until I lost my usefulness.

289
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,832
I may be evil...

290
00:14:18,995 --> 00:14:22,672
...but your friend here
is so much more dangerous.

291
00:14:22,832 --> 00:14:25,513
Tell them how it took you 30 minutes
to make them think...

292
00:14:25,668 --> 00:14:27,839
...they wanted to sue their own school.

293
00:14:30,256 --> 00:14:31,430
I did it.

294
00:14:31,591 --> 00:14:32,718
Sorry.

295
00:14:32,884 --> 00:14:35,849
Anyway, I'll leave you
to pick up these pieces.

296
00:14:36,012 --> 00:14:37,353
I'm gonna go score some blow.

297
00:14:37,513 --> 00:14:39,732
My dealer's a gym teacher here.

298
00:14:49,066 --> 00:14:50,869
You were lying to us?

299
00:14:51,027 --> 00:14:52,830
I never lied to you.

300
00:14:52,987 --> 00:14:55,621
I showed you the right truth.

301
00:14:55,781 --> 00:14:59,044
Britta, when we met,
you were an eclectic anarchist.

302
00:14:59,202 --> 00:15:01,372
How did you become
the group's airhead?

303
00:15:01,537 --> 00:15:03,127
- Thank you?
- And, Shirley...

304
00:15:03,289 --> 00:15:05,590
...you've gone from an
independent divorcée...

305
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,221
...striking out on her own...

306
00:15:07,376 --> 00:15:11,220
...to a bankrupt fry cook
hoping for a call from her husband.

307
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,551
Troy, your entire identity
has been consumed...

308
00:15:13,716 --> 00:15:17,310
- ...by your relationship with another man.
- You found my Clive Owen Tumblr.

309
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,557
What happened to Annie,
unstoppable go-getter?

310
00:15:19,722 --> 00:15:21,561
There was that gas leak last year.

311
00:15:21,724 --> 00:15:23,860
Oh, don't blame it all
on the gas leak year.

312
00:15:24,018 --> 00:15:25,572
This was a four-year process.

313
00:15:25,728 --> 00:15:27,401
We went in one end as real people...

314
00:15:27,563 --> 00:15:29,983
...and out the other end
as mixed-up cartoons.

315
00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:31,537
- Cool.
- Sure.

316
00:15:31,692 --> 00:15:34,243
Coming from the guy who's had
how many psychotic breaks?

317
00:15:34,403 --> 00:15:35,696
Including gas leak year?

318
00:15:35,863 --> 00:15:38,082
You all came here
with a chance to be something.

319
00:15:38,241 --> 00:15:41,871
And you all had that taken away
from you. Get something back.

320
00:15:42,036 --> 00:15:44,290
Seek damages.

321
00:15:44,914 --> 00:15:46,207
Sign here.

322
00:15:46,374 --> 00:15:47,762
But you're our hero.

323
00:15:47,917 --> 00:15:51,096
- I mean, in the commercial...
- The commercial was a lie.

324
00:15:51,254 --> 00:15:53,093
You staged a robot fight?

325
00:15:53,256 --> 00:15:56,602
Yeah. In real life, the robot wins.

326
00:16:02,056 --> 00:16:03,777
Troy?

327
00:16:06,394 --> 00:16:09,941
If Jeff didn't change, then Jeff is right.

328
00:16:10,606 --> 00:16:12,528
Case closed. Let's make some money.

329
00:16:13,276 --> 00:16:16,325
Okay, Jeff, if this is
what you really want to do...

330
00:16:16,487 --> 00:16:17,579
...I'll sign.

331
00:16:17,738 --> 00:16:19,459
The choice to make is yours.

332
00:16:19,615 --> 00:16:21,455
No, it's yours.

333
00:16:23,244 --> 00:16:25,878
We're putting Greendale
in your hands.

334
00:16:34,714 --> 00:16:37,727
- Do we all have to say something?
- No, you can just sign it.

335
00:16:39,635 --> 00:16:41,806
- You brought us together.
- With lies.

336
00:16:41,971 --> 00:16:43,893
But what you do is above lying,
remember?

337
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,442
You show us the right truth.

338
00:16:48,853 --> 00:16:50,823
You won't regret this.

339
00:16:56,652 --> 00:16:59,333
I'd like to take the study room table
in back and burn it.

340
00:16:59,489 --> 00:17:01,161
Burn it? Why?

341
00:17:01,324 --> 00:17:04,836
The same reason I never returned
Time Bandits to Blockbuster.

342
00:17:05,578 --> 00:17:07,001
Nobody else deserves it.

343
00:17:16,172 --> 00:17:17,679
Jesus.

344
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,854
- Looks as if you've lost your way.
- Pierce?

345
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:23,691
Continue on this path,
you might miss your last chance...

346
00:17:23,846 --> 00:17:26,694
...to see the Pierce Hawthorne
Museum of Gender Sensitivity...

347
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:28,854
...and Sexual Potency
on the central quad.

348
00:17:29,018 --> 00:17:30,525
The museum and this hologram...

349
00:17:30,686 --> 00:17:33,023
...were donated in compliance
with a court order...

350
00:17:33,189 --> 00:17:35,111
...I'm not allowed to discuss.

351
00:17:35,274 --> 00:17:37,860
Let's just say some women
can't take a compliment.

352
00:17:38,027 --> 00:17:39,664
Unbelievable.

353
00:17:39,821 --> 00:17:42,538
What I am allowed to discuss
is Greendale.

354
00:17:42,698 --> 00:17:46,210
And I'll say this:
don't turn your back on it.

355
00:17:46,369 --> 00:17:48,872
Take it from a man
with no legal right to be there.

356
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:51,174
You're in a special place.

357
00:17:51,332 --> 00:17:54,464
A crappy place, sure, but only because
it gives crappy people...

358
00:17:54,627 --> 00:17:57,676
...a chance to sort themselves out.

359
00:17:59,006 --> 00:18:01,854
Did I sound gay at the end?
Do you wanna do another take?

360
00:18:03,219 --> 00:18:05,687
- Jeffrey, I'm not decent.
- I know.

361
00:18:05,847 --> 00:18:08,397
These are the signatures
of the five people...

362
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:11,144
...that are crazy enough
to care about this toilet.

363
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:13,730
And tonight, I almost got them
to sue it.

364
00:18:13,896 --> 00:18:16,744
- Heed the warning.
- It's not easy being dean, Jeffrey.

365
00:18:16,899 --> 00:18:18,192
Then stop being the dean.

366
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:20,032
It's my whole ideantity.

367
00:18:20,194 --> 00:18:22,199
I mean... See what I did there?
That's proof.

368
00:18:22,363 --> 00:18:24,617
Get your crap together.

369
00:18:24,782 --> 00:18:26,918
Your job is not to hand out degrees.

370
00:18:27,076 --> 00:18:29,164
Your job is to make this a toilet...

371
00:18:29,328 --> 00:18:31,914
...that people don't have to be crazy
to care about.

372
00:18:32,081 --> 00:18:35,047
But you could stay here
and help me save the school.

373
00:18:35,209 --> 00:18:36,420
For how much money?

374
00:18:36,586 --> 00:18:39,266
I can't offer you any money.
I could offer you a job.

375
00:18:39,422 --> 00:18:40,763
You just described slavery.

376
00:18:40,923 --> 00:18:43,604
I mean, there's nothing in the budget
for school-saver...

377
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:48,185
...but I could hire you as...

378
00:18:50,183 --> 00:18:52,401
Screw you, Abed.

379
00:18:54,896 --> 00:18:56,983
I'd be depressed
if these samples from work...

380
00:18:57,148 --> 00:18:59,153
...weren't giving me
a new outlook on life.

381
00:18:59,317 --> 00:19:03,279
If you're interested in learning more, ask
your doctor if Joyvatrex is right for you.

382
00:19:03,446 --> 00:19:05,118
Oh, honey.

383
00:19:05,281 --> 00:19:07,701
If we sue Greendale,
can I be a surprise witness?

384
00:19:07,867 --> 00:19:10,548
- Wait. Don't tell me.
- Stop.

385
00:19:11,621 --> 00:19:14,089
- We shouldn't sue the school.
- Oh, come on!

386
00:19:14,248 --> 00:19:16,882
Are you trying to give us
emotional whiplash?

387
00:19:17,043 --> 00:19:19,973
Look, if you feel there's more work
to be done on yourselves...

388
00:19:20,129 --> 00:19:24,305
...then as crappy as this place is,
it's a place that you can do it.

389
00:19:24,467 --> 00:19:27,314
- You got a job teaching here.
- I don't wanna talk about it.

390
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:30,732
Well, then, I'm getting back
into forensic science.

391
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:33,820
That was my actual dream.
It's my fault I bailed on it.

392
00:19:33,976 --> 00:19:35,898
A film degree
doesn't make me a filmmaker.

393
00:19:36,062 --> 00:19:37,319
I need to work with others.

394
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,948
- I need to figure out who I am.
- I'll help you.

395
00:19:40,107 --> 00:19:41,828
Get out of my brain.

396
00:19:41,984 --> 00:19:44,155
I need to learn
how to really run a business...

397
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,539
...by my own standards,
not Greendale's.

398
00:19:46,697 --> 00:19:49,415
I'm gonna get a four-year
psych degree, then a master's...

399
00:19:49,575 --> 00:19:51,830
...and become a real psychologist.

400
00:19:51,994 --> 00:19:54,414
Or you could find another major.

401
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,873
A real psychologist.

402
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,294
- How about English?
- Psychology.

403
00:19:58,459 --> 00:20:01,591
All right, what's important
is no matter what...

404
00:20:01,754 --> 00:20:06,263
...we'll be trying to talk Britta into
doing something different together.

405
00:20:10,096 --> 00:20:11,852
Burn, hopelessness.

406
00:20:16,894 --> 00:20:18,152
Oh, my God!

407
00:20:18,312 --> 00:20:20,483
It's a fire! Somebody help us!

408
00:20:22,817 --> 00:20:25,534
Little victories
count for a lot around here.

409
00:20:27,864 --> 00:20:29,417
Good.

410
00:20:29,574 --> 00:20:32,077
Even if you never asked
to win in the first place.

411
00:20:33,703 --> 00:20:36,716
And you have to enjoy
those nice moments while you can.

412
00:20:36,873 --> 00:20:39,553
He does a voice-over wrap-up
at the end of every episode.

413
00:20:39,709 --> 00:20:41,215
Cool.

414
00:20:41,377 --> 00:20:45,090
Because around here,
they never last very long.

415
00:20:45,798 --> 00:20:47,684
Once more. More teacher-y.

416
00:20:47,842 --> 00:20:49,135
I wanna kill myself.

417
00:20:49,302 --> 00:20:50,476
Use that.

418
00:20:57,477 --> 00:20:58,687
Are you a good person?

419
00:20:58,853 --> 00:21:00,146
Yes, unlike you.

420
00:21:00,313 --> 00:21:03,196
I can guarantee,
the Winger beaten you.

421
00:21:03,357 --> 00:21:04,864
Not anymore.

422
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:11,785
