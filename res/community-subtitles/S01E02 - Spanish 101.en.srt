00:00:01,744 --> 00:00:04,174
<i>Good afternoon,
Greendale community college.</i>

2
00:00:04,299 --> 00:00:08,180
<i>I am your dean with a few corrections
to the fall class catalog.</i>

3
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:11,243
<i>Cosmology should be cosmetology,</i>

4
00:00:11,572 --> 00:00:13,572
<i>astrology should be astronomy,</i>

5
00:00:13,871 --> 00:00:16,140
<i>and the students on the cover
should be smiling,</i>

6
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:17,998
<i>but that's a matter of opinion.</i>

7
00:00:18,123 --> 00:00:21,754
<i>Whoever is growing a patch of cannabis
behind the gymnasium,</i>

8
00:00:22,241 --> 00:00:24,657
<i>congratulations.
You have won a cruise.</i>

9
00:00:24,782 --> 00:00:26,693
<i>Report to security
to claim your tickets.</i>

10
00:00:27,908 --> 00:00:29,987
<i>In order to increase
awareness of homelessness,</i>

11
00:00:30,156 --> 00:00:32,052
<i>security has been given binoculars.</i>

12
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:34,061
<i>In campus news,</i>

13
00:00:34,186 --> 00:00:37,036
<i>the debate over our library's PA system
continues</i>

14
00:00:37,161 --> 00:00:39,997
<i>with some students
suggesting its volume be lowered,</i>

15
00:00:40,261 --> 00:00:42,454
<i>while others
question its very purpose.</i>

16
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:44,823
<i>More on that story as it unfolds.</i>

17
00:00:45,422 --> 00:00:47,630
- He makes a lot of announcements.
- I like it,

18
00:00:47,877 --> 00:00:50,216
every ten minutes
feel like a new scene of a tv show.

19
00:00:50,924 --> 00:00:53,987
Illusion only lasts until someone says
something they'd never say on tv

20
00:00:54,112 --> 00:00:56,431
like how much their life is like tv.
There, it's gone.

21
00:00:56,609 --> 00:00:58,433
I guess Jeff's running late again.

22
00:00:58,601 --> 00:01:00,393
What a shame.
We should get started...

23
00:01:01,265 --> 00:01:03,396
We should wait for Jeff
before we start studying.

24
00:01:05,813 --> 00:01:07,138
But when Jeff gets here,

25
00:01:07,263 --> 00:01:09,318
we could talk to him
about his tardiness.

26
00:01:10,106 --> 00:01:11,654
Don't use that word around Abed.

27
00:01:12,483 --> 00:01:15,296
If you want me to have a chat with Jeff,
I'd be happy to do it.

28
00:01:15,421 --> 00:01:18,109
We've got a bond going, kind of.
Sorta like brothers.

29
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:21,330
Hope you didn't take baths together
'cause one of you would've been 30.

30
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:22,707
That's funny.

31
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:26,004
Jeff probably comes late
not to sit through your tardiness.

32
00:01:26,732 --> 00:01:27,732
Sorry.

33
00:01:29,399 --> 00:01:31,233
Will you have some self respect?

34
00:01:31,358 --> 00:01:34,135
You're obsessing over someone
who does not give you a second thought.

35
00:01:34,741 --> 00:01:38,055
In Guatemala, journalists are killed
by their own government.

36
00:01:38,224 --> 00:01:40,057
You jumped a column.
What's happening there?

37
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:43,478
- Nothing.
- Journalists are being murdered?

38
00:01:44,397 --> 00:01:47,791
Believe me, every day in that country,
people are killed for speaking out.

39
00:01:47,916 --> 00:01:49,776
The worst part of it
is when it's over...

40
00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:52,236
- Spoilers.
- It would never even happened.

41
00:01:54,733 --> 00:01:57,562
Real stories...
They don't have spoilers.

42
00:01:57,687 --> 00:02:00,536
You understand that tv and life
are different, right?

43
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,751
- Milady.
- Milord.

44
00:02:07,817 --> 00:02:09,500
- Baby.
- Sweetie.

45
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:11,989
- You smell nice. Vitamin P.
- Morning, Jeffrey.

46
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:14,082
People were jazzed to see me too.

47
00:02:14,207 --> 00:02:15,999
- Word 'em up.
- Word 'em everywhere.

48
00:02:16,124 --> 00:02:18,215
- Good entrance.
- That was for you.

49
00:02:25,886 --> 00:02:28,481
There's something
that the group would like to tell you.

50
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,549
Actually, there's nothing...

51
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:35,224
If you're gonna study with people,
it would be cool to show up on time.

52
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:36,799
Were you waiting?

53
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:40,520
- I just got here.
- Cause you usually spend 20 minutes

54
00:02:40,645 --> 00:02:44,367
talking about your personal lives
and your cool emotional problems.

55
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:46,999
I never have anything to offer.

56
00:02:48,573 --> 00:02:52,263
Truth is my life is emptier
than this three-ring binder.

57
00:02:52,909 --> 00:02:55,091
You have any Spanish notes
that might fit in there?

58
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,094
Double-spaced. Thank you.

59
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,103
What's a guy got to do
to get a C around here?

60
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:04,684
One-liner.

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

62
00:03:34,373 --> 00:03:36,182
Good studying.
See you later. Bye.

63
00:03:38,088 --> 00:03:39,525
You know what today is?

64
00:03:40,102 --> 00:03:42,555
The two-week anniversary
of my horrible first impression.

65
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,640
- There's a card for that?
- Not specifically,

66
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,264
but if you think of grandsons
as a metaphor for friendship,

67
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:49,637
you'll agree
with this transformer here

68
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:51,789
that it's time for ours
to become a man.

69
00:03:51,914 --> 00:03:53,316
By reading from the Torah.

70
00:03:53,782 --> 00:03:56,279
You're harmless to me
cause a life full of ups and downs

71
00:03:56,404 --> 00:03:59,903
has given me douche-ray vision,
but those are good people in there,

72
00:04:00,028 --> 00:04:03,284
and they trust and respect you.
Watching you exploit them bums me out.

73
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:06,712
- Exploit them? They're my friends.
- You want me to bring your car around?

74
00:04:08,677 --> 00:04:10,961
I don't want you
to bring my car around.

75
00:04:11,086 --> 00:04:13,851
I'll bring yours around, good guy.
You get going, all right.

76
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,631
You're cute,

77
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:18,966
but selfish and narcissistic
to the point of near delusion.

78
00:04:21,673 --> 00:04:22,835
She said I was cute.

79
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,139
Tell you what, you take her.
I have less to prove.

80
00:04:25,604 --> 00:04:28,393
You can't pursue people
so desperately.

81
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,148
It starts to creep them out.

82
00:04:30,711 --> 00:04:33,133
Why don't we go get a beer?
I'll give you some advice,

83
00:04:33,258 --> 00:04:35,733
and we can have what the kids calls
a sausage fest.

84
00:04:36,414 --> 00:04:39,403
I'm not much of a sausage guy.
Maybe next time.

85
00:04:40,706 --> 00:04:42,006
Next time, then.

86
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:49,786
- Will you tell us more about Guatemala?
- I never went to a real college.

87
00:04:49,911 --> 00:04:52,545
You should discover that stuff
on your own.

88
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:53,893
But we need your help.

89
00:04:54,018 --> 00:04:56,391
We've been living
on the wrong side of the looking glass.

90
00:04:56,516 --> 00:04:58,673
You're like Jodie Foster
or Susan Sarandon.

91
00:04:59,094 --> 00:05:02,426
- You'd keep it real than be likeable.
- Can you tell us what to google?

92
00:05:02,595 --> 00:05:05,106
You could start
with this journalist Chacata-Panecos.

93
00:05:05,231 --> 00:05:08,714
He wrote an article critical
of the government, and they killed him.

94
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:10,770
- That's horrible.
- Can we have a protest?

95
00:05:10,895 --> 00:05:13,365
- I want to protest something.
- We could have a candlelight vigil

96
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:16,190
- like lesbians have on the news.
- I could make brownies.

97
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,100
Brownies?

98
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,279
Every once in a while,
a student come up to me and ask,

99
00:05:22,937 --> 00:05:25,015
"<i>Señor</i> Chang,
why do you teach Spanish?"

100
00:05:28,776 --> 00:05:30,300
They say it just like that.

101
00:05:30,712 --> 00:05:32,331
"Why do you teach

102
00:05:32,644 --> 00:05:33,644
Spanish?"

103
00:05:35,091 --> 00:05:36,358
"Why you?"

104
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:39,921
Why not math?

105
00:05:43,053 --> 00:05:45,062
Why not photography?

106
00:05:47,143 --> 00:05:48,693
Why not martial arts?

107
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,655
I mean, surely
it must be in my nature

108
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,680
to instruct you in something

109
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,772
that's ancient and secret

110
00:05:56,942 --> 00:05:59,400
like building a wall
that you can see from outer space.

111
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,315
I'll tell you why I teach Spanish.

112
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,640
It is none of your business, okay?

113
00:06:04,969 --> 00:06:07,450
Now, I don't want to have
any conversations

114
00:06:07,619 --> 00:06:11,604
about what a mysterious
and inscrutable man I am.

115
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:19,128
I am a Spanish genius!

116
00:06:20,524 --> 00:06:22,527
In <i>español</i>, my nickname is

117
00:06:22,652 --> 00:06:24,815
"<i>El tigre chino</i>"!

118
00:06:28,268 --> 00:06:30,754
'Cause my knowledge
will bite her face off!

119
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:37,083
So don't question <i>señor</i> Chang
or you'll get bit.

120
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:39,374
Ya bit.

121
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:40,763
Ya bit!

122
00:06:46,182 --> 00:06:49,616
Friday <i>mañana</i>, we'll have conversations
with the rest of the class

123
00:06:49,741 --> 00:06:51,869
using some of the phrases
we learned in unit one.

124
00:06:52,331 --> 00:06:55,556
You'll be partnering up
in pairs of <i>dos</i>.

125
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:59,126
If you look under your desk,

126
00:06:59,295 --> 00:07:01,921
you'll find a card with either a picture
or a word on it.

127
00:07:03,565 --> 00:07:05,576
For <i>ejemplo</i>, blondie <i>aqui</i>

128
00:07:05,701 --> 00:07:08,688
has a card
with a picture of a house on it.

129
00:07:08,813 --> 00:07:12,817
So that means the person with the card
with the word <i>casa</i> on it is her partner.

130
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,392
<i>Comprende</i>, Star-burns?

131
00:07:18,637 --> 00:07:21,565
See you Friday.
Find your partners. Have a great day.

132
00:07:21,735 --> 00:07:24,016
What do we say
at the end of every class?

133
00:07:27,005 --> 00:07:29,253
Come on, hands...
90% of Spanish.

134
00:07:36,976 --> 00:07:38,541
You want to trade cards?

135
00:07:38,937 --> 00:07:40,470
I'll give you 20 bucks.

136
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:45,548
- 50 bucks.
- I don't want your money. Your shirt.

137
00:07:46,312 --> 00:07:48,759
- What?
- I've had my eye on it sincefirst day.

138
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,139
- Fine. Give me your card.
- I want to wear it out of here.

139
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:59,039
What are the odds?

140
00:07:59,164 --> 00:08:01,354
Are you sure
you didn't adjust the odds?

141
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:04,113
I know Abed's been eyeing that shirt
for three weeks.

142
00:08:04,238 --> 00:08:07,001
It's almost like you gave it to him
so he would switch cards.

143
00:08:07,126 --> 00:08:10,182
I gave Abed my shirt
because I'm not selfish,

144
00:08:10,307 --> 00:08:14,033
which is something you'll discover
while we are working on this.

145
00:08:14,537 --> 00:08:16,475
Tomorrow night?
Dinner, drinks.

146
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,421
I think that's something
we should discuss with our partners.

147
00:08:20,134 --> 00:08:22,209
See, I did switch cards.

148
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:28,024
Can you believe this?
What are the odds?

149
00:08:29,123 --> 00:08:31,523
That's a nice shirt.
Want to sell it?

150
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:37,808
What's the moist towelette
industry like?

151
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,575
Believe me,
it's nothing like the product.

152
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,731
It's a hard, dry, large business.

153
00:08:44,095 --> 00:08:45,482
Destroyed all my marriages.

154
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:48,819
It didn't help I can't have children.
I'm not sterile.

155
00:08:49,022 --> 00:08:52,128
In fact, it's a rare condition
they call "hyper-virility".

156
00:08:52,947 --> 00:08:56,515
Apparently my sperm
shoot through the egg like bullets.

157
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,520
- Can you believe that?
- I can't.

158
00:08:58,645 --> 00:09:00,164
But you can, so that's fine.

159
00:09:00,662 --> 00:09:01,945
The assignment is

160
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:05,127
to write a Spanish conversation
using those five phrases.

161
00:09:07,465 --> 00:09:09,006
Hemingway's lemonade.

162
00:09:10,146 --> 00:09:13,218
- No need to make it a long evening...
- Am I a piece of garbage to you?

163
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:14,788
What?

164
00:09:18,732 --> 00:09:19,732
Got ya.

165
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,366
Let's have one drink before we work.

166
00:09:30,162 --> 00:09:31,654
To the "empowerage" of words.

167
00:09:32,156 --> 00:09:34,156
To the irony of that sentence.

168
00:09:36,961 --> 00:09:39,828
So what's up with you, Jeffrey?
Seems like you got a burr up your ass.

169
00:09:43,023 --> 00:09:44,723
I guess that it's...

170
00:09:44,848 --> 00:09:46,377
- It's Britta.
- Forget her.

171
00:09:46,622 --> 00:09:49,804
You just have to know her name.
What is she, a water filter?

172
00:09:50,183 --> 00:09:51,131
She's ugly.

173
00:09:54,272 --> 00:09:56,762
- Why don't we start with me saying...
- What are you doing?

174
00:09:58,198 --> 00:09:59,448
Our assignment.

175
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,769
This is the first time people'll see
Winger and Hawthorne together.

176
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,021
We show them
we're a force to be reckoned with.

177
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,732
Come on,
let's brainstorm some story ideas.

178
00:10:11,282 --> 00:10:14,286
Better yet, before we do that,
let's ask ourselves...

179
00:10:16,677 --> 00:10:19,127
- What is a story?
- My God in heaven.

180
00:10:28,571 --> 00:10:30,963
Like that brownie,
you'll hate what's up on in Guatemala.

181
00:10:31,408 --> 00:10:32,408
Google it.

182
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:35,157
Raise the truth.

183
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,231
Once it gets dark,

184
00:10:37,356 --> 00:10:40,139
I hand out the candles
and we do a speechless protest.

185
00:10:40,478 --> 00:10:41,891
We put tape over our mouths,

186
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:45,144
and gather hand-in-hand
in a sea of outraged silence.

187
00:10:54,478 --> 00:10:56,781
- What with you?
- This ain't how you do this.

188
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:59,325
We know it's not how you do it
cause we're doing everything.

189
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:01,143
But this is tacky and lame.

190
00:11:02,767 --> 00:11:04,015
I didn't mean that.

191
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:05,456
I'm sorry.

192
00:11:05,648 --> 00:11:07,024
What I meant to say

193
00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:09,531
is that this cause
is really personal to me.

194
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:13,172
Are you saying
that we're not allowed to protest?

195
00:11:15,081 --> 00:11:18,093
- You sound like Guatemala.
- Somebody has a case of

196
00:11:18,262 --> 00:11:20,641
"likes to use French politics
to make themselves special,

197
00:11:20,766 --> 00:11:23,139
"but doesn't actually ever want to do
anything-itis."

198
00:11:23,309 --> 00:11:24,409
I do things.

199
00:11:25,486 --> 00:11:26,586
I went to...

200
00:11:28,965 --> 00:11:30,752
I don't do anything.

201
00:11:33,194 --> 00:11:34,277
What can I do?

202
00:11:36,244 --> 00:11:38,029
You hang the Chacata-Panecos piñata.

203
00:11:38,611 --> 00:11:40,908
You guys realize
he was beaten to death, right?

204
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:42,850
That's where we got the idea from.

205
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,975
Poignant.

206
00:11:50,525 --> 00:11:53,193
- Tell me what I've got so far.
- What we have so far?

207
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:56,177
We have something incredibly long,

208
00:11:56,302 --> 00:11:58,591
and very confusing,
and a little homophobic.

209
00:11:59,167 --> 00:12:01,010
And really, really, specifically,

210
00:12:01,135 --> 00:12:03,848
surprisingly,
and gratuitously critical of Israel.

211
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,918
It's called "two conquistadors",
should probably be "<i>dos</i>".

212
00:12:07,043 --> 00:12:08,701
I mean, it is a Spanish class.

213
00:12:08,826 --> 00:12:11,897
Which reminds me,
the only thing not included in this

214
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:15,401
are the five phrases required
to get me a passing grade.

215
00:12:16,979 --> 00:12:18,611
You're right.
Needs more work.

216
00:12:18,882 --> 00:12:21,032
- What're you guys doing?
- I have no idea.

217
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:23,409
- We head to the demonstration.
- Hippies?

218
00:12:23,578 --> 00:12:26,666
- Some cause Britta's into.
- A silent protest. Lots of candles.

219
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:29,350
Gets the ladies in the mood
for social change.

220
00:12:29,475 --> 00:12:33,325
- A chance to put miles on this shirt.
- Conversations are due in the morning.

221
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:36,541
Right.

222
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,035
What do you want to do?

223
00:12:50,354 --> 00:12:51,354
Hacks.

224
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:55,356
What do we do
about the ending of act two?

225
00:12:55,735 --> 00:12:57,260
I tell you what we're gonna do.

226
00:12:57,691 --> 00:13:01,489
We gonna take this, and we gonna put it
in a museum for crazy people.

227
00:13:02,292 --> 00:13:03,792
Then we're gonna take this,

228
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:07,732
and memorize five phrases from it
tomorrow morning before class.

229
00:13:07,857 --> 00:13:09,907
- Good night.
- Wait a minute.

230
00:13:10,032 --> 00:13:12,168
You're bailing
on our first sausage fest?

231
00:13:12,293 --> 00:13:14,484
This is
your definition of friendship?

232
00:13:14,609 --> 00:13:17,701
This is my definition
of you trying way too hard,

233
00:13:17,826 --> 00:13:20,604
and me finding it harder and harder
to stay polite.

234
00:13:20,729 --> 00:13:23,511
Now this was a fine enough way
to spend an evening devoid of hope,

235
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:25,471
but a woman I kind of like

236
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:28,339
is out there
caring about something stupid,

237
00:13:28,566 --> 00:13:32,570
and this is my chance to show her
I care enough to act like I care too.

238
00:13:33,356 --> 00:13:35,609
- That's all you had to say.
- That was it?

239
00:13:35,734 --> 00:13:38,526
That would've been great
if I had done that two hours ago!

240
00:14:21,424 --> 00:14:22,278
Nice sign.

241
00:14:24,361 --> 00:14:26,154
I like what you've done
with the place.

242
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,041
I think
I was a little too harsh on you.

243
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,466
I'm not perfect.

244
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,874
I am.
I'd be happy to show you the ropes.

245
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:36,332
Awesome!

246
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:40,213
Look at awesome Jeffrey Winger.

247
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:42,908
Too awesome for old Pierce

248
00:14:43,033 --> 00:14:44,641
with your hip shirts,

249
00:14:45,587 --> 00:14:47,094
and your gelled hair,

250
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:48,960
and your cool

251
00:14:49,325 --> 00:14:50,875
tape over your mouth.

252
00:14:52,126 --> 00:14:54,101
Why are you wearing tape
over their mouth?

253
00:14:54,606 --> 00:14:55,811
It's a protest.

254
00:14:56,293 --> 00:14:57,089
Good.

255
00:14:57,602 --> 00:14:59,603
Cause I know
what I'd like to protest...

256
00:14:59,728 --> 00:15:01,039
How much you hurt me.

257
00:15:01,164 --> 00:15:04,728
Conflicts like these will ultimately
bring us together as an unlikely family.

258
00:15:04,853 --> 00:15:08,611
- You have horrible breath right now.
- You constantly blow me off,

259
00:15:08,736 --> 00:15:10,159
you want me to do your homework,

260
00:15:10,649 --> 00:15:14,080
you tell me I'm trying too hard
to be your friend so you have to go.

261
00:15:14,398 --> 00:15:16,809
You have to come out here to pretend

262
00:15:16,934 --> 00:15:20,127
to care about the stupid stuff
she cares about.

263
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,214
- His words, not mine.
- He is paraphrasing.

264
00:15:23,778 --> 00:15:25,103
Pierce, I got an idea.

265
00:15:25,228 --> 00:15:26,405
Get a coffee,

266
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:29,345
hold some waitress hostage
with a monologue about your sperm.

267
00:15:29,714 --> 00:15:31,816
I'll show you some sperm, buddy.

268
00:15:32,217 --> 00:15:35,224
Was this your idea?
What the hell? Fire.

269
00:15:36,812 --> 00:15:38,105
I'm not ready to die.

270
00:15:41,945 --> 00:15:43,962
He's jumped in the fountain.

271
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:45,666
He's fine.

272
00:15:53,245 --> 00:15:55,916
- Have you seen it?
- We did it, girl... Page three.

273
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,228
Mostly about Pierce,
but listen to last paragraph.

274
00:15:58,353 --> 00:16:01,604
"The incident occurred during a protest
regarding events in Guatemala."

275
00:16:01,729 --> 00:16:03,605
- Awareness!
- It's not the school paper.

276
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,881
It's a real paper,
there's a marmaduke in there.

277
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:07,924
It's more than I ever accomplished.

278
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:09,968
You know
about the ethnic cleansing in Burma?

279
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:12,087
Need to bust out brownie mix.

280
00:16:16,981 --> 00:16:17,981
Morning.

281
00:16:20,822 --> 00:16:23,225
I get it.
Garfield's wishing me a happy Arbor Day,

282
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,192
- you'd like a fresh start.
- Nice try.

283
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,841
It's secretary's day, and it says
I'm sorry about crashing your protest

284
00:16:28,966 --> 00:16:31,198
with that drunken,
self-immolating baby boomer.

285
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:33,730
We don't blame you.
He has always been on my watch list.

286
00:16:33,855 --> 00:16:36,357
That dude is crazy...
He told me girls have two pee holes.

287
00:16:36,482 --> 00:16:38,664
I sang Christmas carols
at a nursing home once.

288
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,917
I've seen the face of dementia,
and last night I saw it again.

289
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:45,123
You know what he did
that's really crazy?

290
00:16:46,102 --> 00:16:49,495
He offered me $100
to switch cards with him

291
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,802
just so he could be
partners with Jeff.

292
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:56,041
He thought getting closer to Jeff
would bring him respect in the group.

293
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:59,601
I think he spent his whole life
looking out for himself

294
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:03,312
and he would trade it all
for a shot at some kind of family.

295
00:17:12,681 --> 00:17:14,157
Time for our presentations.

296
00:17:14,414 --> 00:17:16,907
First up was supposed to be
Jeff and Pierce,

297
00:17:17,032 --> 00:17:19,179
but Pierce explained the situation.

298
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:23,165
Apparently there was a falling out,
things were said, people were betrayed.

299
00:17:24,881 --> 00:17:27,003
Jeff, having heard
Pierce's side of the story,

300
00:17:27,695 --> 00:17:30,298
the only humane thing to do
would be to give you a C

301
00:17:30,468 --> 00:17:33,521
and let him do his presentation alone,
if that sounds fair to you.

302
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,324
That doesn't sound fair
to me at all.

303
00:17:42,063 --> 00:17:44,271
I understand
if you don't want to be my friend,

304
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:46,106
but this thing we've created...

305
00:17:46,611 --> 00:17:48,722
It is bigger than the both of us,

306
00:17:48,847 --> 00:17:51,512
and it deserves to be done right.

307
00:17:54,218 --> 00:17:55,218
All right.

308
00:17:58,852 --> 00:18:01,627
Why are there costumes involved?
These are short conversations,

309
00:18:01,752 --> 00:18:04,082
- they're not supposed to take...
- Your breath away?

310
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:06,543
Well, tough.

311
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:08,729
You ready, <i>amigo</i>?

312
00:19:32,168 --> 00:19:32,976
F.

313
00:19:33,576 --> 00:19:34,381
F-minus.

314
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:36,207
What?

315
00:19:37,724 --> 00:19:39,052
Did you say S?

316
00:19:43,402 --> 00:19:44,143
So.

317
00:19:45,815 --> 00:19:48,061
That was one of the worst things
I have ever seen,

318
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:51,911
which I guess makes being a part of it
a pretty selfless act,

319
00:19:52,036 --> 00:19:53,490
so I'm impressed.

320
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:56,816
How do you know I didn't do it
just to get another shot at you?

321
00:19:56,941 --> 00:19:58,830
Cause a smart guy like you
would know

322
00:19:58,955 --> 00:20:02,420
no woman would be able to look at you
as a sexually viable candidate

323
00:20:02,545 --> 00:20:03,535
ever again.

324
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:06,913
No, I know.

325
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,324
I thought of that.

326
00:20:09,662 --> 00:20:10,962
She looked back.

327
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:17,258
You did an all right job up there,
my friend.

328
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,735
You got this thing you do with your face
when you're trying to be funny

329
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:25,460
that forces people to think
about how cool you think you are.

330
00:20:42,944 --> 00:20:45,540

331
00:20:45,665 --> 00:20:48,132
{\My name is T-Bone
the disco spider.}

332
00:20:48,257 --> 00:20:50,915

333
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,658

334
00:20:53,783 --> 00:20:56,289

335
00:20:56,414 --> 00:20:59,250
{\head is ice cream,
beer is good}

336
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,872

337
00:21:01,997 --> 00:21:04,811
{\the goat's mustache
is Cameron Diaz.}

338
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:09,182
It's 2009.

339
00:21:09,588 --> 00:21:10,420
Word.

340
00:21:11,305 --> 00:21:17,582
