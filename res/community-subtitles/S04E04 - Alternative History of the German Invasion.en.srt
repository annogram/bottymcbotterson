1
00:00:03,921 --> 00:00:04,921
Look, 12:00.

2
00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:07,216
History of Ice Cream class
is letting out.

3
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:10,969
- It's as informative as it is delicious.
- That class should've been ours.

4
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:13,388
I hear the final is a sundae bar.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,201
I don't get history. If I wanted
to know what happened in Europe...

6
00:00:16,225 --> 00:00:18,644
a long time ago,
I'd watch Game of Thrones.

7
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:22,105
That show takes place in a fantasy
realm. This is about the real world.

8
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:26,109
- Not the show.
- You need to think before you speak.

9
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,780
I hear this teacher's a real hard-ass.
He's British and has a degree.

10
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:32,658
I can't have a hard-buns teacher.
I'm starting a business.

11
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,203
When am I supposed to see my family?
Ben took his first steps without me.

12
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:38,539
Quick impression... who am I?
You guys.

13
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:39,830
Dead on.

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,501
I know The History of Ice Cream
would have been fun...

15
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:46,755
but not only will this class be much
less likely to give us type 2 diabetes...

16
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,674
we might actually learn so...

17
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:49,966
Son of a bitch.

18
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:53,303
Those annoying Germans are back?

19
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:56,356
I thought they transferred after
they lost their foosball scholarship.

20
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,641
I heard they were juicing.

21
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:00,561
No, them leaving would mean
Greendale got slightly better...

22
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:03,188
which, as we know,
does not happen.

23
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:06,108
Lukas, Karl,
I see you've grown a new douche bag.

24
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,859
My name is Reinhold.

25
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,529
I believe you know my brother,
Juergen.

26
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:13,782
There was some bad blood
between you two, ja?

27
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,199
Don't worry.

28
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,203
If there is one thing Germans don't do,
it's hold a grudge.

29
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:21,206
- Unless we're talking Die Hard 3.
- Or the 20th century.

30
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:23,499
Morning, everyone.

31
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,793
Morning, sir.

32
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,713
I am Professor Cornwallis.

33
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:32,718
I know what you're all thinking,
and the answer is yes.

34
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:37,556
I am a direct descendant
of General Sir Charles Cornwallis...

35
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:40,350
who surrendered the British forces
at Yorktown.

36
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:42,644
- Was anyone thinking that?
- No.

37
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,813
History is written by the victors.

38
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,400
Of course, we all know the quote.

39
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:51,194
What does it mean?
According to Oxford University...

40
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:55,198
it means that my 20 years'
loyal service there...

41
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:59,745
means nothing
next to a little slipup with a coed.

42
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:02,914
But what it really means...

43
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:07,294
is that history can be seen
from a multitude of vantage points.

44
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:09,671
So for your first test on Monday...

45
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,088
Oh, come on.

46
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,175
I'm confused.
When do we get our ice cream?

47
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:17,262
I want to challenge you
to look at history from all perspectives.

48
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:22,267
How would the story read
if it was written not by the victors...

49
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,727
but by the vanquished?

50
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:29,107
Ja, how indeed?

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,074

52
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:42,454
I was recalling a very funny episode
of the German version of The Nanny.

53
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,623
Franlein gets a...

54
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:46,792
It wouldn't translate.

61
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:17,447
And I still have those pants.
True story.

62
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,324
Oh, we have fun.

63
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,285
Sorry. I should've realised
that might be startling.

64
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,831
Dr. Ken Kedan, Greater Greendale
Mental Health Services.

65
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:29,000
Kevin, does this gentleman
look familiar to you?

66
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:31,670
I'm sorry. He doesn't.

67
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:35,006
Kevin? His name is Chang.

68
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:38,343
Oh, of course.
That explains the note.

69
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,806
"Hello, my name is Kevin.
I have Changnesia"? What is that?

70
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:44,933
Not uncommon for victims
of memory loss...

71
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,770
to experience syntactical confusion.
Thus, the inappropriate insertion of...

72
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,524
- his name into an unrelated phrase.
- No, he's always dean that.

73
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:55,318
Once we learned of the connection
to Greendale, we realised...

74
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,850
it'd be the perfect environment
for immersive therapy.

75
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:00,532
What? No, absolutely not.

76
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:05,036
I can't have an unbalanced nut job
traipsing around on my campus.

77
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,790
Put that on the rack, put that
in the fridge. Get him out of here.

78
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,543
Sorry. Your school board
already signed off on it.

79
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:13,336
Kevin is now your responsibility.

80
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:21,052
- I just felt a disturbance.
- Did you have dairy this morning?

81
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,805
Could be that.
Or it could be that great evil is nearby.

82
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,099
I'll take a provisional Lactaid.

83
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:27,934
Won't be needing the Lactaid.

84
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,188
Guys, this is our study room.

85
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,791
Please leave. And take that
mushroom cloud of Drakkar with you.

86
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:37,652
Why must he hurt so with his words?
He's like a less funny Hans Rickles.

87
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,572
I'm not here to argue, Angela Jerk-els.
Beat it.

88
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,700
Someone must've changed
the channel to USA...

89
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,827
because I just watched
a Burn Notice.

90
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,330
Who's Angela Jerk-els?

91
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:51,666
I can assure you, we are here
for no reason other than to study.

92
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,045
Our usual off-campus haunt,
Der Kaffee Hausen is closed...

93
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:57,214
for the shooting
of an esoteric art film.

94
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:58,632
Tomorrow it shall reopen...

95
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:02,052
und we shall be out
of your heavily product-laden hair.

96
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:07,015
Jeff, it's just a little table
in the corner of the room.

97
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,185
- Why don't we just let them have it?
- That's called appeasement.

98
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:13,396
And everyone knows if you give
the Germans something small...

99
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,273
like the study room or Austria...

100
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,734
they end up wanting something big,
like Earth.

101
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:21,613
Jeff's right. If there were more people
in the world like Annie...

102
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,865
we'd all be speaking Vietnamese
right now.

103
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,157
That was my war.

104
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,410
I had fiashbacks for years.

105
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:31,373
- Pierce, you moved to Canada.
- And it was hell.

106
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,458
Those people call ham "bacon."

107
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,836
This is silly.
I'm just gonna walk over there...

108
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:39,172
and tell them they are welcome
to share our room.

109
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,465
Delightful.

110
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,801
So today, we study in here.

111
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:44,636
Und tonight, we dine in hell.

112
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:52,394
Doktor Blitz,
Knight of the Atlantis Guild...

113
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,846
wielder of the four-pronged
trident in "Spawncraft."

114
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:58,316
- How did you know?
- I recognised your catchphrase:

115
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,652
"Tonight we dine in hell!"
I'm Spacetimer 8032.

116
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:04,239
- You are Spacetimer 8032?
- The one and only.

117
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:07,242
It's wonderful to meet you, brother.

118
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:15,000
What was that all about?
You two seemed pretty chummy.

119
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,168
That man saved my life.

120
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,753
In a video game.

121
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,464
Let me get this as straight
as I can get things.

122
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:25,302
You authorised this? After everything
that happened last year?

123
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:26,594
Hear us out.

124
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,179
They offered money.

125
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,974
Did it ever occur to you
that this man is a psychopath...

126
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,101
who may be faking
his own Changnesia?

127
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,393
Now he has me saying it.

128
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,188
Amdeansia. Amdeansia.
I'm all turned around.

129
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,608
If he is faking,
you're welcome to prove it.

130
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,152
We get the money either way.

131
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:44,237
Oh, I will prove it.

132
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:47,115
And I'll have fun doing it.

133
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,326
Now, what to wear?

134
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:54,706
See? I know those guys
were annoying yesterday...

135
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:58,627
but aren't you glad we didn't turn it
into a whole big macho war thing?

136
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,879
You're right.
I can't believe I doubted you.

137
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:04,799
Hey, what's that sound you make
when you see something shocking?

138
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,385
- Yeah, that's it.
- What are you doing at our table?

139
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,721
What happened
to Der Kaffee Hausen?

140
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:13,016
Our time in this room yesterday
proved more pleasant than expected.

141
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:14,809
It's got a good energy.

142
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:18,897
That table is ours. This room is ours.
You guys need to leave.

143
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:20,523
- Hey, Karl.
- Hi, Abed.

144
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,236
I am afraid it is you
who must do the making like a tree...

145
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,906
which is to say leaving. Security.

146
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,742
- You want us to leave?
- There a problem here?

147
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:34,162
Yeah. These Düssel-dorks won't
leave our study room.

148
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,748
Nice. I don't understand
any of these puns.

149
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,709
- I think I need to learn history.
- You have a sign-in sheet?

150
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,753
You're asking for our papers?

151
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:43,838
I thought this was America,
not Arizona.

152
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,757
We have a sign-in sheet. Lukas.

153
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:50,136
Perhaps we should all just go home
and see our families...

154
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:51,596
and think things through?

155
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,682
Looks like the room is theirs.

156
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:59,020
Shirley, call your babysitter,
because this means...

157
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,397
Let me guess.

158
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:01,689
War?

159
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,859
- Let the lady finish her sentence.
- Thank you, Jeff.

160
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:06,945
War. Yeah.

161
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,668
We'd like to sign out Study Room F.

162
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,463
It would appear that in this battle,
our bulge was a little bit bigger.

163
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,799
Guten bye-bye. Excuse me.
Don't touch.

164
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,927
Damn them
and their perfectly crafted timepieces.

165
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,554
What else do you have available?

166
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,645
It's like a Darren Aronofsky film.

167
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:44,107
I'll get this. My fifth father-in-law
was an electrician.

168
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,109
You pick up a thing or two.

169
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,321
Everybody grab me, please!

170
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,657
Nobody grab him.

171
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,659
Pierce, just let go.

172
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,579
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?
- Of the thing, Pierce.

173
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,164
It smells like barbecue.

174
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:00,999
We're getting up earlier tomorrow.

175
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,449
Oh, look at them.

176
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,891
Hi.

177
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:01,851
Thanks again for taking me in.

178
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:05,063
We must have been great pals
before my Changnesia, huh?

179
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:08,650
Oh, my... That's it. You may
have fooled that handsome doctor...

180
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,068
but you can't fool me.

181
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,444
Oh, how convenient.

182
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,739
Showing up here with Changnesia
after you staged a coup...

183
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,658
almost blew up the school...

184
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,536
and locked me in a basement
for months.

185
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:22,038
Without so much as a drop
of moisturizer.

186
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,666
I did all that?
I mean, Chang did all that?

187
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:30,630
If that's true, then Chang, who is me,
deserves to go to jail.

188
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:31,922
Well, he did.

189
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,258
And you do.

190
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:37,762
This is the worst thing that's happened
to me in my 96 hours of memory.

191
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:44,352
And that failed ventriloquist's name
was Slobodan Milošević.

192
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:45,811
- Oh, yeah.
- Yes.

193
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,439
For the essay portion of your test
on Monday...

194
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:51,442
you will be asked to describe
a historical battle...

195
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,362
from the perspectives
of both the winners and the losers.

196
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:56,447
No dioramas.

197
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,370
Guten luck on the examination.
We will be preparing for it...

198
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,789
in Study Room F, as in "fictory."

199
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,126
I like the way your old chair cradles
mein k'naidels.

200
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,712
I just made that up.

201
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,505
English is my second language.

202
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,424
Jeff, stop.

203
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:16,384
- It's over.
- No.

204
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,303
These guys are horrible.

205
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:20,972
- Totally. Except Karl.
- Really, Abed?

206
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,558
Karl's not horrible?
Even though he took your home?

207
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,977
When I was growing up,
it was just me and my mom.

208
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:29,647
I didn't have much of a family,
that is, until I met you guys.

209
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:33,026
So excuse me if I'm not willing
to give up the place...

210
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,612
where we became a family.

211
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:39,490
So, what are we gonna do?
We literally can't get up any earlier.

212
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:44,412
Many years ago, before the concept
of "too soon" existed...

213
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:48,458
there was a show about a bunch of
goofy Nazis running a prison camp...

214
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,877
- and that show was called...
- Hogan's Heroes?

215
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:52,795
- Hogan's Heroes.
- Yeah.

216
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:56,424
And while, for a latchkey kid
with no Jewish friends...

217
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,801
it was a bit desensitizing...

218
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:04,015
it still taught me
that the loveable misfits always win...

219
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,351
and the bumbling Germans
always lose.

220
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:10,521
All we need is a clever ruse...
Strike that. All we need is a ruse.

221
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:12,023
You had me at "ruse."

222
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,026
- That was the last thing I said.
- Good thing you said it.

223
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:29,374
Welcome to Oktoberfest.

224
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,709
- What is this?
- Call it a peace offering.

225
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:35,171
You won, we lost.
Let's end this dumb war and move on.

226
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:38,549
Care for some authentic blutwurst?
This stuff's the real deal.

227
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:42,303
We got it down in Little Munich.
It's been banned by the FDA.

228
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:45,390
No, Karl.
That blutwurst was probably injected...

229
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:48,893
with a laxative to make us
pull a Grete Waitz in our trousers.

230
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,854
I promise you, there's nothing gross
in this sausage.

231
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,649
It's just pig's blood
stuffed into a cow's intestine.

232
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:58,528
Gott,
that must be nearly 100 luftballons.

233
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:00,571
Idiot. Do not accept their gifts.

234
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,699
Something is clearly up.

235
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:05,326
Please, these are just small tokens
of our friendship.

236
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,663
Oh, come on.
Dirndls, blutwurst, luftballons.

237
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,999
A cartoonishly large cake.

238
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,458
This is a ruse.

239
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,253
It is exactly like an episode
of Hogan's Villains.

240
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,463
Ruse? This is no ruse.

241
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:20,008
Just take that large cake
back to the study room...

242
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,300
and enjoy it there.

243
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:25,346
So there's nothing hiding inside
this giant German chocolate cake?

244
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,638
Ask Abed.

245
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,599
You can trust him. He's a friend.

246
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,520
Nope. Just solid cake.

247
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:38,276
Then you wouldn't mind
if I cut the cake?

248
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:40,778
Or save it for later.
You don't have to share it.

249
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,364
Shirley stayed up all night
baking that for you.

250
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,534
I just used the eggs I would've used
for my son's breakfast.

251
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:50,663
But it would be so easy for me
to carve into this cake...

252
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:51,955
and serve us all.

253
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:53,206
Wait!

254
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,794
Damn it. Sorry. We thought
you were stupider than this.

255
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,671
Troy.

256
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:05,470
Should I release the tear gas
or has that ship sailed?

257
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:09,807
An excellent attempt, Winger,
but we are smarter than you.

258
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,809
And once again, it shall be us...

259
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:15,897
who are savouring the smooth
and somewhat hoppy taste of victory.

260
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,315
Beer me, bitte.

261
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,359
Here you go.

262
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,653
As they say in Ferris Bueller,
"dankeschön."

263
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,572
And as they say
in the movie Gotcha!:

264
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,157
Gotcha.

265
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:31,162
- Busted.
- Busted? For what?

266
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:34,457
But there were dozens of students
at that Oktoberfest.

267
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,459
But you were the only
German students...

268
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:38,002
celebrating German culture.

269
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,505
And here at Greendale,
that is a big fat no-no.

270
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:44,258
We frown on anyone celebrating
their own cultural heritage.

271
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:48,388
I mean, if the Hasidic Student Union
wants to host a Kwanzaa celebration...

272
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,679
you go, Jews.

273
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,682
Hanukkah? No, sir.

274
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:55,186
It's why I keep a detailed list
of every student's race and nationality.

275
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,647
To prevent racism and nationalism.

276
00:14:57,939 --> 00:14:59,190
This is an outrage.

277
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:01,192
Relax. It's not like you're expelled.

278
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:04,112
You're just banned
from certain campus amenities.

279
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,863
Water fountains, swimming pools.

280
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:09,158
Most of these are water-based.
Oh, and the study rooms.

281
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,704
I gotta take this. Bye-bye.

282
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:19,085
Dean Pelton. If I don't offer you
a receipt, your education is free.

283
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,045
Chang did what?

284
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,558
Oh, cool.

285
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:34,850
What are we protesting?

286
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,812
You guys. You've been hogging
that study room for three years.

287
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,731
Somebody finally stood up to you,
and you had them banned.

288
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,526
Why must our people
always be the victims?

289
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:45,695
- What do we want?
- Justice!

290
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:47,067
- When do we want it?
- Now!

291
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:48,906
- What do we want?
- Justice!

292
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,408
Oh, my God.

293
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,411
This whole time we thought
the Germans were the Germans...

294
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:57,540
but it turns out,
we're the Germans.

295
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:04,130
Hang on. You guys are all siding
with the Germans?

296
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:06,924
You realise these guys are, like,
contractor-grade tools.

297
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,385
They signed out that room
fair and square...

298
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:13,723
and then you had to take it too far,
like you always do with that room.

299
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:15,516
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

300
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,271
Damn it!

301
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:22,440
I signed this room out!

302
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,108
And I have a final tomorrow!

303
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,693
They lost a pen.

304
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,281
Come back in a few hours,
we're playing "Dungeons & Dragons."

305
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:32,742
- Yes?
- I left my notebook.

306
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:35,870
Come back later.
I'm trying to prove a point.

307
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,373
You're like those guys
on Hogan's Heroes, the Nazis.

308
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,001
You take that back.

309
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:43,293
I'm Jewish.

310
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,588
Yeah, Leonard. Don't call me a Nazi.

311
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,757
You are wearing an SS T-shirt.

312
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:55,056
Open 2.

313
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:03,314
- What are you doing here?
- You, sir, have been bailed out.

314
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:06,609
We are going to nurse you
back to health.

315
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:10,655
But why? Why take me back in
after everything I did to you?

316
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:14,450
When I heard you had checked into
jail, I realised you couldn't be faking.

317
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:17,828
The real Chang would never
have remorse for what he did.

318
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,665
I believe you, Kevin.

319
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,710
Plus, curing Changnesia,
that's a human-interest story.

320
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,505
Puts Greendale on the map.
But your health comes second...

321
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:29,048
First, to the school.

322
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,633
Oh, let's not hug.

323
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:32,552
Do you mind getting my...? Okay.

324
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:35,096
Probably shouldn't step on it.

325
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,557
I feel guilty eating this cake.

326
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,183
And not for the usual reasons.

327
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:41,936
This is what happens
when a group of people...

328
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,855
blindly follows a charismatic
golden-throated leader.

329
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,816
Are you comparing me to Hitler?

330
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:48,401
- Yeah.
- There are similarities.

331
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:50,987
Hang on.
Nobody's even willing to consider...

332
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:53,406
that I might be the Hitler
of this group?

333
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:56,826
We were the good guys. How could
everybody think we're the bad guys?

334
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:59,870
We are. When Karl and I were raiding
the Diamond North Caves...

335
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,164
I was facing 50 death beetles.
He saved me.

336
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:05,543
When I had a chance to return
the favour, I told him it was solid cake.

337
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,336
You were just following orders.

338
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,714
There's probably a way
I can make it up to him.

339
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:14,010
- I'll give him my four-pronged trident.
- Why not call it a quadrident?

340
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,305
There you people are.

341
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:20,016
I believe we have something
to discuss.

342
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:25,146
Oh, my God.
You clever British bastard.

343
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,898
- You set this up to teach us a lesson.
- What?

344
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,984
Making the school pretend
to hate us...

345
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:33,070
to show us that one man's hero
is another man's villain.

346
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:36,407
Of course. We aren't Nazis.

347
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:39,201
I tip my cap to you, sir.
Lesson learned.

348
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:42,413
Are you actually suggesting
that a professor at Greendale...

349
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:46,876
would set up an elaborate ruse
just to teach seven students a lesson?

350
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:49,337
- Yes.
- That's a Wednesday.

351
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:50,755
Oh, my God.

352
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:53,341
I've made a terrible mistake
coming here.

353
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:56,927
So this wasn't part of the class?

354
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,429
Then why are you here?

355
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:00,848
You had a test today,
and you all missed it.

356
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,183
F's for everyone.

357
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:07,772
Maybe it's not too late
to get out of my contract.

358
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,692
- I really am Hitler.
- Yeah.

359
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,278
So it's just decided?

360
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,946
No vote or anything?

361
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:20,117
I hate this. I wish there was a way
that we could make it up to people.

362
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:22,119
That's it.

363
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,621
We need to make reparations.

364
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,624
We have to start giving back...

365
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:30,127
because Greendale has given us
so much.

366
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,129
It gave us the study room.

367
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,965
And that study room is our home.

368
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:40,638
But our home
is more than those four walls.

369
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:45,518
And our family
is more than the seven of us.

370
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,896
It's all of Greendale.

371
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:54,151
And everyone deserves to have
what we have.

372
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:59,490
What do you know?
Greendale just got slightly better.

373
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,202
It's good to be back.

374
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,330
Should we go celebrate
at Skeeper's?

375
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,457
Oh, come on, Shirley.
We all have lives.

376
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:12,461
There you are. I am so proud how
you stepped up and made amends.

377
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,755
And everyone forgave you.

378
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,799
Because when it comes
right down to it...

379
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:18,509
Greendale's a forgiving place.

380
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:19,801
It really is.

381
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:21,595
Keep that in mind
the next 20 seconds.

382
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,140
- Remember that people can Chang.
- People can what?

383
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:27,308
Hi, I'm Kevin.

384
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,356
He has Changnesia.

385
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:38,446
- And you know what that sound is.
- It's the Troy and Abed podcast.

386
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,298
Sponsored by Shirley's Sandwiches,
home of the fried-chicken skin wrap.

387
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,116
Is it inside? Is it outside?
You find out.

388
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:45,536
- Our guest today is from Germany.
- Karl, guten tag. How are you doing?

389
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,372
Great.
Now's the part where we get real.

390
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,499
Friendship, loyalty,
betrayal, redemption.

391
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,501
- Is this an apology?
- Yes.

392
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,962
For being a guest,
we want you to have this.

393
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:59,467
Gift certificate to Shirley's Sandwiches,
home of the triple-fried Monte Cristo.

394
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,887
- We challenge you to taste the bread.
- This coupon is a $5 bill.

395
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:05,890
That's all the time we have.
For Troy Barnes, I'm Abed Nadir.

396
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:07,558
For Abed Nadir, I'm Troy Barnes.

397
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,435
- And we're out.
- And we're out.

398
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,352
Thanks for doing this.

399
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,397
So will you be
on my podcast tomorrow?

400
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,274
We've got a thing.

400
00:21:16,305 --> 00:21:22,808
