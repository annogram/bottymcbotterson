1
00:00:08,899 --> 00:00:12,362
Please stay for complimentary saltines
and full-price sodas.

2
00:00:12,527 --> 00:00:16,158
But first, the dulcet tones
of The Bennett Boys.

3
00:00:18,158 --> 00:00:22,298
When you were here before

4
00:00:23,038 --> 00:00:27,677
Couldn't look you in the eye

5
00:00:34,174 --> 00:00:37,638
Hey, bro, free crackers. Wanna
spend your life opening lockers?

6
00:00:37,802 --> 00:00:40,816
You don't have to raise your voice!
I'm going as fast as I can!

7
00:00:44,017 --> 00:00:46,354
Oh, great, now I have
these folders to deal with!

8
00:00:47,354 --> 00:00:49,406
Et tu, pencil?

9
00:00:50,857 --> 00:00:52,743
When it rains, it pours.

11
00:01:04,037 --> 00:01:06,885
Ass Crack Bandit!

12
00:01:40,282 --> 00:01:40,447
Okay. Let's settle down!
Guys, what is known...

13
00:01:40,448 --> 00:01:43,912
Okay. Let's settle down!
Guys, what is known...

14
00:01:44,077 --> 00:01:47,459
What's known is that
around noon yesterday...

15
00:01:47,622 --> 00:01:49,710
...an unidentified student
dropped a coin...

16
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:52,508
...in another student's,
you know, upper buttock fold.

17
00:01:53,837 --> 00:01:55,889
- Yes, yes.
- Gwen Ridley, Greendale Gazette.

18
00:01:56,047 --> 00:01:58,349
Is this the return
of the Ass Crack Bandit?

19
00:01:58,508 --> 00:02:01,059
Okay, that person, Gwen,
if he ever existed...

20
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:03,271
...stopped being active
over a year ago.

21
00:02:04,181 --> 00:02:05,936
- Yeah.
- Tim Briggs, Greendale Mirror.

22
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:07,772
Is it true that after the attack...

23
00:02:07,934 --> 00:02:09,737
...you received a letter
from the Ass Crack Bandit?

24
00:02:09,895 --> 00:02:13,027
I never said that. When did
we split The Gazette from The Mirror?

25
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,574
And how many photographs
do you people need?

26
00:02:15,734 --> 00:02:19,874
Raul Lopez, Las Noticias Hispanicas
de Greendale. Will this affect soccer?

27
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,458
We did, in fact, receive a letter
an hour after the incident...

28
00:02:23,617 --> 00:02:25,871
...including details
not known to the public...

29
00:02:26,036 --> 00:02:28,919
...about the brand
of Garrett's underwear.

30
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,255
Hanes His Ways.

31
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:32,548
"I am the Ass Crack Bandit.

32
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:34,512
Humans make better banks
than piggies.

33
00:02:34,669 --> 00:02:36,674
Whenever I get more change
at the store...

34
00:02:36,838 --> 00:02:38,890
...I can't wait to drop it
down your butts.

35
00:02:39,049 --> 00:02:41,896
I think I will go to the bank
and get so much change...

36
00:02:42,052 --> 00:02:44,104
...and make all my dollars
into change...

37
00:02:44,262 --> 00:02:45,769
...and drop it all down there."

38
00:02:45,931 --> 00:02:47,484
He should be called
"The Run-on Sentence Bandit."

39
00:02:47,641 --> 00:02:49,977
From this moment, people,
we are at DEFCON 4...

40
00:02:50,143 --> 00:02:53,690
If that's the highest DEFCON, and if
high DEFCONs are worse than low ones.

41
00:02:53,855 --> 00:02:56,323
You all remember
psychology Professor Duncan.

42
00:02:56,483 --> 00:02:59,330
- Hey, where'd you go?
- I was taking care of my sick mother.

43
00:02:59,486 --> 00:03:01,989
She's still alive,
but I've put in my time.

44
00:03:02,155 --> 00:03:04,623
Britta. Oh, Pierce, good for you.

45
00:03:04,783 --> 00:03:07,369
I always thought that hairpiece
was a bit cowardly.

46
00:03:07,536 --> 00:03:11,546
Duncan is going to help us
work up something called a profile...

47
00:03:11,706 --> 00:03:13,628
...so we can root this student out.

48
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,836
For the record...

49
00:03:15,001 --> 00:03:16,591
...I tried to get something done
about this two years ago.

50
00:03:16,753 --> 00:03:18,972
This is not about you.
It's about the school.

51
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,467
This is the biggest PR crisis
to hit Greendale...

52
00:03:21,633 --> 00:03:24,018
...since our rally
protesting the wrong Korea.

53
00:03:24,177 --> 00:03:26,017
Jeffrey, how can you help?

54
00:03:26,179 --> 00:03:28,350
I'll take a look
at the whole picture...

55
00:03:28,515 --> 00:03:30,022
...see if any pieces match up.

56
00:03:30,809 --> 00:03:32,695
Double fruit bonus.

57
00:03:33,436 --> 00:03:36,154
Crikey! Kiwi combo, mate.

58
00:03:36,314 --> 00:03:39,577
I took a map of the campus
and pinpointed all the locations...

59
00:03:39,734 --> 00:03:42,867
- ...of the Ass Crack Bandit strikes.
- You can't handle the fruit.

60
00:03:43,029 --> 00:03:45,663
During the Bandit's
most daring spree...

61
00:03:45,824 --> 00:03:47,876
...he cracked
three people in a row.

62
00:03:48,034 --> 00:03:50,917
Today, I sprinted
between all three sites.

63
00:03:51,121 --> 00:03:52,877
My quickest time
was 20 minutes.

64
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:55,341
The A.C.B. did it in 10.
So he's got long legs.

65
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,217
I think he has something
I don't, a shortcut.

66
00:03:58,378 --> 00:04:01,142
The faculty lounge.
You think the Bandit's a teacher?

67
00:04:01,298 --> 00:04:03,385
The dean's not gonna
help me pursue this.

68
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,602
- I need help.
- Pineapple penalty, fool!

69
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,346
No! Unfair and racist.

70
00:04:08,513 --> 00:04:10,067
Look, no way, Annie.

71
00:04:10,223 --> 00:04:12,525
Faculty hates me
and the dean signs my cheques.

72
00:04:12,684 --> 00:04:13,728
This is important!

73
00:04:13,894 --> 00:04:17,240
- I can assure you that's not true.
- Fruit, fruit, fruit!

74
00:04:17,397 --> 00:04:18,987
Yeah, collect the seeds, sucker!

75
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:21,201
After the tone,
please leave a message.

76
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:24,207
Hey, Abed. Lab ran late.

77
00:04:24,362 --> 00:04:27,577
What'd Annie get us for dinner?
I hope it's not salad again.

78
00:04:30,035 --> 00:04:31,921
I'd rather just stop at the meat store.

79
00:04:35,582 --> 00:04:37,587
All right. Talk to you later.

80
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,137
Well, hello.

81
00:04:56,937 --> 00:04:59,108
Will you stop
with the cups and the blankets?

82
00:04:59,314 --> 00:05:01,236
It's how
they comfort victims in movies.

83
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:04,033
Okay, I am hereby banning change
from this campus.

84
00:05:04,194 --> 00:05:08,037
- You really think that's an effective...
- Guess what, your two cents is change...

85
00:05:08,198 --> 00:05:09,918
- ...and it's banned.
- Got something.

86
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,717
Frankie,
somebody get me a bag.

87
00:05:16,873 --> 00:05:18,131
Oh, give me that.

88
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,673
"I hope you enjoyed my work again.

89
00:05:20,836 --> 00:05:24,050
You can't stop me, because
what are you gonna do, not have butts?"

90
00:05:24,214 --> 00:05:26,017
Dean, I think it's a teacher.

91
00:05:26,216 --> 00:05:28,387
- I beg your what?
- I have evidence showing...

92
00:05:28,552 --> 00:05:32,348
Yeah, and I have evidence that shows
I'm not listening. Exhibit A, exhibit B.

93
00:05:32,514 --> 00:05:35,729
This is never gonna end if you
keep choosing politics over justice.

94
00:05:35,892 --> 00:05:39,653
Okay, you wanna make trouble?
Go to Parker Brothers. You're out.

95
00:05:41,815 --> 00:05:43,487
Take it easy.

96
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:47,328
Taking it easy is how Troy ended up
with a quarter of a buck in his crack.

97
00:05:47,529 --> 00:05:50,115
- Annie, nobody's asking you to do th...
- Jeff, come on!

98
00:05:50,282 --> 00:05:53,746
You know how this school works.
We do it, or it doesn't get done.

99
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:55,666
The men on our coins
understood that.

100
00:05:55,871 --> 00:05:59,334
Maybe the Ass Crack Bandit's point
is we're letting our values slide.

101
00:05:59,499 --> 00:06:03,046
Or maybe he's a frat boy
coming from the Laundromat.

102
00:06:03,253 --> 00:06:05,970
The important question is
"who cares?"

103
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,724
Look...

104
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:16,020
Let me know what you need from me.
On the down low. Way down low.

105
00:06:16,725 --> 00:06:18,362
And no squealing.

106
00:06:20,061 --> 00:06:21,698
Okay, squeal.

107
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:30,323
Real Neil here, five days into the return
of the Ass Crack Bandit.

108
00:06:30,489 --> 00:06:33,253
- It's alive!
- Since we last spoke...

109
00:06:33,408 --> 00:06:35,709
...three more victims
have caught the quarter...

110
00:06:35,869 --> 00:06:37,340
...with no end in sight.

111
00:06:37,496 --> 00:06:40,379
- Safety pants, 100 bucks a pop.
- All sandwiches, $5.

112
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,213
Sorry, no change.
Blame the Bandit.

113
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:45,093
Here's a song that's been
shooting up the request line...

114
00:06:45,253 --> 00:06:46,974
...faster than coins are dropping.

115
00:07:00,393 --> 00:07:02,564
The nature of the Ass Crack
Bandit's crimes...

116
00:07:02,729 --> 00:07:05,944
...would suggest that
he's angry or just fell in love.

117
00:07:06,107 --> 00:07:08,160
We know that he hates money
or loves it...

118
00:07:08,318 --> 00:07:11,248
...or doesn't care about money
and hates butts or loves them.

119
00:07:11,404 --> 00:07:12,876
Abed, you're special.

120
00:07:13,031 --> 00:07:15,416
Can't you just stand
at the scene of the crime...

121
00:07:15,575 --> 00:07:18,339
- ...and see what happened?
- Yeah.

122
00:07:21,373 --> 00:07:23,923
I see a man...

123
00:07:24,084 --> 00:07:27,714
...using a social disorder
as a procedural device.

124
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:30,015
Wait, wait, wait,
I see another man.

125
00:07:30,173 --> 00:07:32,261
Mildly autistic
super detectives everywhere.

126
00:07:32,425 --> 00:07:35,937
Basic cable,
broadcast networks.

127
00:07:36,096 --> 00:07:39,939
Pain. Painful writing.

128
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,481
It hurts.

129
00:07:43,645 --> 00:07:45,733
Okay.
Hickey, what have you got?

130
00:07:45,897 --> 00:07:48,401
Heartburn. It doesn't help me
catch criminals.

131
00:07:48,567 --> 00:07:50,951
Okay. I didn't wanna
take drastic measures...

132
00:07:51,111 --> 00:07:54,457
...but I've cooked up a little something.
Chang?

133
00:07:56,449 --> 00:07:59,463
You better put a quarter
in that crack, Mr. Bandit.

134
00:07:59,619 --> 00:08:02,253
Professor Hickey.

135
00:08:11,131 --> 00:08:13,765
- Gotcha!
- What do you think?

136
00:08:13,925 --> 00:08:16,310
I think it's spending
too much money on a crime...

137
00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:19,851
- ...that nets you 25 cents a pop.
- No, no. This was free.

138
00:08:20,056 --> 00:08:23,022
Then I think you just admitted
you already owned a fake butt.

139
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:27,863
"I am the mad hatter,
if hats were butts.

140
00:08:28,857 --> 00:08:31,621
I am neither left nor right.
I am the space between.

141
00:08:31,776 --> 00:08:33,367
To me, you're all like ants...

142
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,492
...marching to class,
freaks on parade."

143
00:08:35,655 --> 00:08:38,455
I mean, why mix metaphors?
Ants don't have butts.

144
00:08:39,284 --> 00:08:42,132
- Wait a minute.
- Ants do have butts.

145
00:08:42,287 --> 00:08:44,173
No.
These are Dave lyrics.

146
00:08:44,331 --> 00:08:45,458
- Dave?
- Dave Matthews.

147
00:08:45,624 --> 00:08:47,463
Hard-core fans call him Dave.

148
00:08:47,626 --> 00:08:49,761
Oh, excuse me for being alive
in the '90s...

149
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,007
...and having two ears
connected to a heart.

150
00:08:52,172 --> 00:08:54,473
Okay, so all we need to do
is assemble a list...

151
00:08:54,633 --> 00:08:56,389
...of which Greendale teachers
are Dave Matthews fans.

152
00:08:56,551 --> 00:08:58,853
Guess we better get to work.

153
00:09:08,647 --> 00:09:12,574
- Done.
- Thought that would take longer.

154
00:09:12,734 --> 00:09:15,534
So please approve
the dean's new security measure...

155
00:09:15,695 --> 00:09:17,083
...called Troy's Law...

156
00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:19,825
...because a camera
in the bathroom...

157
00:09:22,035 --> 00:09:24,005
...is better than a quarter
in your butt.

158
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,882
As we've seen,
the Ass Crack Bandit...

159
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,840
...can be defeated
by using the three B's:

160
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:33,264
Belts, briefs, and buddies.
Good.

161
00:09:33,463 --> 00:09:37,343
The Bandit always gets
his victims when they're alone.

162
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:41,436
Bend over with friends over.
There's safety in numbers.

163
00:09:43,431 --> 00:09:45,022
I got cracked!

164
00:09:46,059 --> 00:09:48,064
He's under the bleachers!

165
00:09:48,228 --> 00:09:51,241
Everyone remain calm, please!
All right, free-for-all!

166
00:09:53,358 --> 00:09:55,695
- Hey. Where you been?
- I questioned Guterman.

167
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:56,904
We can cross him off.

168
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:00,249
The first cracking, he was chaperoning
Greendale's science dance.

169
00:10:00,407 --> 00:10:01,913
The student that attended
can vouch for him.

170
00:10:02,075 --> 00:10:03,416
I checked out Mrs. Plimpton.

171
00:10:03,577 --> 00:10:05,214
Airtight alibi. She's dead.

172
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,790
Next on my list is this one.

173
00:10:07,998 --> 00:10:11,212
Bublitz.
We're close, I can feel it.

174
00:10:12,669 --> 00:10:15,884
This extra long churro
tastes good in my real mouth.

175
00:10:23,138 --> 00:10:24,810
May I help you?

176
00:10:25,015 --> 00:10:28,112
We'd like to ask you
a few questions if that's okay.

177
00:10:28,268 --> 00:10:30,320
He's bolting!

178
00:10:36,109 --> 00:10:37,153
He's there!

179
00:10:44,284 --> 00:10:47,333
If you're going to confiscate this,
know one thing.

180
00:10:48,288 --> 00:10:52,381
It's a mild, kind sativa,
perfect for playing guitar.

181
00:10:53,293 --> 00:10:55,132
There's been another...

182
00:10:58,173 --> 00:11:00,260
What the hell?

183
00:11:00,425 --> 00:11:01,813
Destroying classrooms?

184
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:05,474
Secretly investigating teachers
behind my back?

185
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:09,352
Someone has to investigate faculty,
but you're like a single-celled organism:

186
00:11:09,518 --> 00:11:12,483
- No nerve.
- Annie, you're suspended.

187
00:11:12,646 --> 00:11:14,318
Wait, you can't do that!

188
00:11:14,481 --> 00:11:16,071
Don't tell me what I can't do.

189
00:11:16,233 --> 00:11:18,487
What do you think you are,
Cosmo's July quiz?

190
00:11:18,652 --> 00:11:19,993
She was trying to help you.

191
00:11:20,153 --> 00:11:21,874
Let me ask you two something.

192
00:11:22,072 --> 00:11:24,836
Let me be, like, the 50th person
at this school to ask:

193
00:11:24,991 --> 00:11:26,961
What is this, huh?

194
00:11:27,118 --> 00:11:29,539
- What is this creepy business?
- What?

195
00:11:29,704 --> 00:11:33,002
I think you two like
to partner up on cutesy capers...

196
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:35,302
...so you can hold hands
in the dark...

197
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:39,304
...and address your urges
in semi-acceptable scenarios.

198
00:11:39,464 --> 00:11:40,556
Whoa, not cool!

199
00:11:40,757 --> 00:11:43,177
You not cool! You unprofessional!

200
00:11:43,343 --> 00:11:45,680
I'm punishing you, Jeffrey.
Starting next week...

201
00:11:45,846 --> 00:11:48,479
...you are the new coach
of the water polo team.

202
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,732
- What?
- That's right.

203
00:11:49,891 --> 00:11:52,525
Every morning, in the water...

204
00:11:53,937 --> 00:11:56,737
Craig Pelton, dean
and assistant water polo coach.

205
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,526
- What?
- This is the Ass Crack Bandit.

206
00:12:00,569 --> 00:12:03,072
I find it funny you ever thought
you could catch me.

207
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,700
Oh, that's very interesting.
Please continue.

208
00:12:05,866 --> 00:12:08,286
I've enjoyed our game.
It's funny how close...

209
00:12:08,451 --> 00:12:10,753
...your two little helpers
came to catching me.

210
00:12:10,912 --> 00:12:13,463
I liked watching them run in circles.
But I wonder...

211
00:12:13,623 --> 00:12:16,553
...are they chasing me as an excuse
to get near each other?

212
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:20,008
- I mean, get a room already.
- We're friends!

213
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:22,307
Why don't you tell us where
you are, and we'll discuss it?

214
00:12:22,465 --> 00:12:25,051
I am the bringer of change.
I am the filler of cracks.

215
00:12:25,218 --> 00:12:28,896
Oh, that's very interesting.
I myself was in 4H.

216
00:12:30,891 --> 00:12:32,444
Trace the call, Rhonda!

217
00:12:32,642 --> 00:12:34,564
This means trace the call!

218
00:12:34,728 --> 00:12:36,234
Look at the extension.

219
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,033
Five-nine-four. Okay.

220
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:40,744
Tracing...

221
00:12:40,942 --> 00:12:42,912
Tracing...

222
00:12:43,069 --> 00:12:45,288
Got it, the stables!
We have stables?

223
00:12:45,447 --> 00:12:46,740
Let's go.

224
00:12:52,954 --> 00:12:55,125
- Creepy.
- I don't know.

225
00:12:55,373 --> 00:12:57,046
Add some doilies
and a foot bath...

226
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:58,929
...and this is my mom's house.

227
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:12,100
Mush! mush!

228
00:13:12,265 --> 00:13:14,650
Mush! Mush!

229
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:17,395
- No, run. Mush!
- Star-Burns?

230
00:13:20,398 --> 00:13:22,984
Since faking his death
to escape meth charges...

231
00:13:23,193 --> 00:13:26,871
...Alex "Star-Burns" Osbourne
has been living in the stables...

232
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:30,127
...eating garbage,
and trying to build a cat car.

233
00:13:30,325 --> 00:13:32,460
He's also confessed
to dropping coins...

234
00:13:32,619 --> 00:13:35,965
...down exposed butt cracks.
Case closed.

235
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:39,924
- High five?
- Sure.

236
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:42,802
- No.
- Oh, American high five. Sorry.

237
00:13:45,048 --> 00:13:46,471
Oh, my God.

238
00:14:03,859 --> 00:14:05,994
So much pain.

239
00:14:06,153 --> 00:14:07,493
But now it's time to heal!

240
00:14:07,654 --> 00:14:09,457
You're all invited
to the official...

241
00:14:09,614 --> 00:14:12,165
..."We Caught the Ass Crack
Bandit" Dance tonight...

242
00:14:12,325 --> 00:14:13,618
...in the cafeteria!

243
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:20,293
Jeff!

244
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,012
There's no way
Star-Burns did it.

245
00:14:22,169 --> 00:14:23,806
Innocent people don't confess.

246
00:14:23,962 --> 00:14:27,177
Are you kidding me? You knew
it was a teacher. It doesn't add up.

247
00:14:27,382 --> 00:14:28,853
Maybe I was wrong.

248
00:14:29,009 --> 00:14:32,022
Or maybe the dean was right
about us.

249
00:14:32,179 --> 00:14:33,685
What? No. Annie...

250
00:14:33,847 --> 00:14:36,730
...I took this case because
I wanted to help you.

251
00:14:36,892 --> 00:14:38,185
Then what is this?

252
00:14:38,351 --> 00:14:40,403
It's platonic shoulder holding.

253
00:14:40,562 --> 00:14:42,365
Look.

254
00:14:42,522 --> 00:14:44,741
Leonard, hello, how are you?

255
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:50,746
It's a guy who puts quarters
down butt cracks, Jeff.

256
00:14:50,906 --> 00:14:52,993
Let's just let it go.

257
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:01,713
We can do better.

258
00:15:05,212 --> 00:15:06,552
All right. Change is money!

259
00:15:08,715 --> 00:15:10,767
What are you guys, millionaires?

260
00:15:10,967 --> 00:15:13,055
T-shirts here!
Cracked but not broken, huh?

261
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,691
Who's in? T-shirts!

262
00:15:14,846 --> 00:15:17,314
T-shirts here! Twenty bucks.

263
00:15:20,852 --> 00:15:22,608
- Professor Duncan?
- Yeah?

264
00:15:22,813 --> 00:15:24,699
- Not going to the dance?
- I'll go later.

265
00:15:24,856 --> 00:15:27,905
Actually, would you mind coming
to get me when Britta's drunk?

266
00:15:28,109 --> 00:15:31,158
Listen, as Britta's friend,
I should give you this ad...

267
00:15:31,988 --> 00:15:35,417
Yes! That is my jam right there.

268
00:15:36,451 --> 00:15:39,630
- Dave Matthews fan?
- Obviously you're not.

269
00:15:39,788 --> 00:15:42,635
Real fans call him Dave.

270
00:15:44,584 --> 00:15:46,921
I've heard this song before.
Winger, who is this?

271
00:15:47,128 --> 00:15:49,098
What are you talking about?
Don't know?

272
00:15:49,256 --> 00:15:50,928
I remember it from the '90s.

273
00:15:53,718 --> 00:15:55,770
- It's Dave.
- Lee Roth?

274
00:15:55,971 --> 00:15:58,735
- You're not the Ass Crack Bandit.
- Keep it down, huh?

275
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,278
I made a deal with the dean.

276
00:16:00,433 --> 00:16:03,363
Said as long as I confessed,
he'd let me slide on the meth...

277
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,490
...and buy a space heater for my stable.

278
00:16:05,647 --> 00:16:08,779
- But why call the dean and pretend that...
- I didn't call no dean.

279
00:16:08,942 --> 00:16:11,196
I don't call nobody don't call me.

280
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:14,990
I got to go backstage once
and meet the whole band.

281
00:16:15,157 --> 00:16:17,327
Everyone except Dave.

282
00:16:17,534 --> 00:16:20,417
There's a whole album
of photos online if you go to...

283
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:22,631
You actually wouldn't be able
to access it.

284
00:16:22,789 --> 00:16:26,336
I use an older, British form
of Facebook called Mug-scroll.

285
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:35,430
- I guess I should be going.
- No, no, stay.

286
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:37,396
We're just getting to know
each other.

287
00:16:37,554 --> 00:16:39,144
I really shouldn't, I have a...

288
00:16:40,974 --> 00:16:43,026
Aren't you
going to pick those up?

289
00:16:44,561 --> 00:16:45,688
Yes.

290
00:16:49,816 --> 00:16:54,206
Just reach down
with your hand and...

291
00:17:00,243 --> 00:17:01,797
Bye.

292
00:17:07,501 --> 00:17:08,972
This is the Ass Crack Bandit.

293
00:17:09,169 --> 00:17:12,052
I find it funny that you ever
thought you could catch me.

294
00:17:12,214 --> 00:17:13,305
Jeff.

295
00:17:14,174 --> 00:17:16,511
It's Duncan.

296
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,275
Annie?

297
00:17:25,977 --> 00:17:27,365
Jeff?

298
00:17:27,521 --> 00:17:30,071
Very nice.

299
00:17:30,232 --> 00:17:31,655
Oh, bloody hell...

300
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:35,031
...my shoe is untied
by British standards.

301
00:17:35,904 --> 00:17:36,948
Here we go.

302
00:17:37,113 --> 00:17:39,368
One bunny, two bunnies.

303
00:17:39,533 --> 00:17:41,253
Get Britta!

304
00:17:41,409 --> 00:17:44,458
Annie! Did Duncan get cracked?

305
00:17:44,621 --> 00:17:47,089
Where's the Bandit?
Do you see him?

306
00:17:47,249 --> 00:17:49,835
- Over there!
- Come on, let's get him!

307
00:17:52,546 --> 00:17:55,049
- Shirley, what are you doing?
- Looking for you.

308
00:17:55,215 --> 00:17:57,267
Did you see someone
come this way?

309
00:17:57,467 --> 00:18:00,849
Jeff, Annie, Pierce is dead.

310
00:18:08,478 --> 00:18:11,741
Tonight's celebration was
cut short by some tragic news.

311
00:18:11,898 --> 00:18:14,402
Pierce Hawthorne,
14-year Greendale student...

312
00:18:14,568 --> 00:18:17,201
...entrepreneur,
and expert heart attack faker...

313
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:19,450
...has passed away,
for real this time.

314
00:18:19,614 --> 00:18:23,043
Pierce had been recently banned
from campus but not from our hearts.

315
00:18:23,201 --> 00:18:25,123
He's survived by many ex-wives...

316
00:18:25,287 --> 00:18:28,419
...and all of us here at Greendale
that called him friend.

317
00:18:28,582 --> 00:18:32,425
If you're listening, Pierce,
you were a hell of a D&D player.

318
00:18:32,586 --> 00:18:33,879
It's time to level up.

319
00:18:34,045 --> 00:18:35,932
Up next on the dial
is Dr. Farts.

320
00:18:41,761 --> 00:18:43,601
I can't believe Pierce is gone.

321
00:18:43,763 --> 00:18:48,105
Yeah. Life is weird.

322
00:18:48,268 --> 00:18:51,447
It's a container
for all this little stuff...

323
00:18:51,605 --> 00:18:53,242
...and you get caught up in it.

324
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:57,111
And then,
the container just:

325
00:18:59,112 --> 00:19:01,580
That hallway
led to a dead end.

326
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,753
We might've had him.

327
00:19:05,327 --> 00:19:08,625
I should get home. Haven't slept.

328
00:19:15,086 --> 00:19:18,016
The case goes cold again.

329
00:19:21,134 --> 00:19:23,471
Don't worry.
I got a feeling he'll be back.

330
00:19:23,637 --> 00:19:26,140
Or her.

331
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:45,052
You know, climate change
is threatening our world...

332
00:20:45,218 --> 00:20:46,725
...but there is a solution:

333
00:20:46,887 --> 00:20:48,358
The cat car.

334
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:51,017
The world's first
animal-powered vehicle.

335
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:53,686
My original prototype
was hunger-based.

336
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:56,272
But sometimes, cats aren't hungry.

337
00:20:56,438 --> 00:20:59,784
My new model will use
a rear-fixed dog system.

338
00:20:59,941 --> 00:21:01,911
But dogs cost money,
your money.

339
00:21:02,068 --> 00:21:04,916
By donating to this project,
you'll be like an investor...

340
00:21:05,071 --> 00:21:07,408
...except without taking
all my profits.

341
00:21:07,574 --> 00:21:10,208
Donate $5,
and you get a thank-you e-mail.

342
00:21:10,368 --> 00:21:12,089
Fifty dollars gets you a T-shirt.

343
00:21:12,245 --> 00:21:15,923
One hundred gets you a T-shirt
and a thank-you e-mail.

344
00:21:16,082 --> 00:21:17,589
All aboard the cat car...

345
00:21:17,751 --> 00:21:21,594
...and all aboard helping
our nation's global warming.
