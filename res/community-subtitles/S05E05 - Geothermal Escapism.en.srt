1
00:00:01,632 --> 00:00:05,144
This is from all of us, Troy.
When you're sailing around the world...

2
00:00:05,303 --> 00:00:07,557
...you'll be going through
a lot of countries.

3
00:00:07,722 --> 00:00:09,809
So we got you a universal translator.

4
00:00:11,726 --> 00:00:13,482
Cool.

5
00:00:14,145 --> 00:00:15,438
Cool.

6
00:00:15,605 --> 00:00:16,648
Thanks, guys.

7
00:00:16,814 --> 00:00:19,318
I didn't know going-away parties
could be so much fun.

8
00:00:19,484 --> 00:00:22,995
- I should leave all the time.
- Let's not forget it's okay to be sad too.

9
00:00:23,154 --> 00:00:25,491
Britta, do you get kickbacks
from Big Buzz Kill?

10
00:00:25,656 --> 00:00:26,949
- I'm serious.
- We know.

11
00:00:27,116 --> 00:00:30,165
The truth is a member of our family
is leaving.

12
00:00:30,328 --> 00:00:31,669
For a year, maybe more.

13
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:34,795
Psychology has taught me
the human mind has a tendency...

14
00:00:34,957 --> 00:00:36,927
...to rechannel separation anxiety...

15
00:00:37,084 --> 00:00:40,383
...in the form of frivolity
and giddiness, and...

16
00:00:40,546 --> 00:00:43,844
I don't want us to waste our chance
to acknowledge...

17
00:00:44,008 --> 00:00:46,060
...how much we're gonna miss you.

18
00:00:47,845 --> 00:00:49,850
- Attention, Greendale.
- Oh, announcements.

19
00:00:50,014 --> 00:00:52,019
- Announcements.
- Oh, I love these.

20
00:00:52,183 --> 00:00:54,769
- Announcements.
- I'm standing here with Abed Nadir...

21
00:00:54,936 --> 00:00:58,198
...who has chosen
to give his best friend, Troy...

22
00:00:58,356 --> 00:01:00,942
...the very special
going-away present...

23
00:01:01,108 --> 00:01:05,997
...of declaring a school-wide game
of Hot Lava.

24
00:01:06,155 --> 00:01:07,958
- Cool.
- Oh, that sounds like fun.

25
00:01:08,115 --> 00:01:10,749
- No. Process your feelings.
- Hot Lava is the sweet...

26
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:12,251
...classic children's game...

27
00:01:12,411 --> 00:01:17,216
...in which you are not allowed
to touch the fioor or you're dead.

28
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:22,345
I think it's cute. And while I normally
don't condone climbing on furniture...

29
00:01:22,505 --> 00:01:25,353
...Troy and Abed's friendship
has been such a special...

30
00:01:25,508 --> 00:01:28,557
...and magical part of Greendale,
we owe it to ourselves...

31
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:30,143
...to honour it.

32
00:01:30,304 --> 00:01:31,692
Abed, anything to add?

33
00:01:31,848 --> 00:01:35,110
Yes, take this seriously.
Stay on furniture. No books, no bags.

34
00:01:35,268 --> 00:01:37,569
Dead can't talk.
No coming back as a lava monster.

35
00:01:38,062 --> 00:01:40,743
- Yes. Hot Lava.
- Come on, guys...

36
00:01:40,898 --> 00:01:43,449
...this is classic avoidance.
I have to go talk to him.

37
00:01:43,609 --> 00:01:46,872
Because the non-awesome often need
incentive to do awesome stuff...

38
00:01:47,029 --> 00:01:50,327
...the survivor will win my near-mint
condition issue of Space Clone...

39
00:01:50,491 --> 00:01:54,085
...valued by the Comics Authority
at $50,000.

40
00:01:54,245 --> 00:01:55,372
Wh...? I'm sorry?

41
00:01:55,538 --> 00:01:57,294
The floor turns to lava in 10...

42
00:01:57,456 --> 00:02:00,090
...nine, eight, seven...

43
00:02:00,251 --> 00:02:01,971
Did you say 15 or 50,000?

44
00:02:02,128 --> 00:02:03,599
- ...six...
- Oh, who am I kidding?

45
00:02:03,754 --> 00:02:04,798
Help, lava.

46
00:02:04,964 --> 00:02:10,267
...five, four, three, two...

47
00:02:11,762 --> 00:02:14,389

49
00:02:24,484 --> 00:02:26,156
Professor Duncan?

50
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,493
You stay back, Britta.

51
00:02:27,653 --> 00:02:30,453
I'm not afraid to push a girl
into make-believe lava.

52
00:02:30,615 --> 00:02:33,414
- It's been my primary strategy.
- I'm staying in the game...

53
00:02:33,576 --> 00:02:35,379
...so I can talk to Abed. I'm worried.

54
00:02:35,536 --> 00:02:37,008
What I'm worried about is money.

55
00:02:37,163 --> 00:02:39,880
My self-published novels
aren't going to publish themselves.

56
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:42,805
Don't regress to primal behaviour
just because it's allowed.

57
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,380
We're human beings,
not the editors of Teen Vogue.

58
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,350
A terrible example
for today's young women.

59
00:02:48,508 --> 00:02:51,521
Well, I'm sorry, Britta,
but it's either you or me.

60
00:02:51,677 --> 00:02:53,314
And I'm me.

61
00:02:53,471 --> 00:02:55,143
- No.
- Yes, yes, yes.

62
00:03:01,062 --> 00:03:02,106
Real nice, Winger.

63
00:03:02,271 --> 00:03:04,822
This is why the English
never win any sports.

64
00:03:04,982 --> 00:03:08,115
Because everyone else cheats.

65
00:03:08,277 --> 00:03:10,329
Britta, there you are.

66
00:03:10,488 --> 00:03:13,205
Sweet, sweet, portable chairs.

67
00:03:13,366 --> 00:03:14,493
Plastic gold.

68
00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:16,296
Four-legged diamonds.

69
00:03:16,452 --> 00:03:17,579
You claiming this?

70
00:03:17,745 --> 00:03:19,003
Lava joust?

71
00:03:19,539 --> 00:03:21,508
You hit your heads
on each other's heads?

72
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:23,920
Get real.
Once the last of the chairs are gone...

73
00:03:24,085 --> 00:03:26,304
...a sofa hopper like you
won't last 20 minutes.

74
00:03:26,462 --> 00:03:29,013
You wanna join this alliance
or you wanna join the lava?

75
00:03:29,173 --> 00:03:32,187
Fine. But I'm not learning
the new names for anything.

76
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,858
Centipeding isn't the fastest form
of travel...

77
00:03:36,013 --> 00:03:38,731
...but if we find more chairs,
we can do the Inchworm...

78
00:03:38,891 --> 00:03:40,102
...Scootenanny...

79
00:03:40,268 --> 00:03:41,359
...Reverse Danny Thomas.

80
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,654
Think this game's gotten
a little out of hand?

81
00:03:43,813 --> 00:03:47,028
Feels normal enough for a school
that's on 911's blocked caller list.

82
00:03:47,191 --> 00:03:49,196
I like that Abed wanted
to send Troy off.

83
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,199
Send him off or put off sending him?

84
00:03:51,362 --> 00:03:54,993
I think this imaginary lava
might symbolise Abed's fear of change.

85
00:03:55,158 --> 00:03:57,708
That diagnosis symbolizes
your lack of a psych degree.

86
00:03:57,869 --> 00:03:59,292
Mama mahogany.

87
00:03:59,453 --> 00:04:03,380
- Feast your feet on that stack of sticks.
- Too easy. Could be a trap.

88
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:06,341
As if someone else is taking this game
as seriously as you.

89
00:04:06,502 --> 00:04:09,136
Let's keep this centipede rolling.
Give me a chair.

90
00:04:09,297 --> 00:04:10,554
So stupid.

91
00:04:10,715 --> 00:04:12,221
Come on.

92
00:04:14,469 --> 00:04:17,054
- Locker, locker, locker.
- Locker Boys.

93
00:04:18,764 --> 00:04:20,437
- Locker.
- Locker, locker, locker.

94
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,399
Winger, Edison and Perry.

95
00:04:23,561 --> 00:04:25,447
What a delicious combination.

96
00:04:25,605 --> 00:04:27,195
Locker, locker, locker.

97
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:30,912
What are we getting from this
extra level of commitment?

98
00:04:31,068 --> 00:04:32,705
We're getting your chairs, food...

99
00:04:32,862 --> 00:04:35,247
...and the names
of your same-sex celebrity crushes.

100
00:04:35,406 --> 00:04:39,167
Everyone has one, don't lie.
Then you're free to go, into lava.

101
00:04:39,327 --> 00:04:40,917
Locker, locker, locker.

102
00:04:48,628 --> 00:04:51,262
Stand down or meet your doom,
Chang.

103
00:04:51,422 --> 00:04:55,183
You're in no position to make threats.
Our truce ended when you banished us...

104
00:04:55,343 --> 00:04:58,440
- ...from the pay phone bench.
- You used that to upset the balance.

105
00:04:58,596 --> 00:05:01,360
By the vapours of Magmarath,
we will restore it.

106
00:05:01,516 --> 00:05:04,101
- You have gods?
- Locker boys.

107
00:05:04,268 --> 00:05:06,772
- Earn your M&M's.
- Locker.

108
00:05:06,938 --> 00:05:09,785
Troy and Abed intimidation stance.

109
00:05:14,278 --> 00:05:17,126
I guess that actually looked
the way it did in my head.

110
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,429
Hi, kids.

111
00:05:28,584 --> 00:05:31,799
I'm criminology professor
Buzz Hickey...

112
00:05:31,963 --> 00:05:35,427
...and this, this is just a little
something I threw together.

113
00:05:44,475 --> 00:05:45,567
Jump.

114
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:52,151
- Centipede, centipede.
- Okay.

115
00:05:54,152 --> 00:05:56,620
Pull harder. Pull harder.

116
00:05:56,779 --> 00:05:58,369
Pull harder.

117
00:05:58,531 --> 00:06:00,999
My same-sex celebrity crush
is Nathan Fillion.

118
00:06:02,326 --> 00:06:03,833
Nathan Fillion.

119
00:06:04,495 --> 00:06:07,176
Jeff, Annie. Get to Shirley Island.
We'll meet you there.

120
00:06:07,331 --> 00:06:08,922
Abed, save yourself.

121
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:12,346
Abed, before Troy dies in lava...

122
00:06:12,503 --> 00:06:14,674
...you can save yourself emotionally...

123
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:19,181
...by honestly experiencing the pain
of him leaving Greendale.

124
00:06:19,343 --> 00:06:22,309
We can do this in three steps.
Britta, jump to that trash can.

125
00:06:22,472 --> 00:06:23,764
Troy, start inchworming.

126
00:06:23,931 --> 00:06:26,316
- Third step?
- Third step's survival. Good luck.

127
00:06:26,476 --> 00:06:28,611
Seriously? Troy.

128
00:06:28,769 --> 00:06:30,360
Sorry, Britta, Abed knows best.

129
00:06:30,521 --> 00:06:33,535
I'll remember you as slowing us down
and complaining a lot.

130
00:06:33,691 --> 00:06:34,865
Oh, my... No!

131
00:06:42,533 --> 00:06:43,826
They abandoned you?

132
00:06:43,993 --> 00:06:46,461
This game's doing bad things
to people.

133
00:06:46,621 --> 00:06:49,338
I'm just in it for the money.
My son's getting gay married.

134
00:06:49,499 --> 00:06:52,002
The flowers alone, you have no idea.

135
00:06:52,835 --> 00:06:54,259
I get it.

136
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,057
I lived in New York.

137
00:06:58,925 --> 00:07:00,894
All right, Miss Perry, climb aboard.

138
00:07:01,052 --> 00:07:02,179
It's fake killing time.

139
00:07:17,902 --> 00:07:19,741
Welcome to Shirley Island.

140
00:07:20,863 --> 00:07:22,417
No furniture beyond this point.

141
00:07:22,573 --> 00:07:25,373
Leave weapons at the door
and spare doors at the entrance.

142
00:07:28,579 --> 00:07:30,916
Then came the now-now times...

143
00:07:31,082 --> 00:07:35,887
...when the floors were covered
with the burny touch.

144
00:07:39,423 --> 00:07:41,263
- You made it.
- Friends.

145
00:07:41,425 --> 00:07:44,474
Welcome to Shirley Island,
where all your dreams come true...

146
00:07:44,637 --> 00:07:48,398
...if you dream of standing on a table
and pissing in a jar. Where's Britta?

147
00:07:48,558 --> 00:07:51,441
- She didn't make it.
- Oh, that's too bad.

148
00:07:52,937 --> 00:07:54,278
- Poor Britta.
- It's okay.

149
00:07:54,438 --> 00:07:56,907
Her sacrifice got us this far,
and now we can't lose.

150
00:07:57,066 --> 00:07:58,110
Why not?

151
00:07:58,276 --> 00:08:02,368
Because now we're on Shirley Island,
and according to legend, so is The Orb.

152
00:08:03,114 --> 00:08:05,534
I'm sure I have no idea
what you're speaking of.

153
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,286
- This is a place of peace.
- And profit.

154
00:08:08,452 --> 00:08:10,458
- Come again?
- You're not really playing.

155
00:08:10,621 --> 00:08:12,673
You're a merchant,
and more power to you.

156
00:08:12,832 --> 00:08:15,418
But don't withhold power
from others just to make money.

157
00:08:16,377 --> 00:08:18,631
- We want The Orb.
- Abed.

158
00:08:20,298 --> 00:08:23,062
I'm still raw from what happened
with Britta back there.

159
00:08:23,217 --> 00:08:25,803
I mean, fun is fun,
but I don't want my last day here...

160
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:28,307
...to be a day
where everyone hates me.

161
00:08:29,182 --> 00:08:30,309
Last day?

162
00:08:30,475 --> 00:08:32,978
Citizens of Shirley Island.

163
00:08:34,228 --> 00:08:35,865
What have you brought to my door?

164
00:08:36,022 --> 00:08:37,778
Stay back.

165
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,487
My God, it's Hickey.

166
00:08:41,652 --> 00:08:43,539
And he's got Chair Walkers.

167
00:08:47,283 --> 00:08:49,751
Come out with your feet on the floor...

168
00:08:49,911 --> 00:08:54,336
...and there will be no need
for nudging or jostling.

169
00:08:54,499 --> 00:08:57,179
I did not skip my son's birthday
for second place.

170
00:09:04,091 --> 00:09:06,677
I wanna say something to you guys
about mental health.

171
00:09:06,844 --> 00:09:08,434
Is that Britta? Is she alive?

172
00:09:08,596 --> 00:09:11,609
- Why did you think she was dead?
- We kind of left her.

173
00:09:11,766 --> 00:09:13,688
Left her for dead?

174
00:09:13,851 --> 00:09:16,022
Sounds bad when you put it that way.

175
00:09:16,187 --> 00:09:19,568
You do realise this isn't just
a pile of chairs, right?

176
00:09:19,732 --> 00:09:23,955
This is a crib, and you're curled up
inside there, sucking your thumb...

177
00:09:24,111 --> 00:09:26,282
...because you're too scared
to say goodbye.

178
00:09:26,447 --> 00:09:28,499
Well, it's time to grow up.

179
00:09:28,658 --> 00:09:31,541
The adults are here,
and we're gonna tear down your fort.

180
00:09:31,702 --> 00:09:34,550
Chair Walkers, attack.

181
00:09:48,636 --> 00:09:50,522
My name was Vicki. Tell my story.

182
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,016
These are my only pants.
I can't get them dirty.

183
00:09:53,182 --> 00:09:54,523
I'm actually British.

184
00:09:54,684 --> 00:09:56,736
- Leonard. Butter them up.
- You got it.

185
00:10:08,906 --> 00:10:12,252
Cirque du So Long,
you high-stepping acro-bastards.

186
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,545
- Have any rolling chairs?
- Behind the curtain.

187
00:10:14,704 --> 00:10:15,747
Abandon fort.

188
00:10:15,913 --> 00:10:18,333
Women and man-children first.

189
00:10:18,499 --> 00:10:20,551
Hey, seat feet.

190
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,929
Chair to dance?

191
00:10:31,387 --> 00:10:32,894
Yes.

192
00:10:35,766 --> 00:10:37,107
Britta, I'm your friend.

193
00:10:37,268 --> 00:10:38,988
I can't hear dead people, Annie.

194
00:10:39,145 --> 00:10:43,617
- I'm in a world of imagination.
- Then imagine what the floor looks like.

195
00:10:43,774 --> 00:10:46,954
I don't have to. I'll just
imagine where you're about to be.

196
00:10:47,111 --> 00:10:50,705
- The same as imagining the floor.
- You just admitted that's where you'll be.

197
00:10:50,865 --> 00:10:53,036
- Knock, knock.
- Not gonna say, "Who's there?"

198
00:10:53,201 --> 00:10:56,297
- Someone on the floor is knocking.
- You have to say, "Who's there?"

199
00:10:56,454 --> 00:10:57,747
- Floor.
- What?

200
00:10:57,914 --> 00:11:00,382
- That's who's there.
- Yeah. But it's for you.

201
00:11:06,297 --> 00:11:08,302
Give us The Orb.
We can save Shirley Island.

202
00:11:08,466 --> 00:11:12,476
The Orb can't save Shirley Island
because Shirley Island is The Orb.

203
00:11:12,637 --> 00:11:16,398
In a cool way like Keyser Soze
or a lame way like Jewel of the Nile?

204
00:11:18,434 --> 00:11:21,151
You tell Buzz Hickey
that Shirley Bennett said...

205
00:11:21,729 --> 00:11:24,659
Don't wanna waste time. Think of
something cool, give me credit.

206
00:11:24,816 --> 00:11:26,821
But the door I'm knocking on
is your home...

207
00:11:26,984 --> 00:11:31,160
- ...if I'm the floor, it means you're dead.
- If you're the floor, you're already dead.

208
00:11:31,322 --> 00:11:33,292
Just do it right. Knock, knock.

209
00:11:33,449 --> 00:11:34,623
Knock, knock.

210
00:11:41,624 --> 00:11:42,835
Who's there, bitch?

211
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,044
Floor.

212
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:46,630
Floor!

213
00:11:53,469 --> 00:11:56,518
- Troy and Abed in a bubble
- Troy and Abed in a bubble

214
00:12:22,373 --> 00:12:23,714
Hickey, you chicken.

215
00:12:29,505 --> 00:12:31,142
He gutted us. Retreat.

216
00:12:35,011 --> 00:12:36,731
Hello?

217
00:12:37,054 --> 00:12:38,857
Hello?

218
00:12:39,015 --> 00:12:40,568
I'm the only one left.

219
00:12:40,725 --> 00:12:44,237
I won 50,000 bucks.

220
00:12:44,395 --> 00:12:47,693
That's 50,000 lottery tickets.

221
00:12:54,155 --> 00:12:56,409
You can't outrun your emotions.

222
00:13:04,165 --> 00:13:06,929
I had a dream like this,
but it was sexual.

223
00:13:07,084 --> 00:13:10,928
I will force you two
to grieve properly even if it kills us all.

224
00:13:11,088 --> 00:13:12,844
Go away, Britta.

225
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,441
Sorry about our butts touching.

226
00:13:35,112 --> 00:13:37,283
Go into the vents.
They'll never find us there.

227
00:13:37,448 --> 00:13:38,706
I say we take a stand here.

228
00:13:38,866 --> 00:13:41,999
- Someone's gotta win sometime.
- Not if we never kill each other.

229
00:13:42,161 --> 00:13:44,297
- Then we can play forever.
- Right. Wait.

230
00:13:44,455 --> 00:13:47,385
Abed, the floor can't be lava forever.
The game's gotta end.

231
00:13:51,504 --> 00:13:54,802
It's not a game for me. I'm seeing
real lava because you're leaving.

232
00:13:54,966 --> 00:13:58,347
It's embarrassing, and I don't
wanna be crazy, but I am crazy, so...

233
00:13:58,761 --> 00:14:01,893
I made a game that made you
and everyone else see what I see.

234
00:14:06,561 --> 00:14:09,325
I don't want it to be there.
I want you to be able to leave.

235
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,066
I don't think the lava goes away
until you stop leaving.

236
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:13,905
So the only way I can help you...

237
00:14:14,068 --> 00:14:17,450
...is by giving up my chance
to be one person?

238
00:14:22,326 --> 00:14:23,999
You guys ready for closure?

239
00:14:24,162 --> 00:14:25,419
Of your caskets?

240
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,671
Guys, stop, okay?

241
00:14:26,831 --> 00:14:28,005
The lava's real to Abed.

242
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,756
- It's not a game to him.
- Oh, no.

243
00:14:29,917 --> 00:14:32,847
You know what I think?
I think he's used to getting his own way.

244
00:14:33,004 --> 00:14:35,009
I think he's never met me.

245
00:14:41,637 --> 00:14:44,022
Abed. Abed.

246
00:14:48,227 --> 00:14:49,354
Unbelievable.

247
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,866
When this game is over,
I'm gonna shove you back.

248
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,535
Abed, give me your other hand.

249
00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:00,866
It's down to us.
You or Britta will be the winner.

250
00:15:01,282 --> 00:15:03,287
I'm not leaving, okay? Just... I promise.

251
00:15:03,451 --> 00:15:05,622
The floor's not lava.
Just give me your hand.

252
00:15:05,786 --> 00:15:08,420
I don't think the lava's here
because you're leaving.

253
00:15:08,581 --> 00:15:11,630
I think it's here because I won't let go.
Sorry.

254
00:15:12,126 --> 00:15:13,467
- Bye.
- Abed.

255
00:15:13,628 --> 00:15:15,549
Abed. Abed.

256
00:15:15,713 --> 00:15:17,552
Abed!

257
00:15:18,382 --> 00:15:20,553
Abed! Abed!

258
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:27,562
Abed.

259
00:15:27,725 --> 00:15:29,232
He's fake dead.

260
00:15:30,061 --> 00:15:31,733
Forever.

261
00:15:33,731 --> 00:15:35,404
Shut up.

262
00:15:35,566 --> 00:15:38,070
What? Stop.

263
00:15:42,365 --> 00:15:43,408
He's not really dead.

264
00:15:43,574 --> 00:15:46,042
But he's really playing dead,
and he's not gonna stop.

265
00:15:46,202 --> 00:15:47,246
Here.

266
00:15:47,411 --> 00:15:49,167
Congratulations, you win.

267
00:15:50,081 --> 00:15:51,255
You don't get it.

268
00:15:51,707 --> 00:15:53,298
No one gets Abed.

269
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:54,752
I got him a little.

270
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:57,006
This is my fault.

271
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:02,186
I don't deserve to fake live.

272
00:16:02,343 --> 00:16:03,517
Wait. No.

273
00:16:03,678 --> 00:16:05,019
- I can fix him.
- How?

274
00:16:05,179 --> 00:16:08,892
I don't know. In real life, I don't know,
but I can fake fix him.

275
00:16:09,058 --> 00:16:10,102
SPACE
CLONE

276
00:16:10,268 --> 00:16:12,355
- I can clone him. I'll clone him.
- Go on.

277
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,284
I just need his DNA.

278
00:16:15,439 --> 00:16:17,694
Let's get his DNA.
Don't touch the lava.

279
00:16:17,859 --> 00:16:19,365
You might be onto something.

280
00:16:19,527 --> 00:16:23,039
I'm gonna find discarded technology
from this once great civilisation...

281
00:16:23,197 --> 00:16:25,285
...and start a cloning machine.

282
00:16:25,449 --> 00:16:28,796
Okay, I'm placing
this cellular regeneration sequencer...

283
00:16:28,953 --> 00:16:30,376
...on the spot where he died.

284
00:16:30,538 --> 00:16:33,753
- Here, don't forget this.
- This is a laser guidance system...

285
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:37,879
...that keeps the regeneration sequence
from jib-jabbing.

286
00:16:38,045 --> 00:16:39,303
Jib-jabbing?

287
00:16:39,464 --> 00:16:42,311
Initiate regeneration sequence.

288
00:16:57,607 --> 00:17:00,157
- It worked.
- We made a perfect clone of Abed.

289
00:17:06,282 --> 00:17:09,295
Actually, Britta's work was sloppy.
I'm not an exact replication.

290
00:17:09,452 --> 00:17:13,295
I have Abed's abilities and memories,
but I'm missing his wild emotionality.

291
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:18,962
Although I think I may be able
to let Troy go now.

292
00:17:21,172 --> 00:17:22,892
I don't know.

293
00:17:23,174 --> 00:17:25,475
I haven't been completely honest.

294
00:17:25,635 --> 00:17:27,307
I'm really scared to go on my trip.

295
00:17:28,137 --> 00:17:29,525
Well, you don't have to go.

296
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,187
Your clone can.

297
00:17:32,934 --> 00:17:34,405
Right.

298
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:00,305
BORCHERT HALL

299
00:18:00,461 --> 00:18:01,719
GREENDALE

300
00:18:02,213 --> 00:18:04,052
So you guys are all cloned up too,
huh?

301
00:18:04,215 --> 00:18:05,556
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

302
00:18:05,716 --> 00:18:07,887
- Believe in cloning.
- Well...

303
00:18:08,052 --> 00:18:09,179
CHILDISH
TYCOON

304
00:18:09,345 --> 00:18:11,066
Guess that's my ride.

305
00:18:11,222 --> 00:18:13,025
I'm so excited for you.

306
00:18:13,182 --> 00:18:14,736
You're gonna see the world...

307
00:18:14,892 --> 00:18:16,482
...and experience new cultures.

308
00:18:16,644 --> 00:18:20,571
All culture has been homogenized
by 50 years of American imperialism...

309
00:18:20,731 --> 00:18:23,068
...but at least the candy bar wrappers
will...

310
00:18:24,068 --> 00:18:25,871
God, there I go.

311
00:18:26,028 --> 00:18:28,365
Almost Britta'd our goodbye, huh?
I'm the worst.

312
00:18:28,531 --> 00:18:31,331
You're the best, and I love you.

313
00:18:33,244 --> 00:18:36,756
- I'm better at sex than Jeff, right?
- I've yet to have anyone worse.

314
00:18:40,209 --> 00:18:45,643
All I ever wanted in high school
was for Troy Barnes to notice me...

315
00:18:45,798 --> 00:18:47,934
...and then I ended up living with you.

316
00:18:48,092 --> 00:18:50,062
- I'm pretty lucky.
- I'm not.

317
00:18:50,219 --> 00:18:54,728
I had a chance to be your friend in high
school, but I was busy trying to be cool.

318
00:18:54,891 --> 00:18:57,524
I missed out on four more years
of Annie.

319
00:19:03,357 --> 00:19:05,694
You are the coolest guy I know.

320
00:19:06,068 --> 00:19:07,279
I hope I make you proud.

321
00:19:10,281 --> 00:19:12,915
I've never stepped foot
outside of Colorado.

322
00:19:13,075 --> 00:19:16,670
You're becoming much cooler than me
by doing this.

323
00:19:19,457 --> 00:19:22,257
- Thanks for looking out for me.
- Thank you for putting up...

324
00:19:22,418 --> 00:19:24,886
...with the boring, old mom
in your study group.

325
00:19:25,046 --> 00:19:26,469
You made a furniture fortress.

326
00:19:26,631 --> 00:19:28,802
You're the badass
from our study group.

327
00:19:35,473 --> 00:19:36,517
Clone Troy.

328
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,393
Clone Abed.

329
00:19:40,311 --> 00:19:42,815
When I cloned you, I had to
patch parts of your DNA...

330
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,736
...with genes from a homing pigeon.

331
00:19:44,899 --> 00:19:49,158
You may notice side effects,
like a compulsion to come back.

332
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,621
Cool. Clone hug?

333
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,000
You're really gonna pilot this thing
all on your own?

334
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,839
Pierce's will stated that someone...

335
00:20:04,001 --> 00:20:06,338
...would be assigned to me
to verify I don't cheat.

336
00:20:06,504 --> 00:20:08,509
Captain Barnes.

337
00:20:08,673 --> 00:20:12,350
We should set sail while the wind
is still in our favour, don't you think?

338
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:14,313
Engage.

339
00:20:26,482 --> 00:20:29,531
Troy, I know it's gonna be difficult
for you to interact with me...

340
00:20:29,694 --> 00:20:31,366
No, no. That was the original Troy.

341
00:20:31,529 --> 00:20:33,664
I'm his clone.
Let's get the lead out, Burton.

342
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,784
Aye, aye, sir.

343
00:20:56,637 --> 00:21:00,481
Starting from landlocked Colorado
may not have been the best idea.

344
00:21:00,641 --> 00:21:03,227
Drive to the river
then take the river to the ocean.

345
00:21:03,394 --> 00:21:04,735
I never thought I'd see you.

346
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:07,576
I have a couple Star Trek questions,
if you don't mind.

347
00:21:07,732 --> 00:21:09,535
No, go ahead.

348
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,574
"What time did you have to get up
in the morning?

349
00:21:14,739 --> 00:21:17,420
Every writer write for one character?
What's a best boy?"

350
00:21:17,575 --> 00:21:20,754
I saw it in the credits once.
"Why don't they call it Planet Trek?"

351
00:21:21,954 --> 00:21:23,876
You never go to a star.

352
00:21:24,499 --> 00:21:26,504
You... Not one episode.

353
00:21:27,305 --> 00:21:33,784
