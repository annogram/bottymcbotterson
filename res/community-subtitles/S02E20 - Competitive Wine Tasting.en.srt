1
00:00:01,369 --> 00:00:02,607
Don't forget, Greendale.

2
00:00:02,608 --> 00:00:05,740
It's the last day to sign up
for a spring semester elective!

3
00:00:06,222 --> 00:00:07,325
Horseback riding!

4
00:00:07,326 --> 00:00:09,371
Water skiing!
Fencing!

5
00:00:09,371 --> 00:00:12,573
Those are just a few classes
we can afford to offer

6
00:00:12,644 --> 00:00:14,371
if enough people
pay to learn hopscotch.

7
00:00:14,371 --> 00:00:16,306
Oh, they've got a class
on how to write jokes.

8
00:00:16,341 --> 00:00:17,440
Oh, don't take that.

9
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:19,141
I dropped it
after the lesson on setups.

10
00:00:19,176 --> 00:00:21,678
The Professor is <i>so old...</i>

11
00:00:25,004 --> 00:00:26,060
So many classes.

12
00:00:26,091 --> 00:00:27,391
I don't know what to choose.

13
00:00:27,425 --> 00:00:29,393
I'll give you the same advice
my father gave me

14
00:00:29,428 --> 00:00:31,028
the night I lost my virginity.

15
00:00:31,062 --> 00:00:32,063
"Just pick one.

16
00:00:32,097 --> 00:00:33,530
They all cost the same."

17
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:34,665
You could always take

18
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,768
"The Actor Inside"
with me and Troy.

19
00:00:38,103 --> 00:00:40,637
How'd you get dragged
into that one?

20
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:42,874
Our dance teacher encourages
us to take acting classes

21
00:00:42,908 --> 00:00:44,274
to tap into
our emotional cores,

22
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,911
so Troy and I both decided
to take it together.

23
00:00:46,945 --> 00:00:48,445
Hmm. Foosball was full?

24
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:49,646
I'm on the wait list.

25
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:50,450
Don't give up.

26
00:00:50,527 --> 00:00:51,856
I was on the wait list
for this media class

27
00:00:51,884 --> 00:00:53,741
for a year and a half
and I finally got in.

28
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,103
<i>"Who Indeed:</i>
<i>A Critical Analysis</i>

29
00:00:55,365 --> 00:00:56,965
<i>of Television's</i>
Who's the Boss?"

30
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,865
The professor of this class
is the author of this book.

31
00:00:58,866 --> 00:01:00,500
- We got him?
- I know.

32
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:02,176
So what are you taking, Jeff?

33
00:01:02,259 --> 00:01:03,115
Well, while you knuckleheads

34
00:01:03,115 --> 00:01:04,248
are expanding
your minds and souls,

35
00:01:04,373 --> 00:01:06,052
I'll be expanding my liver

36
00:01:06,054 --> 00:01:07,667
in "Italian Wine Tasting."

37
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:08,768
Oh! <i>Molto bene!</i>

38
00:01:09,167 --> 00:01:10,367
I'm taking that one, too.

39
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:13,575
Hmm. How do you say
"ha ha" in Italian?

40
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,418
I'll look it up.

41
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,706
Come on, Jeff, it'll be fun.
I can give you pointers.

42
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:22,546
I was drinking
their finest wines.

43
00:01:22,548 --> 00:01:24,212
I assume you have
your own wine cellar.

44
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:25,239
Pierce does.

45
00:01:25,397 --> 00:01:27,099
And it's, "ha ha!"

46
00:01:27,274 --> 00:01:28,417
Anyone can have a cellar.

47
00:01:28,418 --> 00:01:29,304
It's what's in it that counts.

48
00:01:29,399 --> 00:01:31,834
Pierce's has a special gym
with swings and saddles.

49
00:01:31,867 --> 00:01:34,036
Uh, we don't... we don't
discuss the special gym.

50
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:37,472
Attention, please.

51
00:01:37,481 --> 00:01:39,632
All elective forms must be in

52
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:41,099
by the end of the day.

53
00:01:41,664 --> 00:01:43,329
Oh, nice job, Manuel.

54
00:01:43,329 --> 00:01:45,734
And good news.
There's still plenty of room

55
00:01:45,735 --> 00:01:47,536
in my P.A. Announcements class.

56
00:01:47,811 --> 00:01:49,646
Just ten bucks an hour.

57
00:01:49,741 --> 00:01:54,241
Community 2x20 - Competitive Wine Tasting

58

Sync and corrected by vNaru
www.addic7ed.com

59
00:02:20,504 --> 00:02:21,521
You're taking this, too?

60
00:02:21,522 --> 00:02:22,167
Hell, yeah.

61
00:02:22,168 --> 00:02:24,307
Got drunk ladies,
fancy bathrooms,

62
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:27,069
and a room full of free coats.

63
00:02:27,997 --> 00:02:29,230
Sorry I'm late, man.

64
00:02:29,264 --> 00:02:30,264
I brought you a present.

65
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,633
Oh.

66
00:02:31,668 --> 00:02:33,801
From before
your chin dimple filled in.

67
00:02:34,817 --> 00:02:37,598
Uh, excuse me.

68
00:02:38,007 --> 00:02:39,375
- So sorry.
- Hmm!

69
00:02:40,597 --> 00:02:41,206
Wow.

70
00:02:42,009 --> 00:02:44,082
Who is the dumpling
with the nice Asian pair?

71
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,615
That's the first time
sexism has made me hungry,

72
00:02:46,649 --> 00:02:48,250
but she is something.

73
00:02:48,283 --> 00:02:50,252
I fear I may have
to let her see me nude.

74
00:02:50,391 --> 00:02:52,060
I might have to take
a shot myself.

75
00:02:53,658 --> 00:02:54,423
What's so funny?

76
00:02:54,437 --> 00:02:56,656
Well, why would a woman
want a Plymouth on cinder blocks,

77
00:02:56,656 --> 00:02:59,025
when she could have
a Testarossa, 500 horsepower

78
00:02:59,027 --> 00:03:00,157
with a six-speed stick?

79
00:03:00,211 --> 00:03:02,747
'Cause my stick is ribbed
for her pleasure.

80
00:03:02,931 --> 00:03:04,032
I think those are wrinkles.

81
00:03:04,882 --> 00:03:05,926
Let that breathe.

82
00:03:11,087 --> 00:03:13,407
Lingering scent, full body,

83
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:14,629
perfect nose.

84
00:03:14,631 --> 00:03:15,865
Very nice wine.

85
00:03:15,899 --> 00:03:17,365
I was talking about you.

86
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:18,753
Jeff Winger.

87
00:03:19,403 --> 00:03:20,579
Wu Mei Hong Long.

88
00:03:20,612 --> 00:03:23,328
Oh, what a lovely name
for a lovely...

89
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:24,943
Uh, not interested.

90
00:03:24,943 --> 00:03:26,955
Please take weird haircut,

91
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,056
stupid grin,

92
00:03:28,056 --> 00:03:30,491
and go sniff another dog's ass.

93
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,784
Hmm, the red dragon
ordered a number 37

94
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:38,187
with a side
of pork-fried snap.

95
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:45,182
When you get up close,
she's very homely.

96
00:03:47,097 --> 00:03:48,396
This is gonna be fun.

97
00:03:48,432 --> 00:03:50,031
I can't wait
till we choose stage names.

98
00:03:50,067 --> 00:03:51,003
Which do you think is better?

99
00:03:51,075 --> 00:03:54,277
Trevor St. McGoodbody
or David?

100
00:03:54,304 --> 00:03:55,861
I don't think you have
to worry about stuff like that.

101
00:03:55,862 --> 00:03:57,663
This class is
more about introspection.

102
00:03:59,293 --> 00:04:00,032
Drag.

103
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,479
Less of a drag.

104
00:04:05,776 --> 00:04:06,915
Quiet!

105
00:04:08,597 --> 00:04:10,045
Form a trust circle around me

106
00:04:10,046 --> 00:04:11,007
and sit on the floor.

107
00:04:11,054 --> 00:04:12,433
A trust circle?

108
00:04:12,435 --> 00:04:13,597
It's just a circle.

109
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,687
It's a circle.
Sit down.

110
00:04:17,927 --> 00:04:21,463
Acting is revealing,
expression.

111
00:04:21,497 --> 00:04:24,065
When we release pain,

112
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,802
we become visible
to each other.

113
00:04:26,836 --> 00:04:29,572
That is an actor's job.

114
00:04:29,605 --> 00:04:31,307
That and, you know,

115
00:04:31,341 --> 00:04:33,175
pretending to be other people.

116
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:34,377
Let's start with you.

117
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,966
Access and share with us

118
00:04:37,966 --> 00:04:40,367
a profoundly deep
and painful memory.

119
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:43,886
I'm on the playground.

120
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:46,733
Stop taunting me!

121
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:49,721
I just want to go
on the swings!

122
00:04:50,863 --> 00:04:52,019
Good.

123
00:04:52,105 --> 00:04:54,840
Early childhood
is a treasure trove of pain.

124
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,620
That happened this morning.

125
00:05:00,002 --> 00:05:01,170
You're up.

126
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,031
Me? Um...

127
00:05:03,031 --> 00:05:04,213
I don't...
I don't think, uh...

128
00:05:04,214 --> 00:05:05,687
I don't want you to think.

129
00:05:06,201 --> 00:05:06,997
Feel!

130
00:05:07,533 --> 00:05:08,439
Go back.

131
00:05:08,817 --> 00:05:10,466
Dig in. Emotilize.

132
00:05:10,466 --> 00:05:12,415
Something hurt you.

133
00:05:13,182 --> 00:05:14,350
Um...

134
00:05:14,899 --> 00:05:17,367
I was captain
of my high school football team.

135
00:05:19,055 --> 00:05:24,125
It was very hard being popular.

136
00:05:25,168 --> 00:05:26,223
What a loser.

137
00:05:26,223 --> 00:05:27,490
Okay, great.
Next person.

138
00:05:27,963 --> 00:05:30,199
I've always felt
somehow ignored,

139
00:05:30,233 --> 00:05:32,567
almost invisible.

140
00:05:32,601 --> 00:05:35,204
Like every time I go to say
something, somebody just...

141
00:05:35,237 --> 00:05:36,672
My uncle put his finger
in my no-no!

142
00:05:43,764 --> 00:05:47,500
This... this
is where acting begins.

143
00:05:55,057 --> 00:05:58,927
Welcome to "A Critical
Analysis of <i>Who's the Boss?"</i>

144
00:05:58,961 --> 00:06:01,463
I am Professor Peter Sheffield,

145
00:06:01,497 --> 00:06:06,869
and I'd like to begin
with a simple question...

146
00:06:06,903 --> 00:06:08,471
Who was the boss?

147
00:06:13,497 --> 00:06:14,225
Yes.

148
00:06:14,226 --> 00:06:15,192
Angela.

149
00:06:17,314 --> 00:06:20,249
Oh, well!
Class dismissed!

150
00:06:22,018 --> 00:06:23,853
No, calm down.
Calm down.

151
00:06:23,887 --> 00:06:26,488
I'm sorry, um...

152
00:06:26,523 --> 00:06:28,356
- Mister...?
- Abed.

153
00:06:28,391 --> 00:06:31,826
The answer is not
quite that simple, Mr. Abed.

154
00:06:31,862 --> 00:06:33,329
Few are.

155
00:06:34,531 --> 00:06:38,033
Now, if everyone
could please turn to page 12

156
00:06:38,067 --> 00:06:39,067
in my book...

157
00:06:39,101 --> 00:06:40,536
Loser!

158
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:42,704
You really have to finish
that whole book by tomorrow?

159
00:06:42,738 --> 00:06:43,805
Yeah, but it's a page-turner.

160
00:06:43,983 --> 00:06:46,199
I'm on the chapter where he
traces Tony Micelli's genealogy

161
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,331
all the way back to Caesar.

162
00:06:47,332 --> 00:06:49,199
Well, it's gotta be better
than wine tasting with Pierce.

163
00:06:49,446 --> 00:06:50,591
He refused to drink Pinot Noir

164
00:06:50,591 --> 00:06:52,425
because he thought it was French
for "black penis."

165
00:06:52,516 --> 00:06:54,682
And he's late. Again.

166
00:06:54,718 --> 00:06:56,552
It's not your fault.

167
00:06:56,586 --> 00:06:57,920
It's not your fault.

168
00:06:58,694 --> 00:07:00,093
Thank you

169
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:01,987
Oh, I'm sure he'll be here.

170
00:07:01,987 --> 00:07:04,088
He wouldn't miss a chance to pop
in and say something offensive.

171
00:07:04,317 --> 00:07:05,326
One day soon, that man's gonna

172
00:07:05,327 --> 00:07:06,627
run out of ways
to shock people.

173
00:07:06,795 --> 00:07:07,829
Everybody,

174
00:07:07,863 --> 00:07:09,598
this is Wu Mei,

175
00:07:09,632 --> 00:07:11,699
and we're getting married!

176
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:14,836
But it's not gonna be today.

177
00:07:19,404 --> 00:07:20,911
So, uh, you're getting married

178
00:07:20,911 --> 00:07:22,478
to that beautiful young thing?

179
00:07:22,512 --> 00:07:24,947
Well, uh, stranger things
have happened.

180
00:07:24,981 --> 00:07:26,481
No.
No, they haven't.

181
00:07:26,485 --> 00:07:27,625
You said you guys just met?

182
00:07:27,627 --> 00:07:29,360
Yesterday,
after wine tasting class.

183
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,665
I mentioned
that her breasts were larger

184
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,000
than most Asian women,

185
00:07:33,034 --> 00:07:35,161
and, uh,
we just got to talking.

186
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,798
Turns out Pierce has been
to China many times.

187
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,374
It's the only place
to get fireworks

188
00:07:39,408 --> 00:07:40,442
that are too dangerous
for Mexico.

189
00:07:40,475 --> 00:07:42,543
No. I go
to visit my factory.

190
00:07:42,577 --> 00:07:45,213
Hawthorne Wipes are the number
one moist towelette in Asia.

191
00:07:45,247 --> 00:07:47,548
Anyway, after a few minutes,
we both just knew

192
00:07:47,582 --> 00:07:49,617
we were meant to be
together forever.

193
00:07:49,651 --> 00:07:51,920
Or at least
until she gets heavy.

194
00:07:51,954 --> 00:07:55,189
And, uh, now we must leave you.

195
00:07:55,223 --> 00:07:57,192
Many plans to make.

196
00:07:57,225 --> 00:08:00,461
Yes, yes, big plans.

197
00:08:00,495 --> 00:08:02,997
Well, what are we gonna do?

198
00:08:03,031 --> 00:08:04,298
Plan an engagement party?

199
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,257
Are you out of your mind?!
This is a scam.

200
00:08:06,608 --> 00:08:09,009
She's after him for his money
or a green card or something!

201
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:09,970
They seem
to really like each other.

202
00:08:09,971 --> 00:08:11,841
Yeah, and Pierce married
three of his wives

203
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:13,172
after knowing them
less than a month.

204
00:08:13,197 --> 00:08:14,663
Maybe he's just a romantic.

205
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,478
Not that you
would understand romance.

206
00:08:16,512 --> 00:08:18,279
Don't preach to me
about romance, Annie.

207
00:08:18,314 --> 00:08:21,286
I had a three-way
in a hot air balloon.

208
00:08:21,286 --> 00:08:23,021
Fine, I guess I'll do it myself.

209
00:08:23,218 --> 00:08:25,487
- Want to go?
- Mm-hmm.

210
00:08:25,521 --> 00:08:28,355
Boy, he seems really worked up.

211
00:08:28,391 --> 00:08:30,591
Hey, don't take on his pain.

212
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:32,460
Tend your own garden.

213
00:08:35,965 --> 00:08:37,798
I'll see you in class.

214
00:08:41,003 --> 00:08:42,203
What's going on?

215
00:08:42,238 --> 00:08:44,739
Oh, um, I didn't have
a painful experience

216
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,032
to share in acting class,
so I made up this story

217
00:08:47,033 --> 00:08:48,445
about my uncle trying
to touch my butt.

218
00:08:49,191 --> 00:08:50,312
Britta's attracted
to men in pain.

219
00:08:50,374 --> 00:08:51,748
It helps her pretend
to be mentally healthy.

220
00:08:51,749 --> 00:08:52,597
- Really?
- Yeah.

221
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:53,817
I hadn't noticed.

222
00:08:53,913 --> 00:08:56,947
Troy? Nothing good
can come of this.

223
00:08:57,432 --> 00:08:58,245
Yeah.

224
00:08:58,865 --> 00:08:59,671
I'll have to think really hard

225
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:01,405
about how to defuse
the situation.

226
00:09:01,927 --> 00:09:03,052
No, uncle Lucius!

227
00:09:03,052 --> 00:09:05,490
I don't want to play
in the laundry room!

228
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,528
My emotions!

229
00:09:07,562 --> 00:09:09,697
My emotions!

230
00:09:15,037 --> 00:09:17,004
Actors dismissed.

231
00:09:18,315 --> 00:09:19,576
Uh, for homework,

232
00:09:20,105 --> 00:09:22,902
drink a glass of cognac
in a bathtub.

233
00:09:23,634 --> 00:09:27,053
Troy, I feel like I'm seeing
a whole different side of you.

234
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,350
There's just so much darkness.

235
00:09:30,485 --> 00:09:33,087
And my soul is darkening,

236
00:09:33,121 --> 00:09:37,692
and my heart is mad
at my kidneys, and...

237
00:09:37,726 --> 00:09:39,326
My mouth...

238
00:09:43,991 --> 00:09:45,604
See you tomorrow?

239
00:09:49,938 --> 00:09:51,538
Uh, hello.

240
00:09:51,573 --> 00:09:52,841
Oh, hi.
I'm glad you could come.

241
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:54,307
Please sit.

242
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,258
I felt like we got off
on the wrong foot yesterday,

243
00:09:58,259 --> 00:10:01,294
and I wanted to offer you
my, uh, other foot.

244
00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:05,120
First, let me just say how happy
I am for you both.

245
00:10:05,153 --> 00:10:06,388
Your parents
must be so excited.

246
00:10:06,422 --> 00:10:07,489
Are they coming to the wedding?

247
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:09,390
Oh, they would not miss it.

248
00:10:09,424 --> 00:10:12,860
My mother will make
the customary shark's fin soup,

249
00:10:12,894 --> 00:10:14,328
and my father will get drunk

250
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,898
and make bad impression
of Borat.

251
00:10:16,932 --> 00:10:18,577
Oh, so your parents don't mind

252
00:10:18,578 --> 00:10:20,480
having a son-in-law
roughly their age?

253
00:10:20,702 --> 00:10:24,773
No. Pierce
is a beautiful, wise man,

254
00:10:24,807 --> 00:10:26,775
very gentle soul.

255
00:10:26,777 --> 00:10:29,479
Uh, let me tell you
that I am a lawyer,

256
00:10:29,533 --> 00:10:31,267
so if you need any help at all

257
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,249
navigating the whole green card
immigration hassle.

258
00:10:34,283 --> 00:10:36,384
I am dual citizen already.

259
00:10:36,418 --> 00:10:39,321
Oh. Well, if you'd like me to
look at the prenup...

260
00:10:39,355 --> 00:10:41,188
I assume you have one.

261
00:10:41,222 --> 00:10:44,192
Yes, but my father's lawyers
will take care of this.

262
00:10:44,225 --> 00:10:47,861
After all, we must protect
our family fortune.

263
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,697
Hmm.

264
00:10:49,731 --> 00:10:50,899
Now I'm stumped.

265
00:10:50,932 --> 00:10:51,899
Excuse me?

266
00:10:51,933 --> 00:10:53,368
Uh, it was...

267
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:55,769
That means it was very nice
talking to you.

268
00:10:55,804 --> 00:10:57,438
Oh, okay, if you say so.

269
00:10:57,472 --> 00:10:59,573
- Okay. Right.
- Okay, good-bye.

270
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,711
Why were you grilling her?

271
00:11:04,576 --> 00:11:07,352
Listen, I'm gonna bust
into her apartment.

272
00:11:07,354 --> 00:11:08,547
Do you have
any grappling hooks.

273
00:11:08,548 --> 00:11:10,263
Maybe Pierce finally found
his soul mate.

274
00:11:10,264 --> 00:11:12,734
How can you say those things
without any trace of irony?

275
00:11:12,981 --> 00:11:14,793
That's why they call me
irony-free Annie.

276
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:17,716
Mm, trust me,
that's not what they call you.

277
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:25,899
Yes?

278
00:11:25,934 --> 00:11:28,536
Oh. Mr. Abed.
What can I do for you?

279
00:11:28,571 --> 00:11:29,971
I finished your book,
Professor,

280
00:11:30,005 --> 00:11:31,672
and I've been watching episodes
of <i>Who's the Boss?</i>

281
00:11:31,673 --> 00:11:33,875
And I think there's something
that you might have overlooked.

282
00:11:34,049 --> 00:11:36,850
Mr. Abed,
will you look at my wall?

283
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:38,399
- Mm-hmm.
- What do you see?

284
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,600
- Photographs.
- Of what?

285
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:40,749
- You.
- With whom?

286
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,894
Tony Danza, Judith Light,
Alyssa Milano,

287
00:11:43,081 --> 00:11:44,176
<i>Who's the Boss?</i>
Season three caterer,

288
00:11:44,177 --> 00:11:45,274
Gordon "Giddy-up" Galligan.

289
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:48,456
I have studied this show,
mister Abed.

290
00:11:48,591 --> 00:11:50,057
I am not a fan,

291
00:11:50,091 --> 00:11:51,960
I am not a groupie,

292
00:11:51,994 --> 00:11:54,395
I am an academic.

293
00:11:54,429 --> 00:11:57,131
When I ask the question,
"Who's the boss?"

294
00:11:57,165 --> 00:11:58,767
It is a rhetorical question.

295
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,774
When I ask the question beyond
the question, "What is a boss?"

296
00:12:01,775 --> 00:12:03,945
I really think it's Angela,
because if it's a boss...

297
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:07,225
Ok, listen, enough!

298
00:12:07,243 --> 00:12:08,275
I would like you to leave
my room.

299
00:12:08,309 --> 00:12:09,711
My mind is open, Professor.

300
00:12:09,745 --> 00:12:11,178
It's as open as the door
to Mona's bedroom.

301
00:12:11,212 --> 00:12:14,515
- It's a shame yours isn't.
- I beg your pardon?

302
00:12:14,549 --> 00:12:18,286
You know?
I just got a wonderful idea.

303
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,523
Why don't you teach
the next class?

304
00:12:21,557 --> 00:12:25,393
That way you can share your
open mind with everybody.

305
00:12:25,427 --> 00:12:26,827
Cool.
Cool cool cool.

306
00:12:26,861 --> 00:12:28,562
Pchew.

307
00:12:30,365 --> 00:12:31,644
I couldn't be more touched

308
00:12:31,644 --> 00:12:33,471
that you all threw us
an engagement party.

309
00:12:33,556 --> 00:12:34,956
You said if we didn't,
you'd slash our tires.

310
00:12:36,706 --> 00:12:37,753
She is funny.

311
00:12:38,094 --> 00:12:38,995
Like Oprah.

312
00:12:39,351 --> 00:12:40,572
Oprah's not a comedienne.

313
00:12:40,609 --> 00:12:44,745
No, you are funny,
and you are like Oprah.

314
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:46,480
Yeah.
What?

315
00:12:47,355 --> 00:12:47,900
Thank you.

316
00:12:47,902 --> 00:12:51,238
Pierce, I'd like to offer
my sincere congratulations.

317
00:12:51,277 --> 00:12:52,639
It's hard enough to find people

318
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,126
you can stand in this life,

319
00:12:54,128 --> 00:12:55,696
let alone someone
who's willing to stomach

320
00:12:55,697 --> 00:12:58,065
your imminent dementia
and present incontinence.

321
00:12:58,094 --> 00:12:59,226
Thank you, Jeff.

322
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,475
I just hope she can satisfy me.

323
00:13:01,475 --> 00:13:04,144
I'm like an insatiable baboon
in the bedroom.

324
00:13:04,232 --> 00:13:05,432
Don't sell yourself short.

325
00:13:05,467 --> 00:13:06,668
You're a baboon everywhere.

326
00:13:10,351 --> 00:13:11,167
Seems like just yesterday

327
00:13:11,168 --> 00:13:13,001
me and Abed
dined and ditched here.

328
00:13:18,576 --> 00:13:19,842
Here, hold this.

329
00:13:19,876 --> 00:13:21,778
Ugh, what is this?

330
00:13:21,812 --> 00:13:24,179
I always carry some spare apps
in case the wait staff's racist.

331
00:13:24,183 --> 00:13:25,291
Where's a napkin?

332
00:13:25,322 --> 00:13:26,456
Uh, here you go.

333
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:28,524
Oh, thanks.

334
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:29,826
Check that out.

335
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,663
Hats off to Pierce
and the hot red dragon.

336
00:13:32,697 --> 00:13:33,831
Why do you keep
calling her that?

337
00:13:33,865 --> 00:13:35,665
"Hong Long" means red dragon.

338
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,966
That's her middle name.

339
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,168
In China, they
put the last name first.

340
00:13:39,203 --> 00:13:41,203
I mean,
they're nuts over there.

341
00:13:42,157 --> 00:13:43,078
Hm-hmm.

342
00:13:47,778 --> 00:13:49,145
Thank you all for coming.

343
00:13:49,179 --> 00:13:50,581
I know it seems fast,

344
00:13:50,615 --> 00:13:52,883
but when you find the right
person, you just know it.

345
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:55,351
I know that because I've found
the right person seven times.

346
00:13:55,385 --> 00:13:58,388
So the drinks are on me,
but stick to the crappy stuff.

347
00:13:58,423 --> 00:14:00,389
I don't want to get corn-holed
on the bar tab.

348
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:03,826
Pierce, you can't just throw
around a term like that.

349
00:14:04,837 --> 00:14:05,855
Corn-hole.

350
00:14:05,948 --> 00:14:08,110
Corn-hole, corn-hole!

351
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:11,147
Pierce!
Troy was molested!

352
00:14:11,535 --> 00:14:12,535
Cool.

353
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:17,639
Troy, we didn't know.

354
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,807
Troy, do you need me
to recommend a support group?

355
00:14:20,097 --> 00:14:22,051
Hey, he's not a victim.

356
00:14:22,287 --> 00:14:23,754
You're a survivor.

357
00:14:30,047 --> 00:14:31,765
Yeah, about that...

358
00:14:32,119 --> 00:14:35,152
I wasn't so much "molested"

359
00:14:35,153 --> 00:14:38,388
as much as I "made it up."

360
00:14:38,557 --> 00:14:39,623
What?

361
00:14:39,707 --> 00:14:42,409
We're gonna laugh so hard
about this later.

362
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,100
I'd like to propose a toast.

363
00:14:44,235 --> 00:14:49,239
Wu Mei Hong Long, better known
as Mei Hong Long Wu,

364
00:14:49,274 --> 00:14:52,375
is not only
not a Greendale student,

365
00:14:52,409 --> 00:14:54,610
she works for Red Dragon Wipes,

366
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:57,548
the number two wipe in Asia,

367
00:14:57,581 --> 00:15:01,317
currently attempting
a takeover of Hawthorne Wipes.

368
00:15:01,351 --> 00:15:03,086
So please, raise your glasses

369
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,523
to saving Pierce from
the clutches of a corporate spy,

370
00:15:06,557 --> 00:15:09,058
and to me for being
attractive enough

371
00:15:09,092 --> 00:15:12,528
to get a girl like her
under normal circumstances.

372
00:15:14,486 --> 00:15:16,350
Very impressive, Veronica Mars.

373
00:15:16,351 --> 00:15:17,726
You learned how to use Google.

374
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,932
And you learned to fight
your physical desire for me.

375
00:15:20,106 --> 00:15:21,062
Oh, stick it.

376
00:15:22,023 --> 00:15:23,087
You suck.

377
00:15:24,274 --> 00:15:26,277
Wait, wait, wait.

378
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,780
Record scratch app.

379
00:15:40,081 --> 00:15:41,481
Where'd everybody go?

380
00:15:42,327 --> 00:15:43,538
Most people went home.

381
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:45,205
The rest went with Chang
to your place

382
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,424
to have a ketchup fight.

383
00:15:46,587 --> 00:15:47,650
Oh, jeez, I better
get back there

384
00:15:47,652 --> 00:15:49,352
before he starts
playing monkey drop.

385
00:15:49,827 --> 00:15:51,000
Don't ask.

386
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,000
Oh, uh, do you want to come?

387
00:15:53,371 --> 00:15:55,645
Why would I want to go
anywhere with Judas Winger?

388
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,855
You're mad at me?
You should be thanking me.

389
00:15:57,884 --> 00:16:00,500
For what?
Ruining my relationship?

390
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,716
What relationship?

391
00:16:01,817 --> 00:16:04,460
You just met the woman,
and the entire thing was a lie.

392
00:16:04,461 --> 00:16:06,908
She was just using you to get
your company in China.

393
00:16:06,909 --> 00:16:09,457
And I was just using her to
get her company in the sack.

394
00:16:10,081 --> 00:16:11,767
People use each other Jeff.

395
00:16:11,928 --> 00:16:13,179
It doesn't mean that
there aren't good feelings

396
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:14,567
that go along with it.

397
00:16:14,758 --> 00:16:15,677
I liked her.

398
00:16:16,616 --> 00:16:18,287
She was busty.

399
00:16:19,567 --> 00:16:20,610
I thought we had something.

400
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,308
I was trying to help you.

401
00:16:22,309 --> 00:16:23,418
I think what
you were trying to do,

402
00:16:23,419 --> 00:16:25,654
is prove that no woman
could want me.

403
00:16:37,645 --> 00:16:38,599
Oh, you're here.

404
00:16:39,211 --> 00:16:41,307
Look, Britta, I'm really sorry.

405
00:16:41,308 --> 00:16:43,360
Troy, kissing you
was a mistake.

406
00:16:43,368 --> 00:16:44,934
It will never happen again.

407
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,443
Good.

408
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,721
Before my ex-boyfriend Pablo
was arrested

409
00:16:49,722 --> 00:16:51,101
for forging church relics,

410
00:16:51,102 --> 00:16:52,946
he accused me
of only being attracted

411
00:16:52,947 --> 00:16:54,561
to a certain kind of guy.

412
00:16:54,562 --> 00:16:56,812
It was hard
to understand him, though.

413
00:16:56,812 --> 00:16:58,899
He was pretty huffed up
on paint thinners.

414
00:16:58,974 --> 00:17:02,509
Well, maybe someday, you'll
fall for someone who's healthy.

415
00:17:02,684 --> 00:17:03,775
Someone who,

416
00:17:03,777 --> 00:17:06,203
other than his irrational fear
of automatic toilets,

417
00:17:06,204 --> 00:17:08,804
is... normal.

418
00:17:11,248 --> 00:17:13,316
Who would like to begin today?

419
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:15,183
I would.

420
00:17:15,752 --> 00:17:16,984
With a confession.

421
00:17:18,005 --> 00:17:20,707
My uncle never stuck
his finger in my plop-plop.

422
00:17:21,326 --> 00:17:23,292
I know.
I'm bummed about it, too.

423
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:24,461
I'm sorry.

424
00:17:24,462 --> 00:17:26,424
I... want to be interesting.

425
00:17:26,425 --> 00:17:28,711
I want to fit in with you guys.

426
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:32,923
I want to be able
to be an actor.

427
00:17:42,203 --> 00:17:45,333
The pain
of not having enough pain

428
00:17:45,968 --> 00:17:47,319
is still pain, young man.

429
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,421
That may seem
like an easy resolution, but...

430
00:17:51,827 --> 00:17:52,944
We're not writers.

431
00:17:54,733 --> 00:17:56,142
We're actors.

432
00:17:58,204 --> 00:18:00,573
Story doesn't matter here.

433
00:18:03,477 --> 00:18:08,814
All that matters is our time

434
00:18:08,848 --> 00:18:10,509
in the spotlight.

435
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,647
And so,
by all known definitions

436
00:18:13,648 --> 00:18:15,950
of the word "boss," I.E.,
one with authority over another,

437
00:18:16,248 --> 00:18:18,147
in 9 of 11 known
possible fields

438
00:18:18,182 --> 00:18:20,961
in which one might teach,
employ, guide,

439
00:18:21,227 --> 00:18:22,851
oversee, and/or
otherwise hold dominion,

440
00:18:23,028 --> 00:18:24,828
the empirically provable answer

441
00:18:24,859 --> 00:18:28,628
to the question "who's the boss?" is...

442
00:18:31,195 --> 00:18:33,497
Angela Bauer.

443
00:18:42,906 --> 00:18:45,174
Class dismissed.

444
00:18:53,984 --> 00:18:57,221
Class dismissed!

445
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,867
There's a path you take
and a path untaken.

446
00:19:12,537 --> 00:19:15,038
The choice is up to you,
my friend.

447
00:19:41,398 --> 00:19:43,967
I wonder why Jeff and Abed
didn't show?

448
00:19:44,001 --> 00:19:46,302
Well, I don't know about Abed,

449
00:19:46,337 --> 00:19:49,105
but I'm sure Jeff just
found another life to destroy.

450
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,342
Are you still thinking
about studying acting?

451
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:52,730
I'm auditioning
for Professor Garrity's

452
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,902
all-black production
of <i>Fiddler on the Roof.</i>

453
00:19:55,075 --> 00:19:56,817
It's called <i>Fiddla Please.</i>

454
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,950
What's she doing here?

455
00:19:59,983 --> 00:20:01,384
I asked her to come.

456
00:20:01,419 --> 00:20:04,520
I was thinking, maybe you two
were meant to be together.

457
00:20:04,556 --> 00:20:06,880
You're both rude, you're
both deceitful and racist,

458
00:20:06,881 --> 00:20:09,449
and you both come
from moist wipe dynasties.

459
00:20:09,794 --> 00:20:11,210
I think having
that much in common

460
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:13,145
justifies at least one real date.

461
00:20:14,201 --> 00:20:15,644
I guess we could
go out to one dinner.

462
00:20:15,644 --> 00:20:17,480
- You're paying.
- You're dressing slutty.

463
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:18,323
Fine.

464
00:20:19,269 --> 00:20:20,703
How about Mexican?

465
00:20:20,739 --> 00:20:21,737
How about Thai?

466
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:23,621
They're like Chinese Mexicans.

467
00:20:23,955 --> 00:20:25,557
- Hmm, so true.
- Mmm.

476

477

Dreidels.
