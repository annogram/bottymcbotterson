1
00:00:01,084 --> 00:00:03,003
Eradicate! Eradicate!

2
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:06,006
Take that, Blorgon.

3
00:00:06,298 --> 00:00:07,799
Good show, inspector.

4
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:13,013
- There are 50 years of these, huh?
- Yeah, isn't it great?

5
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:17,351
We can go anywhere
and any time in the universe.

6
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:20,020
But it will probably be London
during the blitz.

7
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:22,314
I think I got Abed to agree
to let you come...

8
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:24,816
to the Inspector Spacetime
convention.

9
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:28,695
- You watching Inspector Spacetime?
- Why does he wake up so early?

10
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:31,156
Can't we just tell Abed
we're sleeping together?

11
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:34,952
No. No. Abed's fragile.
We have to ease him into it, okay?

12
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:38,413
Do we want him to freak out and have
to rescue him from some world...

13
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:41,833
where submarines are small enough
to enter the bloodstream?

14
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:43,293
I totally wanna do that.

15
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,712
We need to go over
the convention schedule again.

16
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:48,048
Go, go, go. Just a minute.

17
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:51,552
Troy, it's a week away, and we need
to revise our whole strategy.

18
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:58,392
Troy. I've printed out several maps
of the convention centre...

19
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:00,602
and color-coded
the best potential routes.

20
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,564
I have longer strides,
but your superior physical fitness...

21
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:06,900
will allow you to compensate
with greater speed. One thing's sure.

22
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:10,153
We need to save time by changing
into our costumes in the car.

23
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,242
- Curling iron.
- Thanks.

24

25
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,880
Coming.

26
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,845
Hi, Abed. Just here
for my breakfast date with Troy.

27
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,054
Good morning, Britta.

28
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:38,932
I haven't seen you in over 12 hours.

29
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,934
- Yeah.
- I know you two are having sex.

30
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,936
- I've known for weeks.
- What?

31
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:44,730
Why didn't you say something?

32
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,733
I love doughnuts.

33
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:54,615
♪ I can't count the reasons
I should stay ♪

34
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:57,706
I need to get my sunglasses
and then we can go.

35
00:01:57,993 --> 00:02:01,079
You don't need sunglasses to go
to an Inspector Spacetime convention.

36
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,081
For an Inspector Spacetime
convention...

37
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:06,585
I'd need a bag to put over my head.
But Annie and I are going skiing.

38
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:09,087
That is the only reason I agreed
to this road trip.

39
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,051
- What are you doing here?
- I always come early to save my seat.

40
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:15,802
And what's this about a road trip?

41
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,263
Look, Pierce,
no one was trying to leave you out.

42
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,432
We just assumed
you wouldn't be interested.

43
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:23,226
- Which is why we left you out.
- That's not fair.

44
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:25,854
Why can't I go
to a Captain Warptime convention?

45
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,146
Because you'll ruin it.

46
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:31,068
I'm getting sick of everyone assuming
that I have nothing to offer.

47
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,445
In ancient Greece,
it was considered an honor...

48
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:36,448
to invite a person my age
to a space convention?

49
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:40,243
- We didn't invite Shirley either.
- Well, that's better then.

50
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:42,287
- All right. Good night.
- Good night.

51
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,206
Good night.

52
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:49,044
Hey, yo!

53
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,630
- Oh, I know.
- Yeah.

54
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:53,757
I can't believe it,
our first InSpecTiCon.

55
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:55,049
It's beautiful.

56
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,594
Sure it's okay Britta's here?
She can wait in the car.

57
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,639
It's cool. Find the booth
where they take the gluon photo.

58
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:02,391
Two people are fused together...

59
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:06,478
like the inspector and Reggie were
bonded for eternity in episode 704.

60
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,231
Was there a female inspector?

61
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:12,067
Everyone hates her.
Not because they're sexist. She sucks.

62
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:13,777
Well, I think it's cool.

63
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:15,654
- Britta.
- Annie.

64
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:18,407
You're on your own, AI Capone.

65
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,418
Everyone's entitled
to their own opinion.

66
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:34,172
- Am I the only one freaked out by that?
- Abed was just showing...

67
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,508
that he's accepting
of our relationship.

68
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,801
No, really. What was it?

69
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:45,016
Hey, Annie, sad news.
They closed the ski slopes.

70
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,102
A dozen scouts got buried
in an avalanche.

71
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,354
So sad. I say we cut our losses
and head home.

72
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:52,941
We're already here. We can have
fun hanging out at the convention.

73
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,653
I'd have more fun hanging out with
the parents that are circling the block.

74
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,363
Why are people staring at you?

75
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,782
They've never seen a man
who's had sex before?

76
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,451
How many of those do you have?

77
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,995
Enough for the whole ride home.

78
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,664
- Jeff.
- What?

79
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:10,375
- We wanted it to be a surprise.
- You bear resemblance...

80
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,503
to Inspector Spacetime's
super villain Thoraxis.

81
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:18,717
Okay. Now we're definitely leaving.

82
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:22,387
I've never been on an adult vacation.
This is the first time I've stayed...

83
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,514
in a hotel without a number
in its name.

84
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,516
- You can stay.
- I'll be in my room.

85
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:29,352
Good. The reservation's
under my name. Enjoy the nerds.

86
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:32,481
I will enjoy the...

87
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,816
- Jeff won.
- I know.

88
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,361
Abed, the gluon photo line
looks really long.

89
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:41,531
- We should get in it now.
- Definitely. Right after I find Toby.

90
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:42,949
Who's Toby?

91
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,994
Toby Weeks. The biggest
Inspector Spacetime fan in the world.

92
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,038
We've been e-mailing for months.

93
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:52,000
- You never mentioned him.
- You've been busy lately having sex.

94
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,712
We talked about embracing change,
so I'm expanding my social circle.

95
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,507
I just hope he makes it.
He works in Nigeria in banking.

96
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,801
He almost couldn't come.
His money was tied up.

97
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:03,428
I sent him £700 and a plane ticket.
He should be here.

98
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,598
- Oh, Abed.
- There he is.

99
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,850
You must be Abed.

100
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,310
Inspector.

101
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,938
Before I forget, here is your cheque.

102
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,023
- Thanking you very much indeed.
- Nice.

103
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,400
You wouldn't believe
how many people I e-mailed.

104
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:20,195
- They completely ignored me.
- Toby, this is Britta.

105
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,447
- Fräulein.
- And my best friend, Troy.

106
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,785
- Where's your constable?
- My best friend Andrew.

107
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:29,329
His wife wouldn't let him go
at the last minute.

108
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:30,956
- She's such a Minerva.
- Minerva.

109
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:34,626
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. Minerva, what a bitch.

110
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:37,254
- Was that the female inspector?
- Not in front of Toby.

111
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:40,048
Hey, gluon line,
we should probably get in it right now.

112
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,969
Alternatively, someone might
just happen to have a pair of tickets...

113
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:45,428
to the sold-out panel:

114
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,390
Which inspector would win
in a fight in space?

115
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,642
Which inspector would win
in a fight in time?

116
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:52,477
We can get that photo later.

117
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:54,437
Yeah, later.

118
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:57,482
That was when I wanted to take it.

119
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,193
Are you sure
Troy and Abed want us here?

120
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,112
They do. They just don't know it yet.

121
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:04,656
Remember, we're a couple
of Captain Warphead fans.

122
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,449
Nobody will even notice we're here.

123
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,618
- Excuse me.
- Oh, yes?

124
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,121
- Will you come with us?
- Where? Why? When?

125
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:12,414
Okay.

126
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:22,090
- Room service.
- Yes, I'd like to order some food.

127
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,718
And how many people
will be dining today, Mrs. Winger?

128
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,636
Oh, I'm not...

129
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,431
Two.

130
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:32,225
Yeah, I'd like a turkey burger...

131
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,769
and a second turkey burger,
but with no bun.

132
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,480
My husband doesn't do carbs.

133
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,816
But he would like a scotch.

134
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,235
And what kind of scotch
would your husband prefer?

135
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:45,405
The good kind.

136
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:47,574
I'll see what we can do.

137
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:56,374
Yes, Mrs. Winger?

138
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:03,798
Excuse me,
I don't mean to bother you...

139
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:08,720
but are you Nigel Cuthbertson,
the actor who played Thoraxis?

140
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,390
Call me Nige.

141
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,352
We have every right to be here.

142
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:18,396
I don't know if you're being sexist,
ageist, racist, or what...

143
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,900
- but I don't think I like your "ist."
- Actually, we need your help.

144
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:25,695
We're focus-testing a new American
version of Inspector Spacetime...

145
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:29,532
and you two represent
several significant quadrants.

146
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:30,951
Oh, I don't know.

147
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:33,578
Your thoughts
would be very valuable to us.

148
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,996
We're in.

149
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,918
- Did you see...?
- Christmas special? Horrible.

150
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,212
- When you consider what it set...
- Brilliant.

151
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:45,090
- Is that...?
- Let's go.

152
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:46,424
What about the photo?

153
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:50,261
Do they even have to talk? They could
just touch tentacles and download.

154
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,973
This is good because, you know,
Abed's branching out...

155
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:55,809
and Toby's really, really great.

156
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:59,854
No. Troy, I have seen that look.
Girls have given me that look.

157
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,231
You are not being crazy.

158
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:04,275
That dude is trying
to steal your boyfriend.

159
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:05,944
I'm gonna get a refill.

160
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:15,870
I mean,
what if Abed wants to replace me?

161
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:19,791
It makes me so angry and sad
all at the same time.

162
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,543
I know, but you have to hide it.

163
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,629
Because for some reason,
men find these feelings to be psycho.

164
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,298
And if you freak out,
it's only gonna push Abed away.

165
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,633
Like I always say...

166
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:32,429
if you love someone, set them free.
And if they don't come back to you...

167
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:35,473
- they were never yours to begin with.
- That makes no sense.

168
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,559
What if they get hit
or fall down a well?

169
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,645
Remind me not to put you down
as my emergency contact.

170
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:42,522
All right.

171
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:44,149
Play it cool.

172
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:45,442
Make nice with Toby.

173
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:47,402
Yeah.

174
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:54,492
So, what did everyone think?

175
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,496
I thought it was pretty good.

176
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,165
I was confused.

177
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:01,499
And what confused you?

178
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,461
The time travel mostly.

179
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:05,795
Also the space travel.

180
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,298
Anything else?

181
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,009
How many clipboards you got?

182
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:15,263
Raise the Klaxon. Me lorry's plunging
it into the Thames, methinks.

183
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:19,059
Hey, do you mind
if I practise my American accent?

184
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,436
- I have an audition.
- Of course.

185
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,938
You really are
an Inspector Spacetime fan.

186
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,983
- Ever since I was little.
- What is it you like about the show?

187
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:32,155
I think the show's philosophy poses
some really interesting questions...

188
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:34,866
about the nature of... I'm so sorry.

189
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,158
Bow before Thoraxis.

190
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:38,620
This is my ringtone.

191
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,789
Bow before Thoraxis.

192
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,290
Okay, seriously, what was it?

193
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,542
You wear glasses?
You have a back brace?

194
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,002
Say it. I don't care.

195
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:50,924
And I asked myself,
what does space smell like?

196
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:55,220
- You see, the thing of it...
- Oh, hey, there you guys are.

197
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:59,557
This is so nice, just three friends,
friending around all unthreatened-like.

198
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,476
Sorry. This is slightly embarrassing.

199
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,853
- I seem to have forgotten your name.
- It's Troy!

200
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,271
You know it's Troy!

201
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,482
Okay, it's the first part
of Troy and Abed.

202
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,568
Toby and Abed in the morning?
That's ridiculous.

203
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,570
I'm not psycho!

204
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,073
Okay.

205
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:17,659
- Where was I?
- Troy's been acting weird.

206
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,744
Same with my constable
when he got a wife.

207
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:23,581
I now have one ticket to the 50th
anniversary convention in London.

208
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,084
DemiCenlnSpectiCon?
It's soon and London's too far.

209
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:27,919
Creme Eggs are sold year-round.

210
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:30,505
- I thought that was a legend.
- Past life as an...

211
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:32,673
Just a minute.

212
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:36,928
Just a second.

213
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:41,391
- I've got your hair dryer, Mrs. Winger.
- Thank you, Randy, but it's not for me.

214
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:44,394
It's for my husband.
He needs the diffuser for his hair.

215
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:46,938
It sounds shallow, but he's a lawyer.

216
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,525
Actually, having dual careers
has put a lot of stress on our marriage.

217
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:51,860
Hence the separate rooms.

218
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,779
But I think this trip
is really gonna change all that.

219
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:59,284
My husband will finally see me not
as a world-famous police detective...

220
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:01,411
but as a woman.

221
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:03,288
Your husband's a lucky man.

222
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:06,541
That he is.

223
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,464
Tastes of bog.

224
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,801
You see?
It's funny because it's clear.

225
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,804
I would like to say something.

226
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:24,142
I am friends with a couple
of huge Inspector Spacetime fans.

227
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:27,687
I think what they like about the show
is that it's smart, complicated...

228
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,647
doesn't talk down to its audience.

229
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:33,234
So if you'd like to make
a really good American version...

230
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,111
you should stay true to that.

231
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:38,198
Hey, instead of this constable...

232
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,743
what about a blonde with long legs
and a tennis racket?

233
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,244
Yeah.

234
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,831
Please, for me.

235
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,833
Bow before...

236
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,669
Normally we don't concern ourselves
with adultery...

237
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,713
because then hotels
wouldn't exist.

238
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:56,216
But everyone here thinks
you're so nice.

239
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:57,842
So I had to bring you down here.

240
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,678
I don't believe it.
He told me he was leaving.

241
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,348
Say your catchphrase.

242
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,351
I'd rather not.

243
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:09,479
What the hell is going on here?

244
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:12,190
Suddenly our marriage
isn't worth repairing?

245
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:13,858
What?

246
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:16,653
Wait, Nigel is married?

247
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,364
That is so Thoraxis.

248
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,952
And your American accent
isn't at all convincing.

249
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,537
We come all this way...

250
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:30,792
and you just leave me alone without
so much as sending a text message?

251
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,878
I am sick of it, Jeff... Nigel Winger.

252
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:37,715
- Can I get two more of these, please?
- Enough!

253
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,802
This day has turned crazy.

254
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,054
I'm gonna go upstairs, towel off...

255
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:46,015
and pray to God
that I wake up in the middle of a final...

256
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,893
for a class I didn't know
I was enrolled in.

257
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,074
Oh, honey.

258
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,994
You went all psycho girlfriend
on Abed, didn't you?

259
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,204
Yeah. I screwed up.

260
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:09,497
Classic Troy.

261
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,916
It's okay.
It happens to the best of us.

262
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,501
I got you a present.

263
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,504
A quantum spanner.

264
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:22,010
Yeah, it lights up or plays music
or something.

265
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,888
Britta, would you agree
to be bonded to me forever...

266
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,683
in the gluon chamber
for an expensive photograph?

267
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,184
Absolutely.

268
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,438
Thank you.

269
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,231
What?

270
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,569
I can't wait. We can visit
the original Spacetime set.

271
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:42,071
I've got a spare bedroom.
Stay as long as you like.

272
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,532
Sounds great.
But I don't know if I could leave.

273
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,451
- I have a life here.
- For now.

274
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,620
- What do you mean?
- Well, neurotypicals don't have...

275
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:52,623
the same focus you or I have.
They always get distracted...

276
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,293
by marriage, kids,
competitive cooking shows.

277
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:57,754
- Like your best friend David.
- That's right.

278
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:00,631
Planning on coming even though
you were trapped in Nigeria?

279
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,133
Yeah, I wouldn't say trapped.

280
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:04,385
You went to me
and not your friend for help?

281
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,845
His wife deleted the e-mail.

282
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:07,497
- She's a total Minerva.
- Minerva.

283
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:12,560
Right. You're dressed as the inspector
famous for trying to strangle Dudley...

284
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,480
because they were pursuing Linda.
David doesn't exist.

285
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,982
You're mad.
Nothing you've said can prove that.

286
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,567
You said his name was Andrew.

287
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,402
- Bollocks.
- Yeah.

288
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,737
All right.

289
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,029
Guilty as charged.

290
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,658
Look, I had to be sure, didn't I?

291
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,286
When you sent that e-mail
in which you figured out...

292
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:33,956
Inspector Spacetime is both his
own grandfather and grandmother...

293
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,917
I knew we were soul mates.

294
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,460
You and I are special.

295
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:39,170
Neurotypicals won't admit it...

296
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:41,589
but some people are better
than everybody else.

297
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,424
They can't handle it, so they leave.

298
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,344
Like how the brilliant inspector
has constant adventures...

299
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:50,681
while his constables always return
to their dull, ordinary Earth lives.

300
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:55,186
Maybe there's a reason the inspector
always chooses a human companion.

301
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:58,439
His human friends keep him grounded
and invested in the world...

302
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,024
like with me and Troy.

303
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:03,111
- If I could Winger you.
- Sure. I don't know what that means.

304
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:06,864
Maybe all relationships are made up
of logical inspectors...

305
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,200
and emotional constables,
and we need both...

306
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:12,203
to make space and time
a better place.

307
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,663
Maybe you're right.

308
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:21,504
Wait, wait. Toby, Toby.
Toby, no. Wait just a second.

309
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:25,842
Just playing a game.

310
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:38,229
- You have to let me out.
- Not until Stockholm syndrome sets in.

311
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,314
How long do you think that will be,
hours?

312
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,400
Would you love me
if I got you a churro?

313
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,027
Annie.

314
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,864
Annie, I have...

315
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,876
I'm not sure
how much air there is in here.

316
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:01,544
And still you talk.

317
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:04,172
- Troy will find me.
- Who?

318
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,257
You know who Troy is.

319
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:08,885
Yeah.

320
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,220
Troy will find me.

321
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:14,974
Okay, just hold it there.
Okay, and right here.

322
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:16,767
Everything okay?

323
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,686
Everything's fine.

324
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,607
- What is a gluon anyway?
- Can we stop talking about Abed?

325
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:25,151
I'm sorry.

326
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:27,612
I can't. It doesn't feel right.

327
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:31,240
It's okay, I understand. Go to him.

328
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:34,118
- Are you sure?
- I've told you before.

329
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,455
I don't care
about Inspector Spacetime.

330
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,510
Toby.

331
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:51,844
Where's Abed?

332
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:55,473
He's packing. He said you have a
girlfriend and don't need him anymore.

333
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:57,141
He's coming with me to England.

334
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,976
You're lying.

335
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,268
How would you know?

336
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,105
Because Abed's my friend,
and he would have told me.

337
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:06,025
And he would have explained it to me
in very clear terms...

338
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:07,818
because I get confused
sometimes.

339
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,863
He's in there, isn't he?

340
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,155
No.

341
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:13,491
- Hey, Troy.
- Hey, Abed.

342
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,994
Toby,
have you ever been in a fight?

343
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,286
Because I have.

344
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:21,832
Oh, my God. He can make a fist.
That would hurt harder than a slap.

345
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,459
He's in that one.

346
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,462
I know that.

347
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:31,342
You okay?

348
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:34,679
I am. You know, for the first time
in my long history...

349
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:38,099
of being locked inside things,
I knew someone would come.

350
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:45,314
- Still wanna take the gluon photo?
- What do you think?

351
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,191
- Yes.
- Yes.

352
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:56,826
Well, I just went upstairs
and saw your room.

353
00:17:57,118 --> 00:18:00,037
Saw the two robes,
the two coffee cups...

354
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,331
one with lipstick, one without.

355
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,875
And I saw actual hair
that looked a lot like mine...

356
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,461
on my side of the sink,
so I have some questions.

357
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,673
- Oh, God.
- First one, is that actually my hair?

358
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:12,758
And, if so, did it fall out naturally?

359
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:16,429
If it did, you need to tell me right now
because I have to call science.

360
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:18,723
Also, what the hell is going on?

361
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:22,643
All right, I may have been play-acting
that we were married...

362
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:26,147
and then the staff thought you
were cheating, and I had to save face.

363
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,732
Do I have to worry about this?

364
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:30,484
No, I was just daydreaming.

365
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,279
I've married you
at least a half a dozen times.

366
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:36,240
And Troy. And Zac Efron.

367
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:37,575
Mostly Zac Efron.

368
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:40,161
Does Zac get a drink
thrown in his face?

369
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:46,417
I don't know. I guess
I was a little hurt that you ditched me.

370
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:49,337
I mean, we are friends, right?

371
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:52,423
Would it have been that painful
to hang out together?

372
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:55,676
Well, I can tell you one thing
your fantasy got wrong.

373
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:58,012
If we were married...

374
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:01,807
you wouldn't find me flirting
with another woman in a hotel bar.

375
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:05,519
But there are a lot of things
that you think are fun...

376
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,563
that I wouldn't wanna do
because I'm...

377
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,523
- Older?
- Not lame.

378
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,110
Do you wanna hang out now?

379
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:16,364
Can I buy you a drink?
What do you want?

380
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:21,744
- An appletini.
- Oh, God, don't make me order that.

381
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:24,163
- Please?
- Please?

382
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,462
Appletini.

383
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,964
That is so great.

384
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,384
And I have a surprise for you guys.

385
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,262
- Really pushing me here.
- He's back.

386
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:44,308
Do you mind if we crash this party?
That we already crashed.

387
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,268
Pierce, Shirley, I'm glad you made it.

388
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,479
It was rude of me not to invite you.
Sorry.

389
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:52,650
- Just remember, Abed, I did my best.
- We both did.

390
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:56,487
- You're welcome.
- So I guess we're taking off.

391
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:59,031
Actually,
I'd like to stay for a little while.

392
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,658
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

393
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,660
You don't have to do that for me.

394
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:05,079
Well, who says it's just for you?

395
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:06,580
Guys, get your phones ready.

396
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,749
Because you are only
gonna see this once.

397
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:19,176
Bow before Thoraxis!

398
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:21,762
Get your camera out.

399
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:26,475
See, this is why I don't hang
with you folks on the weekends.

400
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:39,739
Here we are, the 1960s...

401
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,199
the greatest, grooviest period...

402
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:46,328
in the entire history
of the entire universe.

403
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:49,206
I'm lucky.
I get to visit places like this...

404
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:53,753
because I can travel
through time and space...

405
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,671
but not both at once.

406
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:58,758
Do you know why that is, ensign?

407
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:01,510
Because, Inspector Spacetime...

408
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:05,556
our minds would be blown
with the space-time confusion.

409
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:07,224
That's right.

410
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,561
And now I must sleep
with the sexiest woman here...

411
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:13,105
who is also my grandmother.

412
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,274
Or I will cease to exist.

413
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:17,318
How do you know
I'm not your grandmother?

414
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,320
There's only one way to find out.

415
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:23,491
I hate you.

415
00:21:24,305 --> 00:21:30,460
