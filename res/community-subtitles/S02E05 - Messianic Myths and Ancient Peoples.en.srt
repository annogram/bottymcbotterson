1
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,733
We was camping,
and we was eating,

2
00:00:06,111 --> 00:00:09,185
and it was a mountain lion jump
all the way down and eat my leg.

3
00:00:10,325 --> 00:00:13,685
I think a mountain lion jump
down and eat someone's grammar.

4
00:00:13,686 --> 00:00:15,152
The auto-tune
remix is way better.

5
00:00:15,153 --> 00:00:16,956
Go to related videos. - Uh-huh.

6
00:00:16,957 --> 00:00:21,849
We was... we was camping, camping,
we was eeeeeeating, eating...

7
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:24,345
- Professor?
- Oh, Annie, please don't start.

8
00:00:24,346 --> 00:00:25,394
We've been through this.

9
00:00:25,395 --> 00:00:27,780
Anthropology is the
study of humanity.

10
00:00:27,781 --> 00:00:29,107
Nothing is off topic.

11
00:00:29,282 --> 00:00:31,215
No, it's just,
I've seen this one.

12
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:33,879
Put in "car crash camel toe."

13
00:00:33,884 --> 00:00:38,839
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
"Ski lift ninja crotch rip."

14
00:00:38,942 --> 00:00:41,323
Whoo! I'm a ski lift ninja!

15
00:00:41,324 --> 00:00:42,535
Oh!

16
00:00:46,553 --> 00:00:48,568
Look, Dolly Parton
eating a hot dog.

17
00:00:48,668 --> 00:00:50,153
- Stop that!
- Yeah.

18
00:00:50,514 --> 00:00:51,829
I can do what I want.

19
00:00:52,086 --> 00:00:54,340
Uh, what happens
if you type in "God"?

20
00:00:54,341 --> 00:00:55,634
Boo!

21
00:00:56,961 --> 00:00:58,546
No, no, no, no, no.
Do not boo her.

22
00:00:58,547 --> 00:01:01,692
This subject's lack of
definition cuts both ways.

23
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:04,294
If farts are fair game, so is God.

24
00:01:04,918 --> 00:01:06,699
Top hit, "God of farts."

25
00:01:08,064 --> 00:01:10,082
- You ask for it...
- It balances out.

26
00:01:12,046 --> 00:01:13,909
That's blasphemous.
Who wants to see that?

27
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:17,087
- 17 million people.
- Oh.

28
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,919
There were nine people
at my church last night.

29
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:26,361
Auto-tune God of farts. - Yeah!

30
00:01:26,362 --> 00:01:28,418
Yeah!...
way ahead of you.

32
00:02:06,907 --> 00:02:08,967
Abed, guess who's got two thumbs

33
00:02:08,968 --> 00:02:11,034
and has an exciting career
opportunity for you?

34
00:02:11,754 --> 00:02:12,768
This guy.

35
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,383
I'm pointing my thumbs at God.

36
00:02:15,513 --> 00:02:17,193
I'm using one thumb
to say that's great.

37
00:02:17,194 --> 00:02:19,014
Um, I told my
pastor about YouTube

38
00:02:19,015 --> 00:02:20,456
and how there's no light
there for the kids,

39
00:02:20,457 --> 00:02:21,809
and our church wants to sponsor

40
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,916
the making of a viral video
with a Christian message.

41
00:02:23,917 --> 00:02:26,010
Ha! What are you gonna do,
"rapping Jesus"?

42
00:02:26,011 --> 00:02:27,119
Pierce, please just step aside

43
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,529
and make room for
a new generation.

44
00:02:28,921 --> 00:02:31,789
Um, Abed, would you like to
make a Christian YouTube?

45
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:32,782
I know you're Muslim.

46
00:02:32,783 --> 00:02:33,935
As a Muslim,
I'd be happy to do it.

47
00:02:33,936 --> 00:02:35,254
As a filmmaker, no way.

48
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:36,630
I'm a storyteller, not a preacher.

49
00:02:36,631 --> 00:02:39,710
Well, the Bible has been called
the greatest story ever told.

50
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,918
Ben Lyons said the same
thing about I am legend.

51
00:02:42,213 --> 00:02:45,008
Oh, well, I'll have
to rent that, then.

52
00:02:45,946 --> 00:02:47,872
- Whoa.
- What?

53
00:02:48,341 --> 00:02:49,849
That's a lot of
pasta for no veggies.

54
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,428
You're not in
charge of what I eat.

55
00:02:51,429 --> 00:02:53,139
That's true. Britta!

56
00:02:57,426 --> 00:02:59,643
And some damn broccoli, please.

57
00:02:59,911 --> 00:03:01,837
Pierce has been
acting out a lot lately.

58
00:03:01,838 --> 00:03:03,159
Maybe you should talk to him.

59
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:05,582
How is that my job?

60
00:03:06,016 --> 00:03:07,670
Aren't you, like, the dad?

61
00:03:07,671 --> 00:03:09,934
Would the dad walk away
from this conversation?

62
00:03:10,355 --> 00:03:11,267
No?

63
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,574
Ah!

64
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,080
You're having cookies for lunch?

65
00:03:18,081 --> 00:03:20,320
- Yeah.
- Hey, you didn't pay for those.

66
00:03:20,363 --> 00:03:21,632
Call a cop.

67
00:03:24,457 --> 00:03:25,858
Heads up, gay wads.

68
00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:27,963
- Hey!
- Cookies!

69
00:03:28,213 --> 00:03:30,124
***

70
00:03:31,937 --> 00:03:33,498
What are you looking at?

71
00:03:33,942 --> 00:03:34,987
Your face.

72
00:03:34,988 --> 00:03:37,157
That's what you're
supposed to look at.

73
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:38,392
So?

74
00:03:38,393 --> 00:03:40,050
So? You gonna sit down or what?

75
00:03:40,051 --> 00:03:43,527
Oh, no, I usually sit
with the younger people.

76
00:03:43,528 --> 00:03:46,020
Well, la de da de da.

77
00:03:46,021 --> 00:03:47,974
No, no, we watch
videos on "youtune,"

78
00:03:47,975 --> 00:03:50,446
and you guys probably don't
even know what that is.

79
00:03:50,447 --> 00:03:51,491
We don't care.

80
00:03:51,492 --> 00:03:52,613
Pierce, are you looking for us?

81
00:03:52,614 --> 00:03:54,416
We're sitting over there.
I can see!

82
00:03:54,417 --> 00:03:56,929
Sheesh! Did you take your pills?

83
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,227
- Ooh!
- Mama's boy.

84
00:03:59,228 --> 00:04:01,718
We're having a private
conversation here.

85
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:03,606
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. Um, hi.

86
00:04:03,607 --> 00:04:06,244
I'm... I'm Britta, Pierce's...
Pbbt!

87
00:04:07,495 --> 00:04:09,638
Very nice meeting you guys.

88
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:14,377
"Very nice meeting you guys."

89
00:04:16,913 --> 00:04:18,041
She's a lesbian.

90
00:04:26,189 --> 00:04:27,300
- Shirley.
- Hmm?

91
00:04:27,301 --> 00:04:29,789
- I read the new testament.
- The whole thing?

92
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,159
You know, being
raised by TV and movies,

93
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,872
I always thought that
Jesus just walked on water

94
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:34,299
and told people not
to have abortions,

95
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,804
but it's so much cooler than that.

96
00:04:35,827 --> 00:04:38,800
He was like E.T., Edward Scissorhands,
and Marty McFly combined.

97
00:04:39,652 --> 00:04:41,132
I would love to
make a Jesus movie.

98
00:04:41,133 --> 00:04:43,165
Oh, Abed, that's wonderful!

99
00:04:43,171 --> 00:04:44,409
What do you think we should do?

100
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,094
It needs to be cool and addictive,

101
00:04:46,095 --> 00:04:48,385
like that video of the
kitten falling asleep.

102
00:04:48,386 --> 00:04:49,301
Absolutely.

103
00:04:49,302 --> 00:04:50,347
But the story's
been told to death,

104
00:04:50,348 --> 00:04:51,790
so I want to approach
it in a new way.

105
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,465
We need a Jesus movie for
the post post-modern world.

106
00:04:54,776 --> 00:04:57,830
Like Jesus as a rapper?

107
00:04:57,831 --> 00:04:58,707
No.

108
00:04:59,564 --> 00:05:00,778
I want to tell the story of Jesus

109
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:03,381
from the perspective of a filmmaker
exploring the life of Jesus.

110
00:05:03,382 --> 00:05:06,332
That sounds very
appealing to filmmakers.

111
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,491
See, in the filmmaker's film,
Jesus is a filmmaker

112
00:05:08,492 --> 00:05:09,973
trying to find God
with his camera.

113
00:05:09,974 --> 00:05:12,075
But then the filmmaker realizes
that he's actually Jesus

114
00:05:12,076 --> 00:05:13,646
and he's being filmed
by God's camera.

115
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,127
And it goes like that
forever in both directions,

116
00:05:15,128 --> 00:05:15,987
like a mirror in a mirror,

117
00:05:15,988 --> 00:05:17,343
because all of the
filmmakers are Jesus,

118
00:05:17,344 --> 00:05:20,698
and all their cameras are God,
and the movie is called Abed.

119
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:23,194
All caps.

120
00:05:23,195 --> 00:05:26,224
Filmmaking beyond film.
A metafilm.

121
00:05:26,337 --> 00:05:27,666
My masterpiece.

122
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:32,035
- But I don't like it.
- Well, that's okay.

123
00:05:32,036 --> 00:05:34,022
You know, you're reacting the
way the world did to Jesus.

124
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,403
I'm reacting the
way the world does

125
00:05:36,404 --> 00:05:38,922
to movies about making
movies about making movies.

126
00:05:38,923 --> 00:05:40,140
I mean, come on, Charlie Kaufman,

127
00:05:40,141 --> 00:05:42,013
some of us have work
in the morning, damn.

128
00:05:42,022 --> 00:05:43,642
Does this mean you don't
want to work on the movie?

129
00:05:44,217 --> 00:05:45,823
This means there is no movie.

130
00:05:52,263 --> 00:05:53,836
This is the movie.

131
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,616
The game is Jacks
and deuces wild.

132
00:05:57,617 --> 00:06:00,712
Except if the dean comes in,
and then it's bingo.

133
00:06:03,678 --> 00:06:05,421
Keep it. I've got another one.

134
00:06:06,316 --> 00:06:10,327
If you get caught with that, just
say it's your 90th birthday.

135
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,095
Suddenly, it's adorable.

136
00:06:13,251 --> 00:06:14,221
That's right.

137
00:06:14,225 --> 00:06:17,066
All right, now.
What is this again?

138
00:06:17,783 --> 00:06:19,390
B-19.

139
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,305
No. B-19, my butt.

140
00:06:21,306 --> 00:06:23,710
I told you guys no poker,
all right?

141
00:06:23,711 --> 00:06:25,630
Shut this down!

142
00:06:25,631 --> 00:06:28,192
Shut your mouth down, fruit.

143
00:06:28,193 --> 00:06:31,228
Oh, hey, unacceptable,
and none of your business,

144
00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:32,501
and barely the whole truth.

145
00:06:32,502 --> 00:06:34,929
All right, everyone go home.

146
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,461
- Excuse me, mister?
- What, Pierce?

147
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:39,118
What year is it?

148
00:06:39,119 --> 00:06:40,016
What?

149
00:06:40,684 --> 00:06:42,656
Poker helps him remember.

150
00:06:43,714 --> 00:06:44,710
Veronica.

151
00:06:55,119 --> 00:06:56,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

152
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,052
You are okay, kid.

153
00:06:58,053 --> 00:06:59,525
Go ahead and deal. Let's go.

154
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,932
Jesus, did you really die
for our sins? That's dopey.

155
00:07:02,933 --> 00:07:04,539
Oh, uh, dope.

156
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:08,338
Ooh, freudian slip, perhaps due
to my feeling kind of dopey.

157
00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:09,749
Do the line, atheist.

158
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,077
Jesus, did you really
die for our sins?

159
00:07:12,078 --> 00:07:13,511
That's dope.

160
00:07:14,188 --> 00:07:15,559
You think that's dope?

161
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,051
Check out these... beatitudes.

162
00:07:25,965 --> 00:07:28,092
Blessed be the peacemakers,
word to the meek,

163
00:07:28,093 --> 00:07:32,546
the kingdom of heaven is open all
week, Jesus and me were... oh!

164
00:07:32,859 --> 00:07:34,425
I have arrived!

165
00:07:34,426 --> 00:07:37,224
I am watched, as I am watching.

166
00:07:37,685 --> 00:07:41,188
I am audience and creation.

167
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:45,303
The earth shall know my power!

168
00:07:45,454 --> 00:07:47,193
Abed, what are you doing?

169
00:07:47,194 --> 00:07:49,615
Oh, great! You blew the take!

170
00:07:49,616 --> 00:07:51,890
No, no, keep rolling.

171
00:07:53,237 --> 00:07:54,763
This can all be part of it.

172
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,562
There are no takes.

173
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,098
There is no viewer.

174
00:07:59,851 --> 00:08:01,294
The film is the story.

175
00:08:01,295 --> 00:08:02,795
The story is us.

176
00:08:03,318 --> 00:08:05,435
We are the film.

177
00:08:05,436 --> 00:08:06,666
It's totally meta.

178
00:08:06,667 --> 00:08:09,495
Well, let's get back to our
non-meta production, shall we?

179
00:08:09,496 --> 00:08:11,624
Come on. - No,
I want to watch this.

180
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:12,960
Troy, there's no time.

181
00:08:13,513 --> 00:08:15,855
Then, we quit. Right, Britta?

182
00:08:15,856 --> 00:08:18,987
I don't even believe in God,
but I love me some Abed.

183
00:08:18,988 --> 00:08:20,003
Yeah.

184
00:08:21,121 --> 00:08:22,223
Wait, wait.

185
00:08:36,278 --> 00:08:39,091
"The story of the
story is the story."

186
00:08:39,251 --> 00:08:41,342
Sure, that'll play
in poughkeepsie.

187
00:08:41,483 --> 00:08:44,275
I heard some theaters are
gonna show it in reverse.

188
00:08:44,276 --> 00:08:46,910
I heard it's the same
movie backward and forward.

189
00:08:46,911 --> 00:08:49,195
I heard the deleted
scenes are the scenes

190
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,409
and the scenes are
the deleted scenes.

191
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,462
I heard Jesus died for our sins.

192
00:08:54,151 --> 00:08:55,198
Oh, hey, guys,

193
00:08:55,624 --> 00:08:58,175
the director's answering
questions in the cafeteria,

194
00:08:58,176 --> 00:09:00,829
and it both is and isn't
part of the movie!

195
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,148
- Ah!
- Get a table!

196
00:09:05,027 --> 00:09:08,267
Abed, are we all in
the movie right now?

197
00:09:09,705 --> 00:09:12,905
We are all in a movie,
even when there are no cameras.

198
00:09:13,876 --> 00:09:15,693
When will the movie be released?

199
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:17,751
When is life released?

200
00:09:18,807 --> 00:09:20,739
Every minute of our lives
is a world premiere,

201
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,603
and my father has already
bought the popcorn.

202
00:09:22,608 --> 00:09:23,806
Whoa!

203
00:09:24,401 --> 00:09:27,898
Excuse me, Abed, but you
aren't actually trying to say

204
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:30,466
that you're Jesus, are you?

205
00:09:30,727 --> 00:09:32,761
I am who you say I am.

206
00:09:33,774 --> 00:09:35,084
Oh, man.

207
00:09:35,573 --> 00:09:39,056
Okay, yeah, ooh, it's meta now.

208
00:09:39,057 --> 00:09:40,460
Except here's the thing.

209
00:09:40,461 --> 00:09:42,708
I'm a devout Christian,
and you guys

210
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:45,651
are feeding into this
poor boy's delusions.

211
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:49,245
So cool! She's an actual
real life pharisee!

212
00:09:49,308 --> 00:09:51,828
Hey, bitch, why don't you
go back to your temple?

213
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:52,748
Yeah!

214
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,088
Why don't you all
stop confusing Jesus

215
00:09:56,089 --> 00:09:59,228
with an egotistical
filmmaking lunatic?

216
00:10:02,124 --> 00:10:03,353
I forgive her.

217
00:10:20,144 --> 00:10:22,730
So, how's your film going, Abed?

218
00:10:22,731 --> 00:10:23,959
Blasphemously.

219
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,330
It's not blasphemy to say
that we are God, Shirley.

220
00:10:27,149 --> 00:10:28,502
First Corinthians:

221
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:32,991
"He who unites himself with the
lord is one with him in spirit."

222
00:10:32,992 --> 00:10:34,839
Did you just
scripture me, Muslim?

223
00:10:35,118 --> 00:10:36,307
Jesus was Jewish.

224
00:10:36,308 --> 00:10:38,003
Are you ever gonna let that go?

225
00:10:38,061 --> 00:10:40,302
Hey. No religious talk.

226
00:10:42,582 --> 00:10:43,808
Somebody's late.

227
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,862
What is that in your pocket?

228
00:10:46,522 --> 00:10:48,716
Jeff, Britta,
Pierce is smoking cigars.

229
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,145
What's it to you, butt-breath?

230
00:10:52,669 --> 00:10:53,791
Look at your eyes.

231
00:10:53,792 --> 00:10:55,212
Have you been out all
night with those hipsters?

232
00:10:55,213 --> 00:10:56,270
Hipsters?

233
00:10:56,271 --> 00:10:58,345
That pack of old people that
hang out in the cafeteria.

234
00:10:58,346 --> 00:11:00,423
People call them hipsters 'cause
they all have hip replacements.

235
00:11:00,424 --> 00:11:01,806
They do not.

236
00:11:02,167 --> 00:11:04,047
Leonard could probably
kick your ass.

237
00:11:05,049 --> 00:11:06,004
Leonard?

238
00:11:06,629 --> 00:11:08,192
You're hanging out with Leonard?

239
00:11:08,574 --> 00:11:09,626
You know I hate him.

240
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,873
So? Everybody hates him.

241
00:11:11,874 --> 00:11:13,219
That's why he's cool.

242
00:11:14,188 --> 00:11:15,416
You people don't get it.

243
00:11:15,417 --> 00:11:17,670
Well, Pierce, I'm not
sure that I want to get it,

244
00:11:17,671 --> 00:11:19,085
and I think you ought
to take a break

245
00:11:19,086 --> 00:11:20,167
from these new friends of yours.

246
00:11:20,168 --> 00:11:21,719
They've got you all riled up.

247
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,174
That's what Leonard
said you'd say.

248
00:11:23,175 --> 00:11:25,894
Well, Leonard is not a
part of this study group,

249
00:11:25,895 --> 00:11:27,882
so you apologize right now to...

250
00:11:28,204 --> 00:11:29,410
what? Ah!

251
00:11:29,568 --> 00:11:30,758
I'm not your father!

252
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:32,033
I never said you were!

253
00:11:32,336 --> 00:11:34,127
- Where are you going?
- Out!

254
00:11:35,627 --> 00:11:37,772
When did Pierce become awesome?

255
00:11:37,773 --> 00:11:39,799
I am gonna shut you down,
you know that?

256
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,529
- I do.
- Oh! Oh, I get it!

257
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:42,659
I'm supposed to shut you down.

258
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,990
Well, I'm not gonna do it.
Don't.

259
00:11:43,991 --> 00:11:45,324
- I won't.
- Good.

260
00:11:45,325 --> 00:11:46,387
I am gonna shut you down.

261
00:11:46,388 --> 00:11:47,287
Good.

262
00:11:52,981 --> 00:11:54,363
You should have seen his face.

263
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,309
He was terrified.

264
00:11:56,745 --> 00:11:59,106
You're his worst nightmare now.

265
00:11:59,107 --> 00:12:00,899
You're old and you
don't give a damn.

266
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,906
Booyah!

267
00:12:09,893 --> 00:12:11,937
Don't make eye contact,
and we'll be fine.

268
00:12:14,188 --> 00:12:15,632
Mmm, here comes the boss!

269
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:19,272
- The dean has got a date.
- What a lovely couple.

270
00:12:19,273 --> 00:12:21,022
Please, give us a break,
will you?

271
00:12:21,023 --> 00:12:23,579
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh!

272
00:12:24,463 --> 00:12:26,599
I don't want to see you hipsters
when I come back out here!

273
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,406
Go! Run, run. We made them angry.

274
00:12:28,407 --> 00:12:30,973
We've made them angry.
Hey, he left his keys.

275
00:12:30,974 --> 00:12:33,137
Ooh, who's up for a joyride?

276
00:12:33,138 --> 00:12:35,410
- Hell yeah.
- Oh, I don't know.

277
00:12:35,411 --> 00:12:37,353
We could get into some
serious trouble here.

278
00:12:37,354 --> 00:12:38,303
Oh, come on.

279
00:12:38,304 --> 00:12:41,726
We get caught, we can just
pretend we're disoriented,

280
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:43,374
and he can give us a ride home.

281
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:46,957
Where am I? What year is it?

282
00:12:48,956 --> 00:12:50,257
But we've all been drinking.

283
00:12:50,258 --> 00:12:52,463
Oh, grow a schmekel.

284
00:12:55,266 --> 00:12:56,797
Okay, everyone,
this is the last scene.

285
00:12:56,893 --> 00:12:59,193
I want to thank you all for
contributing in your small way

286
00:12:59,194 --> 00:13:01,588
to the greatest film ever made.

287
00:13:01,589 --> 00:13:04,996
And on the seventh day,
Shirley shut down production.

288
00:13:04,997 --> 00:13:06,510
Abed, Shirley has informed me

289
00:13:06,511 --> 00:13:07,862
that you are using
school equipment

290
00:13:07,863 --> 00:13:10,530
on school property to
make a religious film.

291
00:13:10,531 --> 00:13:12,550
She has filed an
official complaint,

292
00:13:12,551 --> 00:13:14,996
invoking the separation
of church and state.

293
00:13:14,997 --> 00:13:16,963
I pointed out the
irony to her already.

294
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:18,646
Don't give a crap.
Let's be ironic.

295
00:13:18,647 --> 00:13:19,538
Shut it down. - Okay.

296
00:13:19,539 --> 00:13:22,485
Abed, are you making
a religious film?

297
00:13:22,865 --> 00:13:24,662
All movies are religious to me.

298
00:13:24,902 --> 00:13:28,252
Nice. But is it a
movie about Jesus?

299
00:13:28,253 --> 00:13:30,623
Is the matrix? Is Robocop?

300
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:32,428
Is superman returns?

301
00:13:32,618 --> 00:13:35,258
All stories are about
death and resurrection.

302
00:13:35,259 --> 00:13:37,332
I've got one.
Wrath of Khan, hmm?

303
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:38,124
That's a good one.

304
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,756
Spock sacrifices himself
for the crew and gets reborn.

305
00:13:40,757 --> 00:13:43,504
How captivating was
Ricardo Montalban in that?

306
00:13:43,505 --> 00:13:46,929
Except in Abed's film,
the character's name isn't Spock!

307
00:13:47,239 --> 00:13:50,035
That's true. It's Abed.

308
00:13:50,036 --> 00:13:53,374
Oh. I'm getting
creative goose bumps here.

309
00:13:53,386 --> 00:13:55,174
I love Charlie Kaufman.

310
00:13:55,175 --> 00:13:56,731
I need to run into
editing for one second,

311
00:13:56,732 --> 00:13:58,046
but if you want,
we can grab you a chair

312
00:13:58,047 --> 00:13:59,326
and you can watch a take.

313
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,130
I would love that.

314
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:03,953
I've never watched a take before.

315
00:14:03,954 --> 00:14:06,210
This is exciting. - Uh, you...

316
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:11,498
say what you will about Abed,
but the man cannot be killed.

317
00:14:13,451 --> 00:14:15,199
I mean, it's almost
like he's Jesus.

318
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,572
I got it.

319
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:18,657
I don't think we
should be driving.

320
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:21,877
I mean, we're all,
you know, old and groggy.

321
00:14:21,878 --> 00:14:23,908
God, stop worrying.

322
00:14:24,021 --> 00:14:26,253
Richard flew zeroes
during the big one.

323
00:14:27,101 --> 00:14:28,194
What do you mean, "flew zeroes"?

324
00:14:28,195 --> 00:14:29,238
He's not Japanese.

325
00:14:29,239 --> 00:14:31,722
Well, what did you fly
during the big one, rich?

326
00:14:32,141 --> 00:14:33,387
Where am I?

327
00:14:33,388 --> 00:14:34,942
Oh, come on.
Stop farting around.

328
00:14:34,943 --> 00:14:37,254
Seriously,
I don't know where I am.

329
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:39,228
What year is it?

330
00:14:41,016 --> 00:14:42,200
How do I drive?

331
00:14:59,362 --> 00:15:00,375
Let's bail.

332
00:15:00,793 --> 00:15:02,133
Wait a minute.
What about Richard?

333
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:04,567
Screw Richard!
It's every man for himself!

334
00:15:13,169 --> 00:15:14,526
Richard, are you all right?

335
00:15:14,993 --> 00:15:18,009
Well, am I Richard?

336
00:15:18,432 --> 00:15:19,253
Yes.

337
00:15:19,254 --> 00:15:20,438
Then I'm fine.

338
00:15:20,513 --> 00:15:23,029
But who were those
people that ran away?

339
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,282
Our friends?

340
00:15:25,227 --> 00:15:26,495
That's a good question.

341
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,599
Oh.

342
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:30,478
What is?

343
00:15:35,058 --> 00:15:37,826
There are no takes.
There is no viewer.

344
00:15:38,781 --> 00:15:41,552
The film is the story.
The story is us.

345
00:15:42,243 --> 00:15:44,295
We are the film.

346
00:15:46,093 --> 00:15:48,329
So, what do you think?

347
00:15:49,731 --> 00:15:50,890
I need to take a walk.

348
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:08,362
Dear God, my movie is
the worst piece of crap

349
00:16:08,363 --> 00:16:10,061
I have ever seen
in my entire life.

350
00:16:11,465 --> 00:16:12,931
How could I have been so blind?

351
00:16:13,616 --> 00:16:15,296
It's a self-indulgent,
adolescent mess.

352
00:16:15,297 --> 00:16:16,682
I can barely sit through it.

353
00:16:18,466 --> 00:16:19,363
And now, with all this hype,

354
00:16:19,364 --> 00:16:21,035
I've got a real snakes
on a plane brewing.

355
00:16:22,506 --> 00:16:23,647
The critics are gonna crucify me.

356
00:16:23,648 --> 00:16:25,602
My career will be
over before it begins.

357
00:16:26,859 --> 00:16:29,815
God, if you're out there,
I know I don't deserve it,

358
00:16:29,816 --> 00:16:31,135
but I need your help.

359
00:16:31,197 --> 00:16:32,942
Please take this
project away from me.

360
00:16:33,585 --> 00:16:36,061
Make it rain, send a meteor,

361
00:16:36,713 --> 00:16:39,038
anything. Please?

362
00:16:40,053 --> 00:16:41,222
Now?

363
00:16:45,828 --> 00:16:48,514
Okay, I get it.
This is what I deserve.

364
00:16:50,581 --> 00:16:51,845
I'll finish it up.

365
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:53,165
Hi, I'm Pierce Hawthorne's
emergency contact.

366
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:54,539
- You're here to pick him up?
- No, no.

367
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,956
I'm here to be removed
as his emergency contact.

368
00:17:57,171 --> 00:18:00,640
- One second.
- Hey, I got a class!

369
00:18:01,533 --> 00:18:02,630
Where is everybody?

370
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:04,374
Is anyone coming to get Leonard?

371
00:18:05,027 --> 00:18:07,511
No. Nobody comes
for him anymore.

372
00:18:07,745 --> 00:18:09,886
His kids asked us to
stop calling them.

373
00:18:11,199 --> 00:18:12,787
Why do you think
he acts like that?

374
00:18:18,173 --> 00:18:19,621
So we're in prison, right?

375
00:18:21,932 --> 00:18:23,080
All right, bring him out.

376
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:26,830
Over here, Pierce.
Come on. Book.

377
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:29,737
Hey.

378
00:18:29,738 --> 00:18:30,949
Go wait in the car.

379
00:18:31,586 --> 00:18:32,395
It wasn't my fault.

380
00:18:32,396 --> 00:18:34,945
Go. Wait. In. The. Car.

381
00:18:37,609 --> 00:18:38,596
Ooh!...

382
00:18:41,055 --> 00:18:42,514
you want me to
change that or not?

383
00:18:42,515 --> 00:18:43,684
I guess not.

384
00:18:44,411 --> 00:18:45,935
Uh, but, um,
could you do me a favor?

385
00:18:45,936 --> 00:18:48,810
Could you add Britta
Perry as a contact?

386
00:18:48,822 --> 00:18:50,461
P-e-r-r-y.

387
00:18:50,683 --> 00:18:52,517
And would you give her a call
a couple of times a week?

388
00:18:52,518 --> 00:18:54,079
She gets pretty worried about him.

389
00:18:54,655 --> 00:18:57,371
And, uh, she works days,
so make sure you call at night.

390
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,370
Everyone thinks what you
did was destined to happen,

391
00:19:18,122 --> 00:19:20,176
that it was proof that
God was making my movie,

392
00:19:20,269 --> 00:19:21,918
a movie so good,
it could never exist.

393
00:19:22,284 --> 00:19:24,301
They think I'm a genius,
and they think you're a villain.

394
00:19:27,987 --> 00:19:29,172
You heard me praying.

395
00:19:29,922 --> 00:19:31,388
I don't know what you mean.

396
00:19:32,618 --> 00:19:34,330
Oh, this is gonna be good!

397
00:19:34,331 --> 00:19:38,703
Abed sent me a new link, and that
man knows his video virality.

398
00:19:38,704 --> 00:19:42,438
So you're just gonna drop all
pretense of actually teaching us?

399
00:19:42,439 --> 00:19:44,091
Yeah. Here we go.

400
00:19:44,628 --> 00:19:47,352
Blessed be the peacemakers,
word to the meek,

401
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:50,326
the kingdom of heaven
is open all week.

402
00:19:50,327 --> 00:19:51,813
You finished my movie.

403
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,521
I don't know what you mean.

404
00:19:59,037 --> 00:20:00,059
You humble me.

405
00:20:01,168 --> 00:20:02,616
You humble me too.

406
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:14,729
Okay, open your books, because
Abed has broken the Internet.

407
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,930
 Great.

408
00:20:23,993 --> 00:20:28,294
So which one of us is gonna
head home and change?

409
00:20:31,614 --> 00:20:32,787
Hilarious.

410
00:20:32,788 --> 00:20:34,943
So you guys bought
one of my outfits

411
00:20:34,944 --> 00:20:38,929
and then staked out my apartment
every day until I wore it?

412
00:20:38,964 --> 00:20:40,457
That's not pathetic.

413
00:20:40,804 --> 00:20:41,702
Okay.

414
00:20:42,373 --> 00:20:43,257
Well.

415
00:20:43,774 --> 00:20:45,102
Good job.

416
00:20:45,425 --> 00:20:47,842
I guess I'm heading
home to change now.

417
00:20:49,322 --> 00:20:51,418
Oh, I hit traffic.
Did I miss it?

418
00:20:51,618 --> 00:21:01,818
