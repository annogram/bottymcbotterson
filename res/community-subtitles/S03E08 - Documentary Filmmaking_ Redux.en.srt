1
00:00:01,538 --> 00:00:03,120
Why did I come to Greendale?

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,163
So I can keep my job
and get busy with my education.

3
00:00:08,561 --> 00:00:10,066
To meet different people.

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:14,670
Because Greendale's
a slam dunk.

5
00:00:14,705 --> 00:00:16,038
- So why should you--
- Why should you--

6
00:00:16,073 --> 00:00:17,406
Why should you go Greendale?

7
00:00:17,441 --> 00:00:18,841
That's easy.

8
00:00:18,876 --> 00:00:21,010
Greendale has
the most advanced typing class

9
00:00:21,044 --> 00:00:22,578
in the southwestern
Greendale area.

10
00:00:22,613 --> 00:00:24,714
And now you can register
by fax.

11
00:00:24,748 --> 00:00:27,183
Go Greendale,
go Greendale, go!

12
00:00:27,217 --> 00:00:29,519
That, as you probably know,

13
00:00:29,553 --> 00:00:31,571
is the currently-running
commercial for our school.

14
00:00:31,605 --> 00:00:33,656
Yeah, I always see it
during late-night marathons

15
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:34,690
of <i>Fantasy Island.</i>

16
00:00:34,724 --> 00:00:36,025
That's not an accident.

17
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:38,027
It's the result
of intensive targeting.

18
00:00:38,061 --> 00:00:40,246
But now,
Greendale's School board

19
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,733
has given me a budget of
$2,000 to update our little ad.

20
00:00:44,751 --> 00:00:46,285
Are you sure it should change?

21
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:47,736
I chose Greendale
over city college

22
00:00:47,754 --> 00:00:49,505
because of the way
that one dude goes...

23
00:00:50,043 --> 00:00:51,693
Ah, okay, okay.

24
00:00:51,701 --> 00:00:54,053
You know I love to be seen
agreeing with you, Troy.

25
00:00:55,062 --> 00:00:56,745
But this is our chance to make

26
00:00:56,763 --> 00:00:59,148
Greendale's most reasonable
dreams come true.

27
00:00:59,183 --> 00:01:01,300
And I need your help--
All of you.

28
00:01:01,351 --> 00:01:03,636
That's okay, Jeffrey.

29
00:01:03,687 --> 00:01:04,954
You can say no.

30
00:01:04,988 --> 00:01:07,206
This school asks
very little of its students.

31
00:01:07,241 --> 00:01:08,558
It mainly gives.

32
00:01:08,592 --> 00:01:11,694
I feel like you guys might know
what I'm talking about.

33
00:01:12,996 --> 00:01:14,997
How can we help?

34
00:01:15,032 --> 00:01:16,616
Oh, thanks for asking.

35
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,318
I've chosen you,
Greendale's brightest,

36
00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:21,454
most coincidentally diverse,
hispanics not withstanding,

37
00:01:21,488 --> 00:01:24,507
study group to star
in our commercial.

38
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:26,042
- Ooh.
- Pick a character.

39
00:01:26,076 --> 00:01:27,543
We start this weekend.

40
00:01:27,578 --> 00:01:29,011
Oh, we get to be on tv!

41
00:01:29,046 --> 00:01:30,279
But if we're shooting
this weekend,

42
00:01:30,297 --> 00:01:31,664
why are these cameras here?

43
00:01:31,715 --> 00:01:34,834
Abed, true to form, has
decided to do the weird thing

44
00:01:34,885 --> 00:01:37,637
and film a documentary
instead of helping.

45
00:01:37,671 --> 00:01:39,121
As a student of character,
I have a feeling

46
00:01:39,156 --> 00:01:40,122
that trying to make
this commercial

47
00:01:40,157 --> 00:01:41,691
may cost the dean his sanity.

48
00:01:41,725 --> 00:01:44,060
And my camera follows
the fire, not the smoke.

49
00:01:44,094 --> 00:01:45,261
Ever seen <i>Hearts of Darkness?</i>

50
00:01:45,295 --> 00:01:46,729
Way better than <i>Apocalypse Now.</i>

51
00:01:46,763 --> 00:01:48,931
What's the catering sitch
going to be on this picture?

52
00:01:48,966 --> 00:01:50,032
This isn't Hollywood, Pierce.

53
00:01:50,067 --> 00:01:52,101
If it was, these glasses
would be tinted,

54
00:01:52,135 --> 00:01:53,135
and I'd be friends
with Stevie Nicks.

55
00:01:53,153 --> 00:01:54,520
No catering.

56
00:01:54,571 --> 00:01:55,905
This is outrageous.

57
00:01:55,939 --> 00:01:57,323
I'm not leaving my trailer
till there's food.

58
00:01:57,357 --> 00:01:58,908
You don't have a trailer.

59
00:01:58,942 --> 00:02:00,526
Well, then,
I'll rent a trailer.

60
00:02:00,577 --> 00:02:02,979
And I won't leave it till
I have the one I don't have.

61
00:02:03,013 --> 00:02:04,280
I'm an actor,
not a circus freak.

62
00:02:04,314 --> 00:02:05,748
Oh, no.

63
00:02:05,782 --> 00:02:07,833
I needed to go that way.

64
00:02:07,868 --> 00:02:09,986
Eh, I'll loop around.

72
00:02:36,847 --> 00:02:40,182
All right, let's rehearse
this mamajama.

73
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,535
Does everyone know
who they are?

74
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:43,920
Where's my script girl?

75
00:02:43,954 --> 00:02:45,371
It's supervisor,
and I'm right behind you.

76
00:02:45,405 --> 00:02:47,540
Thank you, supervisor girl.

77
00:02:47,574 --> 00:02:49,375
Faster than a locomotive.

78
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:51,077
A script supervisor
is the person

79
00:02:51,128 --> 00:02:52,695
that tells everyone
to stay on script

80
00:02:52,713 --> 00:02:56,165
and keeps careful notes to
prevent logical inconsistencies.

81
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:58,534
So... basically the star.

82
00:02:58,552 --> 00:03:00,803
We open on
a typical day at Greendale,

83
00:03:00,837 --> 00:03:02,271
only the students
all look happy

84
00:03:02,306 --> 00:03:03,973
and you can't smell that smell.

85
00:03:04,007 --> 00:03:05,257
Troy?

86
00:03:05,309 --> 00:03:06,876
"Why do I go Greendale?"

87
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,394
"With three kids at home,

88
00:03:08,428 --> 00:03:10,062
you better believe
every penny counts."

89
00:03:10,097 --> 00:03:12,014
"To meet different people."

90
00:03:12,048 --> 00:03:13,716
And then, you and Troy hug--

91
00:03:13,734 --> 00:03:15,601
if you're comfortable with that.

92
00:03:15,652 --> 00:03:17,052
- Of course.
- Yeah, Troy and I are buds.

93
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,071
Best buds. Air buds, even.

94
00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:24,744
Feeling stupid.

95
00:03:24,778 --> 00:03:27,747
And then, the camera pans,
and enter Dean Pelton.

96
00:03:27,781 --> 00:03:30,116
I got stuck with
the role of the dean.

97
00:03:30,167 --> 00:03:32,835
So I'm going to show him
how much of a dean I can be.

98
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:36,172
And I've got a feeling
I won't make the cut.

99
00:03:36,206 --> 00:03:37,573
Welcome to Dean-Dale

100
00:03:37,591 --> 00:03:38,624
community colle-dean.

101
00:03:38,675 --> 00:03:40,459
I'm a silly goose.

102
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:43,245
Honk, honk.
Dean-a-Lee-doo.

103
00:03:43,263 --> 00:03:44,263
- Look at me.
- Stop.

104
00:03:44,297 --> 00:03:46,081
This is my sister's outfit.

105
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:48,351
Jeffrey, stop.

106
00:03:48,385 --> 00:03:50,603
You've hit gold.
Save some for the screen.

107
00:03:50,637 --> 00:03:52,254
All right, people,
scene six is up first.

108
00:03:52,272 --> 00:03:53,990
Oh, and I don't think
Pierce is coming back.

109
00:03:54,024 --> 00:03:55,608
Can someone fill in
as the pencil?

110
00:03:55,642 --> 00:03:58,260
Pierce Hawthorne,
screen of stage and star,

111
00:03:58,295 --> 00:04:01,147
will not leave this trailer
until he gets a trailer.

112
00:04:01,198 --> 00:04:04,633
And then I'm not leaving that
trailer until there's catering.

113
00:04:04,668 --> 00:04:06,502
And I'm not eating
the food until--

114
00:04:06,536 --> 00:04:08,170
And action.

115
00:04:08,205 --> 00:04:10,039
Why go Greendale?

116
00:04:10,073 --> 00:04:14,143
Just because, just dean it!
Dean machine.

117
00:04:14,177 --> 00:04:15,294
Got dean, got much,
much got--

118
00:04:15,328 --> 00:04:17,046
And cut.

119
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,647
Oh, a star is born.

120
00:04:18,682 --> 00:04:20,983
I suggested to the dean
that we shoot my scenes

121
00:04:21,018 --> 00:04:23,019
in front of
the Luis Guzman statue

122
00:04:23,053 --> 00:04:24,670
because the dean
has no legal right

123
00:04:24,721 --> 00:04:26,722
to broadcast Guzman's image,

124
00:04:26,757 --> 00:04:29,125
which means every shot
will be unusable.

125
00:04:29,159 --> 00:04:31,427
I even put a call in to
Guzman's lawyers to alert them.

126
00:04:31,461 --> 00:04:33,429
I'm always willing
to go the extra mile

127
00:04:33,463 --> 00:04:34,797
to avoid doing something.

128
00:04:34,815 --> 00:04:36,232
Like sex with women.

129
00:04:36,266 --> 00:04:37,817
Shut up, Leonard,
you smell like mentholyptus.

130
00:04:37,851 --> 00:04:39,568
What are you even doing here?

131
00:04:39,603 --> 00:04:42,154
I'm thinking about
breaking into the tv game.

132
00:04:42,189 --> 00:04:44,824
Since it's apparently
sticking around.

133
00:04:44,858 --> 00:04:46,525
I don't want to wake up
in 30 years

134
00:04:46,576 --> 00:04:49,345
and wonder "what if?"

135
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:52,114
"Because this full-time mama
ain't breaking the bank

136
00:04:52,149 --> 00:04:53,949
with your expensive tuition."

137
00:04:53,984 --> 00:04:55,051
Okay, cut.

138
00:04:55,085 --> 00:04:56,752
Shirley, the voice.

139
00:04:56,787 --> 00:05:00,039
Can you make it, um--
I thought it would be more s--

140
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:04,360
What's another word that means
happy/threatening?

141
00:05:04,394 --> 00:05:06,429
The worde's looking for
is "sassy."

142
00:05:06,463 --> 00:05:08,431
He better pray
he don't find it.

143
00:05:09,499 --> 00:05:10,933
As soon as we get this shot,

144
00:05:10,967 --> 00:05:12,101
we are done.

145
00:05:12,135 --> 00:05:14,103
- Your phone is ringing.
- Oh.

146
00:05:14,137 --> 00:05:16,439
- Dean deaning.
- Dean Pelton?

147
00:05:16,473 --> 00:05:18,574
Hey, man, how you doing?
It's Luis Guzman.

148
00:05:18,608 --> 00:05:20,526
I hear you're making
a commercial for Greendale,

149
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,695
and you need permission
to use my face or something?

150
00:05:22,729 --> 00:05:26,398
Well, I, um...
Uh...

151
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,067
Well, why not
use the real thing?

152
00:05:28,118 --> 00:05:29,485
I'm sorry?

153
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:31,454
I'm saying, I'd love
to be in your commercial.

154
00:05:31,488 --> 00:05:33,956
Wowee!

155
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:37,860
A real big-time celebrity
wants to be in my commercial.

156
00:05:37,878 --> 00:05:39,862
Wowee.

157
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,231
A real big time celebrity
wants to be in my commercial.

158
00:05:42,265 --> 00:05:43,466
- Come on down.
- Yeah, that's cool.

159
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,134
But listen, I've got
to finish this movie,

160
00:05:45,168 --> 00:05:48,237
so, you know, I can't come for
a couple of weeks, all right?

161
00:05:48,271 --> 00:05:49,889
Mr. Guzman, Luis,
thank you.

162
00:05:49,923 --> 00:05:51,340
And can I just say,

163
00:05:51,374 --> 00:05:54,059
I loved you in--

164
00:05:54,094 --> 00:05:59,098
Innnnnnnn...

165
00:06:00,433 --> 00:06:02,434
IMDb.

166
00:06:02,486 --> 00:06:04,553
See you soon, man.

167
00:06:04,571 --> 00:06:07,055
That was tragic.

168
00:06:07,073 --> 00:06:09,825
The students here mean well,
they really do.

169
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,661
But what Greendale has
always needed is a miracle.

170
00:06:12,696 --> 00:06:14,780
This is it.

171
00:06:14,831 --> 00:06:16,866
This is how I get
to put Greendale on the map.

172
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,502
You know, I thought this
commercial was going to be okay.

173
00:06:19,536 --> 00:06:20,503
Well, guess what?

174
00:06:20,537 --> 00:06:22,454
It just officially
became great.

175
00:06:22,506 --> 00:06:24,123
Let me give you
a little rundown

176
00:06:24,174 --> 00:06:26,074
of this commercial's
great elements.

177
00:06:26,092 --> 00:06:30,112
Luis Guzman is in it.

178
00:06:32,649 --> 00:06:34,099
I'm sorry, will you excuse me?

179
00:06:34,134 --> 00:06:37,269
Everyone gather 'round,
quick announcement.

180
00:06:37,304 --> 00:06:38,988
Come on around.

181
00:06:39,022 --> 00:06:42,141
Everything that we shot so far
is worthless.

182
00:06:42,192 --> 00:06:43,425
I've thrown it out,

183
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,927
and we're starting over
tomorrow morning.

184
00:06:44,961 --> 00:06:46,662
- Why?
- Because...

185
00:06:46,696 --> 00:06:50,649
Luis Guzman
is in the commercial now, so...

186
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,434
Yeah. For realsies.

187
00:06:52,452 --> 00:06:56,872
Everyone, go home.
I'm rewriting all of your parts.

188
00:06:56,907 --> 00:06:58,874
Except for you, Jeffrey.

189
00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:01,276
You have locked
into something here.

190
00:07:01,294 --> 00:07:04,680
And the only thing
your character needs

191
00:07:04,714 --> 00:07:06,982
is more screen time.

192
00:07:07,017 --> 00:07:09,001
It's great that
he got a celebrity,

193
00:07:09,052 --> 00:07:11,086
- but why reshoot everything?
- Perfectionism.

194
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:12,621
The dean's first step
down a road

195
00:07:12,656 --> 00:07:14,256
that ends
in self-destruction.

196
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:16,510
That sounds...
Horrible.

197
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,261
Actually, I might end up
taking this to some festivals.

198
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:30,401
The dean's production has
taken over the entire school.

199
00:07:30,435 --> 00:07:31,499
Classes are shut down.

200
00:07:31,619 --> 00:07:33,308
The quilting club is being
forced to sew costumes.

201
00:07:33,428 --> 00:07:35,389
Two females, both 5'10",

202
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,336
one brunette, one with asthma.

203
00:07:37,945 --> 00:07:40,113
He's also using the P.A.
system for casting calls.

204
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,554
Okay, everyone--

205
00:07:41,588 --> 00:07:43,356
Does everyone have
their new script?

206
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:46,492
Uh, it says I'm supposed to be
a book reading a book.

207
00:07:46,526 --> 00:07:47,660
That--that doesn't
make sense.

208
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:54,150
What's this?

209
00:07:54,184 --> 00:07:56,135
Scene four.

210
00:07:56,153 --> 00:07:58,020
Last night, I had an epiphany.

211
00:07:58,071 --> 00:08:00,690
I'm ready to step
this mother up a notch.

212
00:08:00,741 --> 00:08:02,358
This commercial is going
to push every button,

213
00:08:02,409 --> 00:08:04,110
starting with the one
that is so hot,

214
00:08:04,144 --> 00:08:05,745
it will sizzle
your finger--

215
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:07,830
racccccce.

216
00:08:07,864 --> 00:08:09,548
And action.

217
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,984
"To meet
different people."

218
00:08:12,002 --> 00:08:14,370
Cut!
I'm coming in.

219
00:08:18,692 --> 00:08:22,545
I am trying to pull
a 400-year-old dagger

220
00:08:22,596 --> 00:08:27,833
out of this nation's heart,
and you two are hugging.

221
00:08:27,851 --> 00:08:29,885
Her, I understand, but you?

222
00:08:29,936 --> 00:08:31,053
What did I do?

223
00:08:31,104 --> 00:08:33,172
You didn't.
Let's take it again!

224
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:36,342
"To meet
different people."

225
00:08:36,376 --> 00:08:38,010
Again.

226
00:08:38,028 --> 00:08:40,196
"To meet
different people."

227
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,864
I need more!

228
00:08:41,898 --> 00:08:43,115
More!

229
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,700
Wrong!
Fight the power!

230
00:08:44,735 --> 00:08:46,235
Fight it with your hugs.

231
00:08:46,286 --> 00:08:48,621
Tear down those walls.

232
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,557
Okay, you get this wrong
one more time,

233
00:08:51,591 --> 00:08:54,026
I'm segregating the school.

234
00:08:54,044 --> 00:08:55,861
"To meet different people."

235
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:58,197
You can't even do it
when we're helping you!

236
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,900
Somebody help her!

237
00:09:00,934 --> 00:09:02,367
To meet different people!

238
00:09:02,385 --> 00:09:04,086
Stop saying I'm different!

239
00:09:04,137 --> 00:09:06,972
Dean, we've spent
12 hours on this scene.

240
00:09:07,007 --> 00:09:09,475
Maybe it's time
to move on to something else.

241
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:12,261
I'm in Psych 101, and even I
don't know what's happening.

242
00:09:12,312 --> 00:09:15,047
The dean is going insane
and taking all of you with him.

243
00:09:15,082 --> 00:09:18,050
If you know that,
then do something!

244
00:09:18,085 --> 00:09:20,786
I'm doing everything I can.
I only have so many cameras.

245
00:09:23,774 --> 00:09:25,224
- Oh!
- Aah!

246
00:09:25,242 --> 00:09:28,393
I've spent an entire day
in this thing for no reason.

247
00:09:28,411 --> 00:09:30,746
What if the shoot drags on
for another day?

248
00:09:30,781 --> 00:09:32,531
Or, God forbid, two.

249
00:09:35,235 --> 00:09:36,769
And action, and move.

250
00:09:36,803 --> 00:09:38,471
"This full-time mama
ain't breaking the bank--"

251
00:09:38,505 --> 00:09:40,039
Cut, cut, cut,
cut, cut, cut--Garrett,

252
00:09:40,073 --> 00:09:42,758
you're not taking advantage of
the motion capture technology.

253
00:09:42,793 --> 00:09:44,477
You have to move.

254
00:09:44,511 --> 00:09:45,778
I forgot what I am again.

255
00:09:45,812 --> 00:09:48,647
Oh, for crying out--
you are a microscope!

256
00:09:48,682 --> 00:09:50,616
No, that's a toilet.

257
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,918
No, that's clearly a frog
who can't get out of a box.

258
00:09:52,936 --> 00:09:55,104
Jeff thinks he has it bad?

259
00:09:55,138 --> 00:09:57,523
As Jeff's understudy,
I have to wear my Jeff wig

260
00:09:57,557 --> 00:10:00,626
on top of my Chang hair and
then my bald cap on top of that.

261
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,311
There's no air
getting through here.

262
00:10:02,362 --> 00:10:04,113
I'm literally dying.

263
00:10:04,147 --> 00:10:06,615
But you'll never hear my story.

264
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:09,034
I mean, now you heard it,
but... That was close.

265
00:10:09,069 --> 00:10:11,403
Are you sure you can't
work a little faster?

266
00:10:11,437 --> 00:10:12,771
Nobody asked for perfection.

267
00:10:12,789 --> 00:10:14,773
Well, perfection
is what you're getting.

268
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,441
And if you don't like it,
you can fire me.

269
00:10:16,459 --> 00:10:18,110
Yeah, if we don't like it,

270
00:10:18,128 --> 00:10:20,746
at this point,
we definitely will fire you.

271
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:24,283
Good.
That's how I like it. Ha!

272
00:10:24,301 --> 00:10:26,085
I'm surrounded by assassins.

273
00:10:26,119 --> 00:10:28,454
By own school's paper
has turned on me.

274
00:10:28,488 --> 00:10:29,955
But when this is all over,

275
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:32,291
I'll have a commercial
with Luis Guzman in it,

276
00:10:32,309 --> 00:10:35,728
and all they'll have are
their words and their fears

277
00:10:35,762 --> 00:10:37,146
and whatever
embarrassing photos

278
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,465
they can get from
my two-faced mother.

279
00:10:41,034 --> 00:10:42,468
Garrett, I've got
two men in diapers here.

280
00:10:42,502 --> 00:10:43,519
I know one of them is playing

281
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:45,070
the dawn of a new era
in education,

282
00:10:45,105 --> 00:10:46,322
but I've got nothing
on the other one.

283
00:10:46,356 --> 00:10:48,340
Oh, um,
just a guest of the dean's.

284
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,976
Well, both of you
go that way, then.

285
00:10:51,011 --> 00:10:52,995
The dean had
his seventh epiphany today,

286
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:54,780
which has given me
an epiphany of my own.

287
00:10:54,814 --> 00:10:56,649
The dean is a genius.

288
00:10:56,683 --> 00:10:58,200
He has to be.

289
00:10:58,251 --> 00:11:00,219
If he isn't, I've given
almost two weeks of my life

290
00:11:00,253 --> 00:11:02,171
to an idiot.
That is unacceptable.

291
00:11:02,205 --> 00:11:05,024
Therefore the dean is a genius.

292
00:11:05,058 --> 00:11:07,493
And I will die
protecting his vision.

293
00:11:07,527 --> 00:11:10,429
Are you by any chance familiar
with Stockholm Syndrome?

294
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,214
Is it something
that the dean created?

295
00:11:12,265 --> 00:11:13,682
Because if not, I don't care.

296
00:11:13,717 --> 00:11:16,302
We all wanna go,
but the dean won't let us.

297
00:11:16,336 --> 00:11:18,337
I think Pierce played this
the smartest from the beginning.

298
00:11:18,355 --> 00:11:20,105
He's probably at home
watching <i>Forensic Files</i>

299
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,540
and eating cheesy popcorn.

300
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,731
Well, about time.

301
00:11:28,782 --> 00:11:31,066
Hey, that's for Luis Guzman.

302
00:11:31,117 --> 00:11:35,404
Well, when you get me
my trailer, he can have it back.

303
00:11:35,455 --> 00:11:37,406
And make it
as nice as this one.

304
00:11:37,457 --> 00:11:39,825
Hey, Dean.
Dean? Hey, Dean!

305
00:11:39,859 --> 00:11:41,994
Pierce mistook me
for the dean today.

306
00:11:42,028 --> 00:11:45,564
- I want windows.
- How did that make you feel?

307
00:11:45,599 --> 00:11:47,566
I've become
a stranger to myself.

308
00:11:47,601 --> 00:11:51,220
I'm bald now.
I've always been bald.

309
00:11:51,254 --> 00:11:53,505
I merely dreamt of having hair.

310
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,841
And now the bald man is awake.

311
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,009
Jeff?

312
00:11:57,043 --> 00:11:58,928
It's time.

313
00:12:02,282 --> 00:12:06,018
Lights, camera, Dean.

314
00:12:06,052 --> 00:12:08,254
Action.

315
00:12:08,288 --> 00:12:11,690
Why go Greendale?
Just because!

316
00:12:11,724 --> 00:12:13,559
Cut.
Cut.

317
00:12:15,728 --> 00:12:17,196
Lose the bald cap.

318
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,565
- What?
- I don't like it.

319
00:12:19,599 --> 00:12:21,066
It's hokey, it's fake.

320
00:12:21,084 --> 00:12:23,735
Take it off.

321
00:12:25,872 --> 00:12:27,606
No.

322
00:12:29,309 --> 00:12:32,577
I beg your pardon, actor?

323
00:12:32,595 --> 00:12:36,882
I have worn this stupid thing
for 12 days.

324
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,300
I have made bald friends.

325
00:12:38,351 --> 00:12:40,185
Well, that's your mistake.

326
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,388
Because it's a lie.
It's Hollywood crap.

327
00:12:42,422 --> 00:12:44,773
And I won't allow it
in my commercial.

328
00:12:44,808 --> 00:12:47,559
You're not bald.

329
00:12:47,594 --> 00:12:49,761
Yes, I am.

330
00:12:49,779 --> 00:12:52,998
Well, then, you're wrong
for the part!

331
00:12:53,033 --> 00:12:55,951
Understudy!

332
00:13:00,123 --> 00:13:02,408
That's it.

333
00:13:02,442 --> 00:13:05,644
That's reality.

334
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:07,079
Winger, you're done.
Go home.

335
00:13:07,113 --> 00:13:08,881
Go home.

336
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:13,185
Okay, I don't know why,
but this is the last straw.

337
00:13:13,219 --> 00:13:14,837
As a licensed psychology major,

338
00:13:14,888 --> 00:13:18,590
I am declaring this production
a violation of human rights.

339
00:13:18,624 --> 00:13:21,860
You have made us prisoners
of your insanity.

340
00:13:21,895 --> 00:13:23,162
Shut your face, Britta.

341
00:13:23,196 --> 00:13:25,014
If the dean wants his role

342
00:13:25,065 --> 00:13:27,983
to be played by a Chinese man
in a blond wig--

343
00:13:28,018 --> 00:13:30,135
Oh, my God, you are insane.

344
00:13:30,153 --> 00:13:31,803
All right, I'm sick and tired

345
00:13:31,821 --> 00:13:32,988
of hearing complaints

346
00:13:33,023 --> 00:13:35,107
that I'm forcing people
to be here.

347
00:13:35,141 --> 00:13:39,712
Anyone who doesn't want
to help me can leave!

349
00:13:51,891 --> 00:13:54,676
- Abed, stop!
- Okay.

350
00:13:54,711 --> 00:13:56,541
Keep rolling.

351
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:11,066
Hello?
Hello.

352
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,451
Hello?

353
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:24,379
Hello, it's me.
Luis Guzman.

354
00:14:24,413 --> 00:14:26,247
- Hello!
- Hi.

355
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:30,602
Hi, Mr. Guzman,
Dean/Director Craig Pelton.

356
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:33,054
Sorry, I've been editing.

357
00:14:33,088 --> 00:14:34,305
It's a ltle bit of a mess.

358
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:38,092
What the --  is that?

359
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,761
Oh, that's a possum.

360
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,095
Once you spend
some time with them,

361
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:45,867
you see they're just like
big, gentle rats.

362
00:14:45,901 --> 00:14:48,203
- Who's the guy?
- I'm no one.

363
00:14:48,237 --> 00:14:50,321
That's Abed.
He's a little bit odd.

364
00:14:50,373 --> 00:14:52,774
Now, without further ado,

365
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:56,494
here is the commercial
you will be staring in.

366
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:00,665
Why do I go Greendale?

367
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:08,757
- Aah!
- What's in the box?

368
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,825
Ohh...Oh...

369
00:15:13,863 --> 00:15:15,764
I've got to make a phone call.

370
00:15:15,798 --> 00:15:18,850
I had to tell this dean
I couldn't do his commercial.

371
00:15:18,901 --> 00:15:20,902
He didn't take that
too well either.

372
00:15:20,936 --> 00:15:22,470
Y'all gotta help this dude.

373
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:23,822
I mean, aren't you his friends?

374
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:25,940
I'm more of a fly on the wall.

375
00:15:25,974 --> 00:15:27,826
What is go--

376
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,360
what?

377
00:15:29,412 --> 00:15:31,579
You won't be in my commercial,

378
00:15:31,614 --> 00:15:33,832
but you'll be in
his stupid documentary?

379
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:35,650
All he does
is follow people around.

380
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:37,619
Yeah, but haven't you seen
<i>Hearts of Darkness?</i>

381
00:15:37,653 --> 00:15:39,037
- Way better than--
- I want you

382
00:15:39,088 --> 00:15:41,423
the hell off of my campus,
you ungrateful backstabber.

383
00:15:41,457 --> 00:15:42,874
I already got rid
of your trailer.

384
00:15:42,925 --> 00:15:44,125
I had a trailer?

385
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:46,044
Can anyone hear me?

386
00:15:46,095 --> 00:15:48,379
I will walk off
this production.

387
00:15:48,431 --> 00:15:51,015
I will quit!
Hello?

388
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,017
I come here to shoot
this commercial for Greendale.

389
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:54,836
That's what you had
written on the script.

390
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:56,337
Ugh, that script was terrible.

391
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:57,388
I thought it was pretty good.

392
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,673
Of course you'd think that.

393
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,275
You went here.

394
00:16:03,446 --> 00:16:06,231
Oh, I get it.

395
00:16:06,282 --> 00:16:09,016
You're worse than crazy.

396
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:10,685
You're ashamed of your school.

397
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:13,187
And that--that statue
of me out there,

398
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:14,188
that's just wrong, man.

399
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:15,623
Well, the bronze
adds ten pounds.

400
00:16:15,658 --> 00:16:17,358
- Nah, man--
- It's not going to be perfect.

401
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,026
Screw you.

402
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:21,963
I'm just saying, don't worship
the people leaving Greendale.

403
00:16:21,997 --> 00:16:23,998
Worship the people
that are here.

404
00:16:24,032 --> 00:16:27,585
Worship this place.
It changes people's life.

405
00:16:27,636 --> 00:16:30,672
Look, I loved my time here.
I got laid like crazy.

406
00:16:30,706 --> 00:16:32,807
That's way before
<i>Boogie Nights</i> too.

407
00:16:32,842 --> 00:16:36,911
Look, this is a special school.

408
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:42,383
You don't deserve to be here.

409
00:16:49,057 --> 00:16:50,525
Are you still filming, Abed?

410
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:52,076
Yeah, but try not
to address me.

411
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:55,113
I'm not really here.

412
00:16:55,164 --> 00:16:57,582
Neither am I.

413
00:16:57,616 --> 00:17:01,736
I don't think I can finish
my commercial.

414
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:04,405
But I think I know
how your documentary ends.

415
00:17:08,511 --> 00:17:10,044
Hi, I'm Craig Pelton,

416
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:12,297
Dean of Greendale
Community College.

417
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:16,551
I have failed this school.

418
00:17:16,585 --> 00:17:18,303
I have failed it
because I thought

419
00:17:18,354 --> 00:17:20,722
I was better than Greendale.

420
00:17:20,756 --> 00:17:23,107
See, I went to a university,

421
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:26,311
so I thought it was my job
to improve this place.

422
00:17:26,362 --> 00:17:28,646
But it turns out that the only
thing wrong with Greendale

423
00:17:28,697 --> 00:17:30,899
is that it's run by
an insecure wreck

424
00:17:30,933 --> 00:17:33,968
who holds five dances
and two talent shows a year

425
00:17:34,003 --> 00:17:36,204
because he's afraid that
the school isn't good enough.

426
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:39,607
But Greendale is good enough

427
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,776
because it accepts me
for what I'm not.

428
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:44,979
Greendale is the best school
in the entire world,

429
00:17:45,014 --> 00:17:49,517
and I'm so sorry
what I've done to it.

430
00:17:49,552 --> 00:17:51,786
And I'm sorry what I've done
to the ice cream machine.

431
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:54,472
Aah!

432
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:59,327
Please, no one eat out of it
until you clean the nozzles.

433
00:17:59,361 --> 00:18:01,829
The janitor knows how.

434
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:04,632
I'm horrible.

435
00:18:05,734 --> 00:18:07,135
I'm horrible.

436
00:18:09,305 --> 00:18:11,272
Gentlemen, what I'm about
to show you

437
00:18:11,307 --> 00:18:13,775
is not the commercial
you paid me to create.

438
00:18:13,809 --> 00:18:15,026
What I am about to show you

439
00:18:15,077 --> 00:18:16,778
is a glimpse into
my mind and soul.

440
00:18:16,812 --> 00:18:18,780
Please hold your questions
until the end.

441
00:18:18,814 --> 00:18:20,481
I know you will have
a lot of them,

442
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:23,818
but I'll understand
if you'd rather I just leave.

443
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:29,791
Why do I go Greendale?

444
00:18:29,825 --> 00:18:31,709
The dean is a genius.

445
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,294
To meet different people.

446
00:18:33,328 --> 00:18:34,712
With three kids at home,

447
00:18:34,763 --> 00:18:36,831
you better believe
every penny counts.

448
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,634
I loved my time here.
I got laid like crazy.

449
00:18:39,668 --> 00:18:40,885
So why should you--

450
00:18:40,936 --> 00:18:42,053
Why should you--

451
00:18:42,104 --> 00:18:44,505
Why should you
go to Greendale?

452
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:48,059
Greendale is the best school
in the entire world.

453
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,746
Go Greendale,
go Greendale, go!

454
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:54,899
It's good.

455
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:55,984
Y-you know what,
better than good.

456
00:18:56,018 --> 00:18:57,201
Good enough.

457
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:59,821
Is there any more
of the crazy Chinese guy?

458
00:18:59,855 --> 00:19:01,322
He pops.

459
00:19:01,356 --> 00:19:03,207
I'm confused.
That's not my commercial.

460
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:04,742
I-I didn't make that.

461
00:19:04,793 --> 00:19:07,028
Yeah, yeah, okay, Zemeckis,
it moved through you.

462
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:09,197
Anyway, congratulations.

463
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,549
That should last us
another 16 years.

464
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,501
So, uh, what's next?

465
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:16,471
- Chump's rusty bucket?
- Quarter taps.

466
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,344
- Did you do this?
- You did mostly.

467
00:19:23,378 --> 00:19:25,179
You got the footage
you needed on the first day.

468
00:19:25,213 --> 00:19:29,851
I added a little bit of
my footage to fill in the gaps.

469
00:19:29,885 --> 00:19:32,420
I thought you were
a fly on the wall.

470
00:19:32,454 --> 00:19:34,422
Some flies are too awesome
for the wall.

471
00:19:34,456 --> 00:19:36,424
Documentarians are supposed
to be objective,

472
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:38,426
to avoid having
any effect on the story.

473
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,361
And yet we have more effect
than anyone.

474
00:19:40,396 --> 00:19:41,729
Because we decide to tell it.

475
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:43,114
And we decide how it ends.

476
00:19:43,165 --> 00:19:44,666
Will your story be
yet another sad one

477
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,701
of yet another man
who just wanted to be happy?

478
00:19:46,735 --> 00:19:49,671
Or will your story acknowledge
the very nature of stories

479
00:19:49,705 --> 00:19:51,706
and embrace the fact
that sharing the sad ones

480
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,074
can sometimes make them happy?

481
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:54,592
Ugh.

482
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:57,879
Before you say anything...

483
00:19:57,913 --> 00:19:59,263
Nope, I've got nothing.

484
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:01,182
Can you just forgive me?

485
00:20:05,921 --> 00:20:07,438
Yep.

486
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:09,757
Why?

487
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:12,643
Because we've all been there.

488
00:20:12,695 --> 00:20:14,779
Which is why we're all here.

489
00:20:19,368 --> 00:20:23,104
Aww!

490
00:20:23,122 --> 00:20:24,489
I'm a good Dean?

491
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,958
Yeah.

492
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:31,079
Can someone help me get
a live possum out of my office?

493
00:20:31,113 --> 00:20:32,246
We could do that.

494
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,299
It just keeps jumping
and skittering.

495
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:38,119
And you think you're prepared,
and then it skitters again.

496
00:20:39,955 --> 00:20:41,122
Okay, scene's over.

497
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,757
Hmm?

498
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:50,078

They'll be ready for you
in 20 minutes, Mr. Garland.

500
00:20:57,025 --> 00:20:57,995
Great.

501
00:20:58,115 --> 00:20:59,938
I'm a star!

502
00:20:59,972 --> 00:21:01,373
Give me that.

503
00:21:01,407 --> 00:21:04,242
I will not be mitigated.

504
00:21:09,254 --> 00:21:10,348
Okay, you know what?

505
00:21:10,383 --> 00:21:12,100
I'm not coming out of
this trailer

506
00:21:12,135 --> 00:21:14,419
until I get a new trailer.

507
00:21:17,133 --> 00:21:19,149
And get me
a granola bar!
