1
00:00:02,834 --> 00:00:04,436
Oh, what are you
guys doing together,

2
00:00:04,437 --> 00:00:05,958
Just the two of you?
We're gonna raise money

3
00:00:05,959 --> 00:00:07,552
On the quad to help
with the oil spill.

4
00:00:07,553 --> 00:00:10,481
We're making this display to
show how serious the problem is.

5
00:00:10,482 --> 00:00:12,703
Oh, yeah. Each drop represents

6
00:00:12,704 --> 00:00:15,458
10,000 gallons of oil.

7
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:18,851
Ooh! Oh...

8
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,843
I'm so glad this tragedy
overshadowed haiti.

9
00:00:20,844 --> 00:00:22,011
I didn't have any ideas for that.

10
00:00:22,012 --> 00:00:23,819
Yay to having fun in pairs!

11
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,445
What up, party people?

12
00:00:25,446 --> 00:00:26,956
Oh, you got a
band-aid on your arm.

13
00:00:26,957 --> 00:00:28,144
You should be more
careful shaving.

14
00:00:28,145 --> 00:00:30,739
I wax, dummy.
This is from a blood test.

15
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,382
Oh, no...I knew it.

16
00:00:32,383 --> 00:00:33,642
Things are going too well for you.

17
00:00:33,643 --> 00:00:35,560
Oh, no, no. Just a physical.

18
00:00:35,667 --> 00:00:37,558
Even a ferrari needs a tune-up.

19
00:00:38,015 --> 00:00:39,320
You guys moonshiners now?

20
00:00:39,321 --> 00:00:40,951
No, just the two of them.

21
00:00:40,952 --> 00:00:42,610
We're raising money
for the oil spill.

22
00:00:42,611 --> 00:00:43,917
Did you even know there was one?

23
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:46,296
Uh, yeah, I have the
aol home page bookmarked.

24
00:00:46,297 --> 00:00:47,786
Did you even know
about the ostrich

25
00:00:47,787 --> 00:00:49,249
That raised the tiger cub?

26
00:00:51,681 --> 00:00:54,185
- Troy, what's wrong?
- I just saw a dead body.

27
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:56,771
I told you not to use
the east stairwell.

28
00:00:56,772 --> 00:00:58,474
My pastor said it's meth season.

29
00:00:58,501 --> 00:01:00,400
You know I'm living
with Pierce now, so...

30
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:02,748
This morning I went to
do laundry in the garage,

31
00:01:02,749 --> 00:01:05,214
And I found his mom... dead.

32
00:01:05,215 --> 00:01:07,832
- oh!
- Troy, that's terrible!

33
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:10,276
Well, she had been in
bad shape for a while.

34
00:01:10,627 --> 00:01:13,340
So I guess she crawled out
there to die like a cat.

35
00:01:15,115 --> 00:01:16,982
I've never been that close
to a dead body before.

36
00:01:16,983 --> 00:01:18,577
- oh!
- Oh, pumpkin!

37
00:01:19,573 --> 00:01:21,441
She was so cold and gray.

38
00:01:22,473 --> 00:01:23,748
I saw her underwear!

39
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,074

40
00:01:33,818 --> 00:01:35,986
Jeez... who died?

41
00:01:35,987 --> 00:01:39,021
Pierce, we're so sorry
to hear about your mom.

42
00:01:39,022 --> 00:01:40,454
- why?
- Losing a loved one

43
00:01:40,455 --> 00:01:41,991
Is always difficult.

44
00:01:41,992 --> 00:01:44,277
What? My mom isn't dead.

45
00:01:44,278 --> 00:01:45,711
But when Troy found her,
he said that... 

46
00:01:45,712 --> 00:01:48,123
well, her heart, lungs,
kidneys, and brain

47
00:01:48,124 --> 00:01:49,211
Stopped working.

48
00:01:49,212 --> 00:01:51,694
And another way of
saying that would be...

49
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,343
she's used up her organic body.

50
00:01:53,344 --> 00:01:56,539
By...dying in it.

51
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,232
Wrong. She's alive.

52
00:02:00,233 --> 00:02:02,236
Mom was a part of
my buddhist church.

53
00:02:02,683 --> 00:02:05,020
She's a level five laser lotus,
same as me.

54
00:02:05,021 --> 00:02:07,291
When a level five's
body stops functioning,

55
00:02:07,292 --> 00:02:09,580
It's vaporized in the
temple of renewal

56
00:02:09,581 --> 00:02:11,991
And stored in an energon pod.

57
00:02:11,992 --> 00:02:14,642
In a few years,
when our technology advances,

58
00:02:14,643 --> 00:02:16,099
They'll extract her body vapors

59
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,894
And recondense it
to a solid state.

60
00:02:17,895 --> 00:02:18,959
And before you know it,

61
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,566
Mom'll be back in the kitchen
making Troy and me sandwiches.

62
00:02:23,767 --> 00:02:24,662
Ha.

63
00:02:27,365 --> 00:02:29,769
Pumpkin! It's okay!

64
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:35,914
Did you guys hear about
that turtle in china?

65
00:02:36,521 --> 00:02:38,125
Two packs a day.

66
00:02:39,144 --> 00:02:42,266
* give me some rope,
time in a tree

67
00:02:42,267 --> 00:02:45,462
Give me the hope
to run out of steam

68
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:48,860
Somebody said we could be here

69
00:02:48,921 --> 00:02:52,969
We could be roped up,
tied up, dead in a year

70
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:57,112
I can't count the
reasons I should stay

71
00:02:57,948 --> 00:03:02,472
One by one they all just fade away

72
00:03:02,893 --> 00:03:06,913
Sync by YYeTs.net

73
00:03:09,897 --> 00:03:11,615
look, if you guys just let
me get to the can opener,

74
00:03:11,616 --> 00:03:12,664
I can feed you.

75
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,993
We have to do
something about Pierce.

76
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:16,090
He really thinks
his mom isn't dead.

77
00:03:16,261 --> 00:03:18,012
He's gone crazy.

78
00:03:18,189 --> 00:03:19,043
-...er?

79
00:03:19,044 --> 00:03:21,296
He won't even let us
have a memorial service.

80
00:03:21,552 --> 00:03:23,149
I was halfway done
with the collage.

81
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,822
He hasn't cried yet,
and from what I've been told,

82
00:03:24,823 --> 00:03:27,279
That's not normal.
Who's normal, Abed?

83
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,299
Well, baptists are,
but that's beside the point.

84
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,635
Everybody has some sort of
service for the departed... 

85
00:03:31,636 --> 00:03:34,067
Eskimos, witch doctors,
jewish people.

86
00:03:34,068 --> 00:03:35,346
Oh, cool. We made the list.

87
00:03:35,347 --> 00:03:38,034
The point being,
death needs to be coped with,

88
00:03:38,035 --> 00:03:40,145
Not ignored, otherwise,
why did mankind

89
00:03:40,146 --> 00:03:41,830
Concoct all these religions?

90
00:03:41,831 --> 00:03:44,863
- you wanna rephrase that?
- Oh, I'm sorry... humankind.

91
00:03:44,864 --> 00:03:45,958
You think you're real smart,
don't you?

92
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,329
Guys, guys, guys.
Did we learn nothing

93
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:49,566
From last christmas?

94
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,873
I don't see much difference
between Pierce's religion

95
00:03:51,874 --> 00:03:53,029
And anybody else's.

96
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,027
Well, then you're not listening,

97
00:03:54,028 --> 00:03:55,582
Because his has lasers.

98
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:58,389
Look, you guys make fun of me
for not caring about religion,

99
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,782
But at least I'm dedicated
enough to not caring

100
00:04:00,783 --> 00:04:03,102
To let you have your own beliefs.

101
00:04:04,232 --> 00:04:05,604
Can't Pierce have his?

102
00:04:06,464 --> 00:04:07,926
Can't you be cool like me?

103
00:04:09,676 --> 00:04:10,497
Hello?

104
00:04:10,805 --> 00:04:12,915
He ends so many of
his speeches that way.

105
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:16,761
- morning, guys.
- Morning, Pierce.

106
00:04:17,077 --> 00:04:18,968
How's mom? - terrific.

107
00:04:18,969 --> 00:04:21,109
Her body's being
vaporized as we speak.

108
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,665
What does that feel like?

109
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:24,170
They say it's the
greatest feeling ever.

110
00:04:24,171 --> 00:04:27,375
Like the second when the fudge
on your sunday is still hot

111
00:04:27,376 --> 00:04:30,380
Or when you're the first one
to break in a new boob job.

112
00:04:30,381 --> 00:04:33,096
Also, you're free from the
burden of your earthly body.

113
00:04:33,097 --> 00:04:34,155
It is a burden.

114
00:04:34,156 --> 00:04:37,155
Greetings, class! I am dr.
Ian duncan.

115
00:04:37,156 --> 00:04:39,948
Now, I don't normally
teach anthropology,

116
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:43,283
But apparently professor bauer
tried to strangle mr. Winger

117
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:45,790
And has been put on
administrative leave with pay.

118
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:50,161
So...what is anthropology?

119
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,904
Seriously, does anyone know?

120
00:04:55,597 --> 00:04:58,573
- you, in the boobs.
- It's the study of humanity.

121
00:04:58,678 --> 00:04:59,606
Wow!

122
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:02,866
Wow. I thought
psychology was a racket.

123
00:05:03,847 --> 00:05:05,246
Well, well.

124
00:05:06,309 --> 00:05:08,645
I heard there was a drunk limey

125
00:05:08,646 --> 00:05:09,864
Teachin' this class.

126
00:05:09,865 --> 00:05:11,892
I'm not actually drunk,
and I can prove it.

127
00:05:11,893 --> 00:05:14,362
I blew beneath the legal
limit just this morning.

128
00:05:14,363 --> 00:05:15,404
That's reassuring.

129
00:05:15,405 --> 00:05:17,369
Also, I would like
everyone here to know

130
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:20,149
That this man assaulted
me last year.

131
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:22,121
And I have a restraining order

132
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:24,983
So I can have him expelled
if he comes within...

133
00:05:24,984 --> 00:05:26,562
25...

134
00:05:26,633 --> 00:05:27,675
feet.

135
00:05:28,467 --> 00:05:29,728
- Abed.
- Yep.

136
00:05:40,644 --> 00:05:42,756
Proceed, dr. Teeth.

137
00:05:43,055 --> 00:05:47,678
It is the single largest
disaster in recorded history.

138
00:05:47,679 --> 00:05:51,204
It is worse than 50
exxon valdez spills!

139
00:05:51,205 --> 00:05:52,980
You don't have to yell at us.

140
00:05:52,982 --> 00:05:55,654
Nobody is on the other
side of this issue.

141
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,216
And the pelicans
are covered in oil.

142
00:05:59,217 --> 00:06:01,803
Everyone likes pelicans.
They bring babies.

143
00:06:01,922 --> 00:06:04,140
- that's storks.
- Oh, right.

144
00:06:04,153 --> 00:06:06,533
Well...we still like them!

145
00:06:07,432 --> 00:06:08,691
Yeah, we do. Um...

146
00:06:09,012 --> 00:06:10,244
I'm gonna give you...

147
00:06:10,827 --> 00:06:12,713
Another 20. - oh!

148
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,947
Thank you so much!

149
00:06:18,188 --> 00:06:19,701
I'm here for my test results...

150
00:06:19,954 --> 00:06:21,674
If you haven't framed them yet.

151
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,850
- Hi, gorgeous.
- Jeff.

152
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:26,076
You have something
very infectious.

153
00:06:26,383 --> 00:06:27,838
What? - charm!

154
00:06:28,848 --> 00:06:30,138
You got me, jackie.

155
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:32,163
Seriously,
everything looks great.

156
00:06:32,164 --> 00:06:33,672
You're an incredible specimen.

157
00:06:33,673 --> 00:06:36,026
Even your moles look
like little hearts.

158
00:06:36,207 --> 00:06:37,471
The only thing I would suggest... 

159
00:06:37,472 --> 00:06:39,141
Go see a doctor and
get a prescription

160
00:06:39,142 --> 00:06:41,043
For cholesterol medication.

161
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,451
Your cholesterol's
a little high.

162
00:06:44,452 --> 00:06:46,563
It's no big deal.
Eat some egg whites.

163
00:06:46,564 --> 00:06:48,625
But I-I don't understand.

164
00:06:48,626 --> 00:06:51,382
Wait, did I accidentally
tell you you have aids?

165
00:06:51,383 --> 00:06:52,504
'cause I've done that before.

166
00:06:52,505 --> 00:06:53,605
- it doesn't... I mean-
- It doesn't... 

167
00:06:53,606 --> 00:06:55,235
I treat my body like a temple!

168
00:06:55,236 --> 00:06:57,282
Well, I can't be the
first person to tell you

169
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:59,355
That the temple
doesn't last forever.

170
00:06:59,407 --> 00:07:01,022
I mean, it's made of hamburger.

171
00:07:01,023 --> 00:07:03,291
This is a... this
is a temple of doom.

172
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,439
And you know what?
Like the real temple of doom,

173
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,435
It represents the
inconvenient fact

174
00:07:07,436 --> 00:07:08,720
That all good things... 

175
00:07:08,721 --> 00:07:11,338
Be they people or
movie franchises... 

176
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:14,446
Eventually collapse
into sagging, sloppy,

177
00:07:14,447 --> 00:07:16,948
Rotten piles of hard
to follow nonsense.

178
00:07:17,442 --> 00:07:18,651
I need to be alone.

179
00:07:21,217 --> 00:07:23,540
Uh...you can do that by leaving.

180
00:07:28,159 --> 00:07:29,539
Whoo. Okay.

181
00:07:29,681 --> 00:07:30,791
Let's get goin'!

182
00:07:30,976 --> 00:07:32,927
Those paps aren't gonna
smear themselves.

183
00:07:33,862 --> 00:07:37,742
There is no god!

184
00:07:37,994 --> 00:07:40,367
Tell us how you really feel.
Am I right?

185
00:07:48,662 --> 00:07:49,602
Morning, Jeff.

186
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:50,890
Did you get the results
of your blood test?

187
00:07:50,891 --> 00:07:52,908
- I'm fine.
- I figured.

188
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,541
Thank you for wising
us up yesterday.

189
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:57,867
We were being judgmental
about Pierce's religion.

190
00:07:57,868 --> 00:07:59,032
But the fact is, jesus... 

191
00:07:59,033 --> 00:08:01,131
the fact is, everyone's dying.

192
00:08:02,143 --> 00:08:03,452
And we all have
these little notions

193
00:08:03,453 --> 00:08:04,581
That we're the exception,

194
00:08:04,582 --> 00:08:06,654
But we're as wrong as we are dead.

195
00:08:10,867 --> 00:08:11,995
That's nice.

196
00:08:15,089 --> 00:08:16,958
How's it going with the
little side project

197
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,764
That just the two
of you are doing?

198
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:21,863
It's great. I made $236,

199
00:08:21,864 --> 00:08:23,038
Plus Britta's makes... 

200
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,383
Well, all totaled,
we're close to 250, right, Britta?

201
00:08:27,265 --> 00:08:29,084
Greendale cares
about this issue.

202
00:08:29,085 --> 00:08:30,749
Yeah. I don't think that's it.

203
00:08:30,838 --> 00:08:32,597
- what do you mean?
- Come on, annie.

204
00:08:32,598 --> 00:08:33,829
You know guys are giving you money

205
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:36,529
Because of the whole
sexy schoolgirl routine.

206
00:08:36,908 --> 00:08:38,848
- I have a routine?
- Yeah.

207
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:41,676
You know, the one where you
use posture as an excuse

208
00:08:41,677 --> 00:08:42,903
To stick out your chest

209
00:08:42,904 --> 00:08:45,169
And you laugh at
guys' unfunny jokes,

210
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46,298
Pretending not to know

211
00:08:46,299 --> 00:08:48,812
That they have a sock at
home with your name on it.

212
00:08:49,603 --> 00:08:52,297
Um...that's me,

213
00:08:52,631 --> 00:08:54,576
And if a guy wants to
make a puppet of me,

214
00:08:54,577 --> 00:08:56,124
That's hardly your concern.

215
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,991
Well, I just may
be an outsider here

216
00:08:57,992 --> 00:08:59,972
Because I was never
called to participate,

217
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:01,962
But it seems to me
that Britta's upset

218
00:09:01,963 --> 00:09:04,482
Because she's raising
less money than you.

219
00:09:04,483 --> 00:09:05,669
Yeah, I'm raising less money

220
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,260
Because I'm not
jump-starting date rapists.

221
00:09:09,973 --> 00:09:10,996
Bitter much?

222
00:09:10,997 --> 00:09:12,844
Say "Bitter much" Much?

223
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:16,558
Say say "Bitter much much" Much?

224
00:09:20,737 --> 00:09:23,145
It's not my fault.
I used to wear a back brace.

225
00:09:23,292 --> 00:09:24,282
That's why.

226
00:09:25,868 --> 00:09:27,274
What's with the lava lamp?

227
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,138
It's not a lava lamp.
It's my mom.

228
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:32,782
Ha ho ho! Snap!

229
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,172
Wait...what?

230
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:36,778
The temple finished
vaporizing her.

231
00:09:36,933 --> 00:09:38,813
This is mom's energon pod.

232
00:09:39,524 --> 00:09:41,411
And that's her vapor in
those little bubbles.

233
00:09:41,412 --> 00:09:43,131
I'm sure that thing
was free, right?

234
00:09:43,132 --> 00:09:45,240
Energon doesn't
grow on trees, Jeff.

235
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:48,275
It's harvested by super bees
in a buddhist meteor crater.

236
00:09:48,276 --> 00:09:49,898
Which is at the
foot of mount sky mall

237
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:51,498
In the sharper image valley?

238
00:09:52,226 --> 00:09:53,850
Sorry, I overslept.

239
00:09:53,851 --> 00:09:56,630
The sidewalk is more
comfortable than it looks.

240
00:09:56,631 --> 00:09:58,762
Drunk. Glug, glug, glug.

241
00:09:58,763 --> 00:10:01,252
Shut up. So where did
we get to yesterday?

242
00:10:01,253 --> 00:10:02,661
You are drunk and stupid.

243
00:10:02,662 --> 00:10:05,067
Actually, ben, I do have
a wee big of a headache,

244
00:10:05,068 --> 00:10:06,294
So if you could just... 

245
00:10:11,735 --> 00:10:13,790
Isn't that interesting?

246
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:15,491
I have a right to be here, sir.

247
00:10:15,513 --> 00:10:16,770
Oh, you do, you do,

248
00:10:16,771 --> 00:10:20,384
And I do hope you have
very good hearing.

249
00:10:22,234 --> 00:10:23,347
Bastard!

250
00:10:25,243 --> 00:10:27,480
So, where did we
get to yesterday?

251
00:10:27,481 --> 00:10:29,176
We were talking about humanity,

252
00:10:29,177 --> 00:10:32,872
Which starts with birth
and ends with death.

253
00:10:32,873 --> 00:10:33,734
True.

254
00:10:33,735 --> 00:10:36,409
All life ends in death,
which we, as a species,

255
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:39,547
Are cursed with knowing,
resulting in...

256
00:10:40,929 --> 00:10:43,193
Something.

257
00:10:43,808 --> 00:10:46,638
Again, this is
really not my field.

258
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:48,479
Professor, what would you say

259
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,184
Might be the difference between

260
00:10:50,185 --> 00:10:52,826
A religion and...A cult?

261
00:10:52,827 --> 00:10:55,037
Why don't we open that
question to the floor,

262
00:10:55,038 --> 00:10:56,081
Since I don't know

263
00:10:56,082 --> 00:10:58,051
And the book for this
class is expensive?

264
00:10:58,052 --> 00:11:00,720
Well, I would say a cult might,
for instance,

265
00:11:00,721 --> 00:11:03,228
Sell you a tube of jell-o

266
00:11:03,415 --> 00:11:06,196
And tell you your mother is in it.

267
00:11:06,197 --> 00:11:08,517
- Jeffrey!
- I see... are we thinly veiling

268
00:11:08,518 --> 00:11:10,487
A personal conflict and
passing it off as a lesson?

269
00:11:10,488 --> 00:11:12,127
'cause if so, please continue.

270
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,216
Reformed neo-buddhism
is not a cult!

271
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:17,244
It is a new way of
looking at the world,

272
00:11:17,245 --> 00:11:18,884
Emphasizing empowerment.

273
00:11:19,076 --> 00:11:21,255
- like a video game?
- Yes, Troy.

274
00:11:21,256 --> 00:11:22,656
Very much like a video game.

275
00:11:22,738 --> 00:11:24,768
You gain levels,
and at a certain point,

276
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:27,310
You actually can eat a ghost.

277
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:29,184
What? I wanna eat a ghost!

278
00:11:29,185 --> 00:11:31,525
No. No, do not let
him pollute your brain

279
00:11:31,526 --> 00:11:32,635
With this crap, Troy.

280
00:11:32,636 --> 00:11:35,533
- it's okay to ask questions.
- I have a question.

281
00:11:35,534 --> 00:11:37,739
You said your mother went
from a solid to a vapor.

282
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,674
Do people in your religion
ever take liquid form,

283
00:11:39,675 --> 00:11:40,687
Like the creatures in the abyss

284
00:11:40,688 --> 00:11:41,837
Or children's tylenol?

285
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:43,330
That's a good question.

286
00:11:43,331 --> 00:11:45,895
Actually, when buddha returns,

287
00:11:45,896 --> 00:11:47,400
We all take liquid form

288
00:11:47,401 --> 00:11:50,913
And merge into a shimmering
ocean of knowledge.

289
00:11:51,342 --> 00:11:54,473
Which, according to scripture,
tastes like hawaiian punch.

290
00:11:54,474 --> 00:11:56,691
I do like hawaiian punch.

291
00:11:56,692 --> 00:11:57,705
Hey, if you're really curious,

292
00:11:57,706 --> 00:11:59,861
Come to my church's
open hive tomorrow.

293
00:11:59,862 --> 00:12:02,981
You know, wine, beer,
free credit checks.

294
00:12:02,982 --> 00:12:04,571
How much wine and
beer per person?

295
00:12:04,572 --> 00:12:06,581
- oh, come on!
- We're having a con... what?

296
00:12:06,582 --> 00:12:09,099
Excuse me.
Is this anesthesiology?

297
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,742
Yes. Yes, it is.

298
00:12:11,743 --> 00:12:12,912
Just go with this.

299
00:12:13,038 --> 00:12:15,643
It's really sad. Anything helps.

300
00:12:15,644 --> 00:12:17,640
So just anything you
could give would be... 

301
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:24,150
hey!

302
00:12:24,151 --> 00:12:27,138
I like need you to
save the pelicans.

303
00:12:27,139 --> 00:12:29,590
They're all feathery and pelicany.

304
00:12:29,591 --> 00:12:31,478
I wuv them.

305
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:34,679
Thank you!

306
00:12:36,628 --> 00:12:39,381
Wow. It really is
easy to raise money

307
00:12:39,382 --> 00:12:40,942
When you sell out your gender.

308
00:12:42,112 --> 00:12:43,409
I'm sure it's even easier

309
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:45,263
When you're not
standing next to this.

310
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,593
Hey, jerk! You're stupid!

311
00:12:47,594 --> 00:12:49,230
Gimme money. I know more than you.

312
00:12:49,231 --> 00:12:51,200
Oh, I don't know anything.

313
00:12:51,201 --> 00:12:52,856
I need boys.

314
00:12:52,857 --> 00:12:55,311
Saving the planet
makes my back hurt.

315
00:12:55,312 --> 00:12:57,354
Oh, I obviously don't
need guys for anything.

316
00:12:57,355 --> 00:13:00,041
That's why I wear stripper
boots during the day

317
00:13:00,042 --> 00:13:02,181
And eat only celery
and mustard for lunch!

318
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:05,154
- oh, I never stop smiling.
- I never start!

319
00:13:05,155 --> 00:13:07,090
My sweaters keep shrinking!

320
00:13:07,091 --> 00:13:10,872
I get up an hour early to
ever-so-slightly curl my hair.

321
00:13:16,341 --> 00:13:18,449
Yeah, you're both so different.

322
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:19,740
Skinny bitches.

323
00:13:19,761 --> 00:13:21,680
Hello, billionaire boys club.

324
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,584
Mind if I ask what
happened in class today?

325
00:13:24,585 --> 00:13:27,283
You pulled 40 minutes of
anesthesiology out of your ass.

326
00:13:27,284 --> 00:13:28,452
Yeah, I did.

327
00:13:28,735 --> 00:13:31,172
But, uh, I meant
your elderly friend.

328
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:35,828
Do you know how many times
I haven't eaten a donut?

329
00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:37,567
- I do not.
- How much I got teased

330
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:40,134
In grade school for dabbing
my pizza with napkins?

331
00:13:40,699 --> 00:13:41,723
I've suffered.

332
00:13:42,127 --> 00:13:43,828
I've denied myself. - mm-hmm.

333
00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:46,064
Because the rules
said if I did that,

334
00:13:46,065 --> 00:13:47,543
I would live longer.

335
00:13:47,544 --> 00:13:49,562
But then, halfway
through the game,

336
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:53,090
I get this little update that
it doesn't matter what I do.

337
00:13:53,156 --> 00:13:54,765
I could eat powdered
bran every day

338
00:13:54,766 --> 00:13:56,239
While you suck down figgy pudding,

339
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,267
And I still might die first.

340
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,692
It's unfair!
I want my donuts back.

341
00:14:01,836 --> 00:14:05,350
Well, I think you're being
a little childish, and... 

342
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:08,133
Hold on a sec.
I need to use my force field

343
00:14:08,134 --> 00:14:09,744
To prevent chang
from getting food.

344
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:42,339
Where were we? Look...

345
00:14:42,379 --> 00:14:45,158
The way I see it, while
claiming to have no religion,

346
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:47,897
You were actually devoutly
worshipping yourself.

347
00:14:47,898 --> 00:14:50,499
And now that your god
has high cholesterol,

348
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,185
You're trying to kick
Pierce's in the balls.

349
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:56,909
You're right.

350
00:14:57,005 --> 00:15:00,323
All I've been trying to
do is crush Pierce's faith

351
00:15:00,324 --> 00:15:01,938
To feel better about dying.

352
00:15:01,939 --> 00:15:02,866
And...

353
00:15:02,928 --> 00:15:04,886
and now that I realize
that that was my goal...

354
00:15:04,887 --> 00:15:05,756
mm-hmm?

355
00:15:06,263 --> 00:15:08,567
I can really roll up my sleeves

356
00:15:08,568 --> 00:15:09,530
And get it done.

357
00:15:09,531 --> 00:15:10,809
- there it is.
- Thank you!

358
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:11,794
You're welcome.

359
00:15:12,323 --> 00:15:15,495
No, that wasn't what I-
actually, I don't care.

360
00:15:18,199 --> 00:15:19,983
He girls,
guess who found buddha.

361
00:15:19,984 --> 00:15:21,011
- hey.
- Hi.

362
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:24,047
We're on our way to
Pierce's buddhist open hive.

363
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,082
But first I'm taking these
fellows for ice cream

364
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,792
As an apology for
questioning Pierce's faith.

365
00:15:28,837 --> 00:15:31,531
Pierce says there's this
69th flavor I need to try.

366
00:15:31,532 --> 00:15:32,818
I am excited.

367
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,495
Hey, guys, my car's over there.

368
00:15:34,739 --> 00:15:35,539
Cool.

369
00:15:36,404 --> 00:15:37,284
Guess what.

370
00:15:37,766 --> 00:15:39,504
I'm not actually taking
them for ice cream.

371
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:41,648
I am taking them to
the county morgue

372
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,870
Where I have confirmed
that Pierce's mother's

373
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,698
Very un-vaporized corpse

374
00:15:45,699 --> 00:15:48,079
Will be lying on a
stainless steel slab

375
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,233
For all to see.

376
00:15:49,234 --> 00:15:51,804
Surprise! Welcome to reality.

377
00:15:51,805 --> 00:15:53,048
Welcome to death.

378
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,482
- have fun.
- Good luck.

379
00:15:54,925 --> 00:15:55,904
Wow.

380
00:15:56,181 --> 00:15:57,760
You guys are real downers.

381
00:15:57,795 --> 00:15:59,414
I can't believe I made
out with both of you.

382
00:15:59,932 --> 00:16:00,838
Ugh.

383
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,421
I'll check the basket.

384
00:16:04,142 --> 00:16:05,245
Sorry.

385
00:16:05,246 --> 00:16:07,029
I almost arched my back a little.

386
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,346
I know you hate that.

387
00:16:08,347 --> 00:16:10,980
No, I should count it.
Since I'm a calculating bitch.

388
00:16:10,981 --> 00:16:12,536
No, I should, since I'm the one

389
00:16:12,537 --> 00:16:14,219
Who's whoring out our gender!

390
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,978
Give that back to me.
I'm gonna count it!

391
00:16:15,979 --> 00:16:17,758
Let go! - gimme that!

392
00:16:25,633 --> 00:16:27,190
Oh, yeah? Think this is funny?

393
00:16:27,191 --> 00:16:29,194
You think it's funny?
Get off of me!

394
00:16:29,195 --> 00:16:31,696
You little brat! - oh!

395
00:16:33,831 --> 00:16:34,863
I hate you!

396
00:16:35,581 --> 00:16:38,208
Now, this is why
I came to america.

397
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,276
Maybe we should
listen to some music.

398
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:42,551
No problem.

399
00:16:42,678 --> 00:16:44,661
I brought the jam book
from the Pierce mobile.

400
00:16:44,662 --> 00:16:46,035
I could play some
of the old stuff,

401
00:16:46,036 --> 00:16:47,575
But you guys would make fun of me.

402
00:16:48,613 --> 00:16:49,393
So...

403
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:53,036
I'll throw ya...A bone
and put in some loggins.

404
00:16:53,037 --> 00:16:54,740
This ice cream place is far.

405
00:16:54,804 --> 00:16:56,800
Trust me. It's worth it.

406
00:16:57,957 --> 00:16:59,030
What's this?

407
00:16:59,031 --> 00:17:00,535
This is mom's handwriting.

408
00:17:00,734 --> 00:17:03,001
Is that what you were
doing in the garage,

409
00:17:03,002 --> 00:17:04,121
You silly goose?

410
00:17:04,122 --> 00:17:08,579
She spent her last
moments alive making a cd?

411
00:17:09,204 --> 00:17:10,975
That's gangster!

412
00:17:11,247 --> 00:17:14,282
Pierce, you found the CD,

413
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,697
Which means...i'm dead.

414
00:17:16,698 --> 00:17:17,424
Vaporized.

415
00:17:17,425 --> 00:17:20,903
I'm not vaporized.
I'm gone, Pierce.

416
00:17:21,284 --> 00:17:23,057
Gone forever and...

417
00:17:23,811 --> 00:17:25,679
That's how I like it.

418
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:30,781
Life is only worth a
damn because it's short.

419
00:17:31,225 --> 00:17:34,685
It's designed to
be consumed, used,

420
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:38,146
spent, lived, felt.

421
00:17:38,147 --> 00:17:40,658
We're supposed to fill
it with every mistake

422
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:43,244
And miracle we can manage.

423
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:46,489
And then we're supposed to let go.

424
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:50,730
I can't force you to do
that for yourself, Pierce.

425
00:17:51,077 --> 00:17:54,364
But you can't force me to stay.

426
00:17:54,653 --> 00:17:58,096
And if you unscrew the
top of that stupid thing,

427
00:17:58,097 --> 00:18:00,628
You'll see it was made in china.

428
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:02,401
I love you, son.

429
00:18:03,275 --> 00:18:04,410
Good-bye.

430
00:18:05,499 --> 00:18:07,489
I'll play myself out.

431
00:18:16,106 --> 00:18:17,095
Whew.

432
00:18:17,217 --> 00:18:18,596
Well, that proves one thing.

433
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:21,890
That woman was really
losing her marbles

434
00:18:21,948 --> 00:18:23,100
Toward the end.

435
00:18:28,287 --> 00:18:31,475
You...seriously still
think she's in there?

436
00:18:31,476 --> 00:18:32,569
Why wouldn't I?

437
00:18:36,336 --> 00:18:37,359
No reason.

438
00:18:41,489 --> 00:18:43,641
So...where's this
ice cream place?

439
00:18:43,642 --> 00:18:45,806
- yeah.
- Oh...um...

440
00:18:45,998 --> 00:18:48,267
You know, the... I think I...

441
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:49,986
Actually saw a better
one back there.

442
00:18:49,987 --> 00:18:53,665
The place I was gonna take you was...
kinda depressing.

443
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:59,029
Oh, can we get a little more
sawdust on that storm gutter?

444
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,071
Thank you!

445
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,419
I'm sorry... - I'm sorry too.

446
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,110
I just got jealous of you.

447
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,242
No, but you totally called
me on what I was doing,

448
00:19:08,243 --> 00:19:10,475
And... I only kissed Jeff

449
00:19:10,476 --> 00:19:11,765
Because I wanted to
see if I could do it

450
00:19:11,766 --> 00:19:13,983
Because I wanna be
cool and sexy like you.

451
00:19:13,984 --> 00:19:15,464
I can't believe how gross I am.

452
00:19:15,465 --> 00:19:17,917
I only slept with Jeff
because I hate myself,

453
00:19:17,918 --> 00:19:20,029
And that's why I got after
you for raising money.

454
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,513
I'm twice as gross.

455
00:19:21,514 --> 00:19:23,585
And you know the reason

456
00:19:23,586 --> 00:19:26,605
That we raised more money in
five minutes of oil wrestling

457
00:19:26,606 --> 00:19:28,473
Than we did in two
days of fundraising?

458
00:19:28,474 --> 00:19:30,586
Because... men are even grosser?

459
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:33,394
And when we forget that,
they win.

460
00:19:37,598 --> 00:19:38,775
Yeah. All right.

461
00:19:38,776 --> 00:19:40,008
All right, all right.

462
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,860
Yeah, do it.

463
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:43,902
Oh, so you got actual ice cream.

464
00:19:43,903 --> 00:19:46,124
Yeah. With peanut
butter and hot fudge.

465
00:19:46,404 --> 00:19:49,108
What the hell,
right? Nobody lives forever.

466
00:19:49,707 --> 00:19:50,718
No offense.

467
00:19:50,841 --> 00:19:53,080
Nah, think what you want.
It's a free country.

468
00:19:53,534 --> 00:19:55,376
I barely saw you this week, Abed.

469
00:19:55,377 --> 00:19:56,622
What have you been up to?

470
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,843
- not much.
- Hmm.

471
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:00,801
What?

472
00:20:00,802 --> 00:20:02,773
Whoa! Busted! 25 feet!

473
00:20:02,774 --> 00:20:04,997
Which puts you in violation

474
00:20:04,998 --> 00:20:07,971
Of this restraining order
I filed against you

475
00:20:07,972 --> 00:20:10,926
For abusing me with
your restraining order!

476
00:20:13,371 --> 00:20:16,057
Mutually assured destruction.

477
00:20:17,471 --> 00:20:19,426
Well played, Chang.

478
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,441
Thank you.

479
00:20:20,606 --> 00:20:21,506
Uh...

480
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:24,270
That means a lot.

481
00:20:24,271 --> 00:20:25,750
Do you mind getting
a quick photo of me
