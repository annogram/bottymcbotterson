1
00:00:01,519 --> 00:00:04,077
<i>It's Valentine's week,</i>

2
00:00:04,078 --> 00:00:07,912
<i>when the Greendale Human Being
is the Cupid Being,</i>

3
00:00:08,115 --> 00:00:11,107
<i>delivering your gift
to that special someone.</i>

4
00:00:11,318 --> 00:00:14,651
<i>But remember, Cupid's face
is magic marker on nylon,</i>

5
00:00:14,855 --> 00:00:19,349
<i>so love is not only blind but also
dizzy and a little belligerent.</i>

6
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:22,021
I'm chaperoning tomorrow's dance.

7
00:00:22,229 --> 00:00:24,322
You should come.
Maybe your study buds will go.

8
00:00:24,531 --> 00:00:27,022
What's the blonde's name?
Bitter, Butter, Beetlejuice?

9
00:00:27,234 --> 00:00:30,203
Britta. Yeah, she says Valentine's
Day ritualizes a connection

10
00:00:30,404 --> 00:00:33,896
between affection and candy so girls
can learn the ropes of prostitution.

11
00:00:34,108 --> 00:00:35,405
Translation, no date.

12
00:00:35,609 --> 00:00:37,543
I'm gonna join you at that dance.

13
00:00:37,745 --> 00:00:40,942
But as a novice boyfriend, could I
get a map of the minefield known as

14
00:00:41,148 --> 00:00:43,207
women's Valentine expectations?

15
00:00:43,417 --> 00:00:46,511
Every day of the year, I want
you to do what makes you happy.

16
00:00:47,321 --> 00:00:49,186
Tomorrow, I'm gonna be
happy spending the night

17
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:50,652
with an insatiable
statistics professor.

18
00:00:56,962 --> 00:00:58,589
<i>Jeff, it's the Registrar's Office.</i>

19
00:00:58,797 --> 00:01:01,994
<i>Seems you were wrong about paying
tuition with airline miles.</i>

20
00:01:02,201 --> 00:01:03,190
<i>We're gonna need a check...</i>

21
00:01:03,402 --> 00:01:04,391
<i>Message deleted.</i>

22
00:01:04,603 --> 00:01:08,471
<i>Jeff Winger, I am calling you.</i>

23
00:01:11,243 --> 00:01:14,007
<i>You're probably, whatever.</i>

24
00:01:14,213 --> 00:01:17,478
<i>So, what's up? Heh.</i>

25
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,714
Oh, it's the Cupid Being.
Ooh!

26
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,478
Now it has arrows. That's safe.

27
00:01:23,012 --> 00:01:26,470
Oh! It's from that cook with the
long beard in the cafeteria.

28
00:01:26,581 --> 00:01:27,570
I guess when he said,

29
00:01:27,782 --> 00:01:29,010
"I'm gonna get you,"

30
00:01:29,217 --> 00:01:30,945
um, he meant chocolates.

31
00:01:32,635 --> 00:01:35,627
A flower from Vaughn.
He's away on a vision quest.

32
00:01:36,831 --> 00:01:38,025
You got something, Abed?

33
00:01:38,232 --> 00:01:40,029
Another muffin basket
from another actress

34
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:42,634
who wants to be in my next film.
Does that work?

35
00:01:42,837 --> 00:01:45,101
Yep. Meryl Streep has two Oscars
because of her baking.

36
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:47,035
Oh, that's sarcasm
but I forgot to inflect.

37
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:48,708
This sounds
way more like sarcasm.

38
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:51,002
Inflection is so interesting.

39
00:01:51,212 --> 00:01:53,203
That big bag at the bottom.
Is that for me?

40
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:57,980
Anything in there for Troy?
Troy Barnes.

41
00:01:58,185 --> 00:01:59,709
Barnes, comma, Troy?

44
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:07,520
The birth of St. Valentine's.
Oh, good.

45
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:10,026
Now it has arrows. That's safe.

46
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:12,358
Sorry I'm late.
It's okay.

47
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:14,932
Actually, you look very early.
Oh, God, I'm really late.

48
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:16,899
Yes, you are.
Yeah. See you later.

49
00:02:17,104 --> 00:02:19,072
That's all right. We'll see you guys.

50
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:23,437
Can I get you something?
Water? Smelling salts?

51
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,669
An alibi for Cobain's suicide?

52
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,405
No, but you could help yourself
to a shorter forehead,

53
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:31,141
a non-Keebler nose,
and shutting up.

54
00:02:31,352 --> 00:02:33,650
Hmm. That stings.
I mean, not the words.

55
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:36,618
The clouds of bourbon vapor
forming them.

56
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:40,089
Heh. A girlfriend from
my anarchist days was in town

57
00:02:40,294 --> 00:02:42,694
and we drank. Everything.

58
00:02:42,897 --> 00:02:45,866
Yeah. And then you said,
"I should call Jeff."

59
00:02:46,067 --> 00:02:50,470
Yeah, because the first thing I do
when I'm having fun is think about...

60
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:55,131
<i>Jeff Winger, I am calling you.</i>

61
00:02:55,343 --> 00:02:58,107
<i>You're probably, whatever.</i>

62
00:02:58,312 --> 00:03:00,177
<i>So, what's up?</i>

63
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:01,609
The drunk dial.

64
00:03:01,816 --> 00:03:04,444
So much subtext.
So much intrigue.

65
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:08,452
So much of what the kids
are calling BCI.

66
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:11,750
That's, uh,
Booty Call Implication.

67
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:19,523
Oh...

68
00:03:19,834 --> 00:03:21,995
What happened to Britta?
Justice.

69
00:03:22,203 --> 00:03:26,139
Having spent the year denying her
attraction to me just to be alternative,

70
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:31,972
Britta called me at 3 a.m.
just to ask, "What's up?"

71
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:34,170
A drunk dial? Was it BCI?

72
00:03:34,382 --> 00:03:36,610
Booty call with a capital B.

73
00:03:36,611 --> 00:03:38,321
Mm. This can't be good.
It's no biggie.

74
00:03:38,322 --> 00:03:39,584
We give each other crap
all the time.

75
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:42,987
Well, that's the point. What crap can
she give now that you hold the cards?

76
00:03:43,193 --> 00:03:45,991
You shifted the balance like in a sitcom
when one character sees another one naked.

77
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,357
Is that really a sitcom staple?

78
00:03:48,565 --> 00:03:52,092
No. I have no idea what I'm talking about.
I'm Abed, I never watch TV.

79
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:05,908
Now, we all know that in English, the
rooster says "cock-a-doodle-doo."

80
00:04:06,116 --> 00:04:09,608
<i>In español, the gallo says:</i>

81
00:04:15,327 --> 00:04:16,988
What? I'm teaching.

82
00:04:23,115 --> 00:04:25,413
Aha! I knew you were holding back.

83
00:04:25,618 --> 00:04:28,382
Oh! It's from the girl I'm dating.

84
00:04:28,588 --> 00:04:30,078
Yeah, I met her in biology.

85
00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:32,814
She was looking for geology
and misread the sign.

86
00:04:33,025 --> 00:04:35,721
Yeah, I said, "We do not study
countries in here." Heh.

87
00:04:35,928 --> 00:04:39,295
Yeah, she's...
She's dumb, but... But sweet.

88
00:04:39,498 --> 00:04:42,592
Yeah, mine's from Danielle.
She's, uh... Uh...

89
00:04:42,802 --> 00:04:45,066
A lovely lady
in my marketing class.

90
00:04:45,605 --> 00:04:46,936
We're sleeping together.

91
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:49,505
They sound like very lucky ladies.

92
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:51,108
Yeah, they're not made up.

93
00:04:51,344 --> 00:04:53,778
Beep-beep! Oh, my God,
what's going on? Beep-beep-beep!

94
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,210
My bull crap meter's going crazy.

95
00:04:56,415 --> 00:04:59,384
Beep-beep-beep-beep-beep!
Beep-beep-beep-beep-beep!

96
00:05:00,853 --> 00:05:02,980
It's these presents
you've obviously sent yourselves

97
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:05,214
to make it look like
you have girlfriends.

98
00:05:05,424 --> 00:05:06,686
That's ridiculous.

99
00:05:06,893 --> 00:05:10,590
This is obviously your handwriting,
Mr. Tremor.

100
00:05:11,464 --> 00:05:13,022
And yours is signed, "Love, Troy"?

101
00:05:13,532 --> 00:05:16,467
I tell you, this is the most pathetic
thing I've ever seen in the classroom.

102
00:05:21,275 --> 00:05:23,675
Look at him over there,
cutting the gristle off his steak

103
00:05:23,878 --> 00:05:27,075
as ruthlessly as he cut off
Troy and Pierce's dignity.

104
00:05:27,648 --> 00:05:29,912
Ew! Now he's eating the gristle.

105
00:05:30,117 --> 00:05:32,779
I'm so sick of Chang.
Always tearing people down,

106
00:05:32,987 --> 00:05:34,852
making them feel horrible
about themselves.

107
00:05:35,076 --> 00:05:37,943
Somebody needs to humiliate him
the way he humiliated our boys.

108
00:05:38,146 --> 00:05:40,808
Mustache, get me a juice box.

109
00:05:41,015 --> 00:05:43,916
Now.
And that somebody is us.

110
00:05:46,621 --> 00:05:49,522
You can vomit onto this food
because it already smells like it.

111
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:53,216
Heh-heh. Yeah, totally.
Heh-heh-heh.

112
00:05:55,127 --> 00:05:57,527
My law firm went on a retreat
to Disney World once,

113
00:05:57,729 --> 00:06:02,666
and I got so drunk that I got into
a fight with animatronic Ben Franklin.

114
00:06:02,868 --> 00:06:04,199
Why are you telling me this?

115
00:06:04,403 --> 00:06:06,337
Well, the point is
that when I'm sober,

116
00:06:06,538 --> 00:06:09,439
I don't secretly hate Ben Franklin
or even think about him,

117
00:06:09,641 --> 00:06:11,472
so you drunk dialing me?

118
00:06:11,676 --> 00:06:14,804
It's not like a big deal.
My God. You're pitying me now.

119
00:06:15,013 --> 00:06:18,540
Well, you're acting really weird.
I'll talk to you in class, okay?

120
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,513
Just leave me alone till then.

121
00:06:23,924 --> 00:06:25,789
Beep-beep-beep!

122
00:06:25,993 --> 00:06:27,858
What is going on here?

123
00:06:28,062 --> 00:06:30,895
Beep-beep-beep-beep-beep!

124
00:06:31,098 --> 00:06:32,690
My doody meter's going crazy.

125
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,334
Okay, cut, cut, cut.
Leo, I'm not feeling it.

126
00:06:35,536 --> 00:06:37,629
I really need to believe that you're
holding an imaginary doody meter.

127
00:06:37,838 --> 00:06:41,365
The problem is not me.
It's you and your stupid script.

128
00:06:41,575 --> 00:06:42,940
Idiot.

129
00:06:43,144 --> 00:06:44,543
That's the anger. Use it.

130
00:06:45,813 --> 00:06:47,405
Wow.
One Papa John's commercial

131
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:48,604
and he thinks he's Christian Bale.

132
00:06:48,816 --> 00:06:50,443
Look, uh, you were right.

133
00:06:50,651 --> 00:06:53,484
Britta is totally weird around me.
It does feel like I saw her naked.

134
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:55,333
It's a resonant premise.
Tony even saw Angela naked

135
00:06:55,539 --> 00:06:57,006
<i>on the opening credits
of Who's the Boss?</i>

136
00:06:57,207 --> 00:06:58,902
And did Tony do
something to fix that?

137
00:06:59,109 --> 00:07:01,077
I don't know. I could never
get past the opening credits.

138
00:07:01,278 --> 00:07:03,143
<i>But when Chandler
saw Rachel naked on Friends,</i>

139
00:07:03,347 --> 00:07:05,042
to even the score Rachel needed
to see Chandler's penis.

140
00:07:05,549 --> 00:07:08,211
All right. I'll show Britta my penis.

141
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,102
Jeff, please don't waste my time.
I lose my Chang to Cub Scouts in 20 minutes.

142
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:14,643
So... So, what? To even the score,
I have to drunk dial her?

143
00:07:14,847 --> 00:07:17,645
Isn't that absurdly simplistic?
Would it even work?

144
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,548
Yes, and maybe. Oh.

145
00:07:19,549 --> 00:07:23,007
No room for error.
She'd have to believe it was real.

146
00:07:23,219 --> 00:07:24,662
Have you ever acted drunk before?

147
00:07:24,664 --> 00:07:26,295
I can totally do it.

148
00:07:26,296 --> 00:07:30,027
I'm fine. I can drive.
I can totally drive right now.

149
00:07:30,233 --> 00:07:31,757
Give me my keys.
That's enough.

150
00:07:31,968 --> 00:07:33,990
No, hold on a second.
All right.

151
00:07:33,322 --> 00:07:35,313
I don't care.

152
00:07:36,014 --> 00:07:37,641
No, seriously, give me my keys.

153
00:07:38,984 --> 00:07:40,474
Okay, that's a wrap, people.

154
00:07:41,602 --> 00:07:44,727
I want you to be at my
place at 4 so we can work on this.

155
00:07:44,728 --> 00:07:47,242
Well, no, I can't do that.
Here's why.

156
00:07:47,243 --> 00:07:48,676
Dumbest idea ever.

157
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:51,131
Jeff, you know Britta's defining weakness.
She cuts and runs.

158
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:54,102
Do this half-assed and fail, she
may leave, then we all lose her.

159
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:56,105
That's not gonna happen.
Not on my watch.

160
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,743
That's a deal breaker. Saddle up.

161
00:07:57,945 --> 00:08:00,413
Sorry I lost my cool.
Just quit smoking.

162
00:08:01,048 --> 00:08:04,415
<i>Kid's gonna be a star. He's a young
"the Asian guy from Lost."</i>

163
00:08:06,451 --> 00:08:07,509
Try it again.

164
00:08:08,253 --> 00:08:10,881
Come on. You're a big guy.

165
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:14,891
Action.

166
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,692
Hey, Britta.
Your call got me thinking,

167
00:08:20,693 --> 00:08:22,296
and thinking got me drinking.

168
00:08:22,297 --> 00:08:23,594
Stop. That was terrible.

169
00:08:23,799 --> 00:08:25,289
What?
Mm-mm.

170
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,401
You know, I can get drunk alone
if that's what helps people act.

171
00:08:28,603 --> 00:08:31,299
Well, that's your problem, Jeff.
You've been acting your whole life. Okay?

172
00:08:31,506 --> 00:08:34,066
Time to pass that act up
and find the actor playing you.

173
00:08:34,276 --> 00:08:36,710
Oh, they are gonna love you
in California.

174
00:08:39,681 --> 00:08:40,670
Do you like Britta?

175
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,544
Sure, who doesn't?
Over half the people that meet her.

176
00:08:44,986 --> 00:08:47,011
They can be put off
by her vacuous mannequin face,

177
00:08:47,222 --> 00:08:49,383
and her Jodie Foster severity.

178
00:08:49,825 --> 00:08:50,814
But you're different.
Uh...

179
00:08:51,026 --> 00:08:53,153
You know.
She's no barrel of monkeys.

180
00:08:53,361 --> 00:08:55,989
She... She wants everyone to be
honest but she lies to herself.

181
00:08:56,198 --> 00:08:58,189
She's seen the world
but doesn't get it.

182
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,527
She has more fights about stuff
that doesn't matter

183
00:09:00,735 --> 00:09:02,430
than a YouTube comment section.

184
00:09:02,637 --> 00:09:07,841
She's passionate, which I
find stupid but entertaining.

185
00:09:07,842 --> 00:09:09,135
Attractive?

186
00:09:09,136 --> 00:09:10,125
It was only attraction at first

187
00:09:10,338 --> 00:09:11,862
because she bothered to play
hard to get.

188
00:09:12,972 --> 00:09:16,387
- I'm happy with Michelle.
- Yeah, Slater is low maintenance.

189
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:17,211
The lowest.

190
00:09:17,212 --> 00:09:20,012
Britta, irritating, impossible, unpredictable,
and she didn't like you,

191
00:09:20,088 --> 00:09:21,464
so it felt useless to like her.

192
00:09:21,465 --> 00:09:25,333
Slater likes you how you are, expects nothing
from you. You're safe from change.

193
00:09:25,535 --> 00:09:27,093
And passion.

194
00:09:27,304 --> 00:09:28,703
Watch it.
Watch what?

195
00:09:28,905 --> 00:09:32,671
A phony drunk-dial soaked in phony
pity that insults Britta even more?

196
00:09:32,876 --> 00:09:35,868
Or a believable performance
informed by feeling?

197
00:09:38,115 --> 00:09:41,414
You know, I am sure
you're a good director,

198
00:09:41,618 --> 00:09:43,449
but you are a horrible
drinking buddy.

199
00:09:43,653 --> 00:09:46,053
I mean, I can't feel things
with you studying me

200
00:09:46,256 --> 00:09:48,247
like a beige praying mantis.

201
00:09:49,693 --> 00:09:51,092
You're right.

202
00:09:56,533 --> 00:09:59,991
I thought you never drank.
Scorsese drank with De Niro.

203
00:10:03,573 --> 00:10:06,440
It's not for me.
It's for the audience.

204
00:10:57,426 --> 00:10:59,394
All right, class, turn to page...
Whoa.

205
00:10:59,595 --> 00:11:02,189
Looks like the law firm
of Seacrest and Slumdog

206
00:11:02,397 --> 00:11:05,093
is taking the day off.

207
00:11:06,912 --> 00:11:09,671
Ooh. Another special delivery

208
00:11:09,672 --> 00:11:12,732
from Troy and Pierce's
imaginary lovers?

209
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:18,635
Wait a minute. Uhn.

210
00:11:18,841 --> 00:11:21,435
That one's for me. Heh-heh-heh.

211
00:11:21,643 --> 00:11:24,737
All right. Oh, yeah. Huh. Chh-chh.

212
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,646
Wow. It's from Princeton.

213
00:11:29,852 --> 00:11:32,047
They want to make me
associate professor

214
00:11:32,254 --> 00:11:34,882
of the Spanish Department?

215
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:37,888
They're telling me
I can name my price? Oh, my God.

216
00:11:38,427 --> 00:11:40,395
At Princeton? Come on.

217
00:11:40,596 --> 00:11:44,157
You two idiots really thought
I'd fall for this, huh?

218
00:11:44,366 --> 00:11:49,326
This is your pathetic attempt
to punish me for humiliating you.

219
00:11:49,694 --> 00:11:52,492
But we didn't do it.
Save it.

220
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:59,402
As punishment, because you two
obviously don't have any girlfriends,

221
00:11:59,604 --> 00:12:03,973
escort me to the Valentine's Dance
wearing elegant ladies' pantsuits.

222
00:12:04,175 --> 00:12:05,870
Ha-ha-ha. Yeah, right.

223
00:12:06,965 --> 00:12:08,227
You'll do it or you fail my class.

224
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:11,103
You can't do that.
Have you met me?

225
00:12:11,312 --> 00:12:14,645
I mean it.
Tonight, you are my bitches.

226
00:12:20,488 --> 00:12:22,615
Holy crap.

227
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,088
Abed.

228
00:12:26,494 --> 00:12:28,257
Abed?

229
00:12:39,674 --> 00:12:41,039
It's 3:00.

230
00:12:41,242 --> 00:12:42,903
What happened?

231
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,442
The last thing I remember

232
00:12:46,147 --> 00:12:49,139
is you were dancing
like that girl in the movie

233
00:12:50,918 --> 00:12:52,852
<i>Kids In Detention?
Breakfast Club?</i>

234
00:12:53,054 --> 00:12:55,818
Dear God.
What have you done to me?

235
00:12:56,023 --> 00:12:59,117
Wait, did I call Britta?

236
00:13:00,161 --> 00:13:02,994
Where's my phone?
Got it.

237
00:13:03,831 --> 00:13:05,492
You made two outgoing calls.

238
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,066
One to Britta, one to your girlfriend.

239
00:13:08,269 --> 00:13:09,896
I don't remember either of them.

240
00:13:10,104 --> 00:13:11,093
Neither do I.

241
00:13:12,707 --> 00:13:15,767
<i>And I don't remember the name
of the girl in The Breakfast Club.</i>

242
00:13:16,143 --> 00:13:17,735
Mary.

243
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:19,874
Margaret.

244
00:13:20,281 --> 00:13:22,306
Molly Ringworm?

245
00:13:23,484 --> 00:13:24,508
You broke me.

246
00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:32,629
I still can't believe I'm a size 14.

247
00:13:32,838 --> 00:13:36,501
I know the 12 was a little tight
but I could have pulled it off.

248
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:38,842
You guys really going through
with this?

249
00:13:39,044 --> 00:13:40,944
We have to. He'll fail us.

250
00:13:41,147 --> 00:13:43,672
But we're gonna find out who wrote
that letter. We have leads.

251
00:13:43,883 --> 00:13:46,909
Yeah. It was written on fake Princeton letterhead.
So whoever wrote it,

252
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:49,280
worked at Princeton,
ran out of stationary,

253
00:13:49,488 --> 00:13:51,046
and didn't have time
to go to the store.

254
00:13:51,257 --> 00:13:53,589
Um, you guys?
Uh-uh! Uh.

255
00:13:54,193 --> 00:13:55,217
What?

256
00:13:57,029 --> 00:13:58,519
Women's sizes run slimmer.

257
00:13:58,731 --> 00:14:01,291
I'm sure you're a 12 everywhere
that it counts.

258
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,730
Well, I'll take every little victory
I can get right now.

259
00:14:06,736 --> 00:14:09,422
You look about ready
to marry Courtney Love.

260
00:14:11,046 --> 00:14:13,014
That's the reverse of my zinger
from before.

261
00:14:13,215 --> 00:14:16,844
Okay, please stop shouting, all right?
I feel like that person in that TV show.

262
00:14:17,686 --> 00:14:19,711
Do you remember calling me
last night?

263
00:14:20,822 --> 00:14:22,346
Yeah. Why?

264
00:14:22,757 --> 00:14:24,816
Are we cool?
Oh, yeah.

265
00:14:25,026 --> 00:14:28,052
Have a seat, Drunky Brewster.
Let's study.

266
00:14:29,197 --> 00:14:31,131
Hey, balance restored, I guess.

267
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,233
Movie reference.

268
00:14:50,051 --> 00:14:51,678
Hey there.

269
00:14:52,087 --> 00:14:54,146
Happy Valentine's Day.

270
00:14:54,356 --> 00:14:56,586
I've been calling you.
Yeah, I know.

271
00:14:56,791 --> 00:15:00,727
I figured I'd just let it go to voicemail
in case you had the wrong number again.

272
00:15:01,162 --> 00:15:02,595
Elaborate?
Oh, you don't remember

273
00:15:02,797 --> 00:15:03,889
calling me at 4 in the morning

274
00:15:04,099 --> 00:15:07,032
and hanging up
when you realized I wasn't Britta?

275
00:15:07,033 --> 00:15:08,433
I guess not.

276
00:15:10,669 --> 00:15:12,159
Michelle.

277
00:15:12,371 --> 00:15:13,929
Michelle, um,

278
00:15:14,773 --> 00:15:18,504
I was trying to call Britain
to order you toffees.

279
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,007
Now that might sound dumb,

280
00:15:20,212 --> 00:15:24,512
but I needed to open with it
to make the truth less ridiculous.

281
00:15:28,153 --> 00:15:30,917
Two nights ago,
Britta drunk-dialed me,

282
00:15:31,123 --> 00:15:33,387
and it embarrassed her
and made her sad,

283
00:15:33,592 --> 00:15:35,958
and the only way for her
to get her power back

284
00:15:36,161 --> 00:15:38,755
was for me to get believably drunk
and leave her

285
00:15:38,964 --> 00:15:40,625
an equally
embarrassing message.

286
00:15:40,832 --> 00:15:42,993
It sure seems like you and Britta
are friends

287
00:15:43,201 --> 00:15:45,902
the way my mom's pool cleaner
was my uncle.

288
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,700
Have you had sex with her?
Not even a little.

289
00:15:48,001 --> 00:15:50,465
What doesn't make sense is
that you did all this work

290
00:15:50,466 --> 00:15:53,196
to put a smile on her face
but can't pick up ice cream

291
00:15:53,402 --> 00:15:55,893
<i>for Law and Order night
because it feels too marriage-y.</i>

292
00:15:56,138 --> 00:15:57,469
First of all, Chubby Hubby?

293
00:15:57,673 --> 00:15:59,300
I mean, could you pick
a scarier flavor?

294
00:16:00,455 --> 00:16:05,449
Let's talk about this later.
I need to chaperone something.

295
00:16:27,055 --> 00:16:29,649
There he is. Oh.

296
00:16:30,091 --> 00:16:33,356
You know, I thought I'd be embarrassed.
Now I'm just scared.

297
00:16:33,561 --> 00:16:36,689
I am seriously reconsidering how
much I want this language credit.

298
00:16:36,898 --> 00:16:37,922
Remember what we said?

299
00:16:39,334 --> 00:16:41,302
Never let him see us cry.

300
00:16:41,503 --> 00:16:42,731
Right.

301
00:16:42,937 --> 00:16:45,838
Okay, one, two...

302
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,668
Wait.
Keep your coats on.

303
00:16:47,876 --> 00:16:49,673
We're the ones that sent
the letter to Chang.

304
00:16:49,878 --> 00:16:51,209
What?

305
00:16:51,413 --> 00:16:52,675
You work...
You work at Princeton?

306
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:54,781
We were mad at him
for humiliating you.

307
00:16:54,983 --> 00:16:58,976
Well, nice fix, Tweedledum
and even Tweedlerdum.

308
00:16:59,187 --> 00:17:02,714
Look, we're gonna tell Chang
the truth,

309
00:17:03,158 --> 00:17:05,183
and we'll pay the price.

310
00:17:05,393 --> 00:17:06,792
Wait.

311
00:17:07,162 --> 00:17:09,392
We can't make you do that.
No, he's right.

312
00:17:09,597 --> 00:17:12,623
First we gotta get out of these
pantsuits then you can put them on.

313
00:17:12,834 --> 00:17:16,133
Look, Pierce, this whole thing started
because you and I were ashamed

314
00:17:16,337 --> 00:17:18,362
we didn't have ladies
that cared about us.

315
00:17:18,573 --> 00:17:20,871
And the good news is
we obviously do.

316
00:17:21,376 --> 00:17:26,609
The bad news is that it makes it our
manly duty to protect them tonight.

317
00:17:26,815 --> 00:17:28,077
Oh!
That's nice

318
00:17:28,283 --> 00:17:30,308
but we really can't let you do that.

319
00:17:30,518 --> 00:17:33,043
No, he's right. He's right.

320
00:17:33,254 --> 00:17:35,779
Step aside.
Oh.

321
00:17:36,891 --> 00:17:39,223
Let's handle this like men.
Yeah.

322
00:17:44,466 --> 00:17:46,024
Whoo. Ladies.

323
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:49,365
They're going to be okay, right?
Get in my Mercedes.

324
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,628
Just look away, baby.

325
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,037
Just look away.

326
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:17,291
Whoa.
Looking for someone?

327
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:19,960
Yeah.

328
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:22,027
Slater.
Heh.

329
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:23,800
Very funny.

330
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:27,330
You know, when you called me last
night and invited me to the dance,

331
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,474
I was shocked.

332
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:31,541
And thrilled.

333
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:35,213
Are you okay?

334
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:37,948
Yeah.

335
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:39,140
No. No.

336
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:41,912
Look, I'm sorry.

337
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:47,011
Uh, I don't... I don't remember asking you to the dance.
I don't remember anything.

338
00:18:47,012 --> 00:18:49,606
And now Slater knows about
all the drunk-dialing stuff,

339
00:18:49,815 --> 00:18:53,251
and I'm in the doghouse.
And if she finds out about this, it's over.

340
00:18:53,452 --> 00:18:56,285
So, again, I am sorry.
I am so, so sorry.

341
00:18:56,488 --> 00:18:58,820
And you are messing with me
right now, aren't you?

342
00:18:59,024 --> 00:19:02,118
I knew you didn't remember anything
from that phone call last night.

343
00:19:02,328 --> 00:19:06,355
You got dressed up
just to see me sweat?

344
00:19:06,565 --> 00:19:08,795
Oh, believe me. You're worth it.

345
00:19:09,001 --> 00:19:10,628
Sorry. Just chaperoning.
Enjoy the dance.

346
00:19:10,836 --> 00:19:11,825
Wait, Michelle.

347
00:19:12,671 --> 00:19:15,003
Jeff, what's left to say?

348
00:19:15,975 --> 00:19:18,443
Uh... I... I don't know.

349
00:19:18,677 --> 00:19:20,508
I...
I do.

350
00:19:22,548 --> 00:19:24,607
He said it last night.

351
00:19:27,019 --> 00:19:31,319
<i>So look, I am really into Michelle.</i>

352
00:19:31,523 --> 00:19:35,960
<i>And I don't wanna screw it up.
She's a perfect girlfriend.</i>

353
00:19:36,161 --> 00:19:37,856
<i>And I want you to be
as happy as me</i>

354
00:19:38,063 --> 00:19:41,555
<i>because you're, like, my favorite
friend, so... Ha-ha-ha.</i>

355
00:19:41,767 --> 00:19:44,861
<i>I'm sorry.
Abed just made a turtle face.</i>

356
00:19:46,005 --> 00:19:49,532
In his defense,
Abed's turtle face is really funny.

357
00:19:50,042 --> 00:19:53,102
Thanks, Britta.
Yeah, thanks.

358
00:19:54,413 --> 00:19:56,040
Yeah.

359
00:19:56,915 --> 00:19:59,315
That was the first 20 seconds
of a 40-minute message.

360
00:19:59,918 --> 00:20:02,386
Very informative.

361
00:20:05,124 --> 00:20:08,525
Happy Valentine's Day,
perfect boyfriend.

362
00:20:09,061 --> 00:20:11,529
Yeah, that's me.

363
00:20:28,076 --> 00:20:30,806
Man, I cannot wait to get out
of these ridiculous outfits.

364
00:20:31,013 --> 00:20:32,878
Woof! I know, yeah.

365
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:36,381
What are you doing?
I'm parked over here.

366
00:20:36,585 --> 00:20:38,075
Oh, uh, well... Uh...

367
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:41,153
Heh-heh.
Come on.

368
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,754
Um... What the hell is this?

369
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:45,256
We're going to get
frozen yogurt. Aah.

370
00:20:45,461 --> 00:20:47,759
I'm not gay, man.
They close in seven minutes.

371
00:20:47,963 --> 00:20:49,055
I could have driven you.

372
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:51,595
You said he hated fro-yo.

373
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,233
Just drive.

374
00:20:56,572 --> 00:20:57,561
Slut!
