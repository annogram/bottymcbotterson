Okay, this awkward silence
has been going on for days.

12
00:00:56,191 --> 00:00:58,185
Granted, Jeffrey looks amazing
when he broods,

13
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:00,165
but this has got to stop.

14
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,512
Now, I don't know
what happened,

15
00:01:02,536 --> 00:01:05,676
but we have to get
to the bottom of this.

16
00:01:06,031 --> 00:01:07,676
It's too embarrassing.

17
00:01:07,707 --> 00:01:08,929
I understand.

18
00:01:08,953 --> 00:01:10,460
You don't wanna talk about it,

19
00:01:10,496 --> 00:01:12,498
and you won't have to.

20
00:01:12,522 --> 00:01:15,438
They will talk <i>for</i> you.

21
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:18,704
Why did you make, have,
and bring these?

22
00:01:18,724 --> 00:01:19,879
- Mm.
- Don't answer.

23
00:01:19,891 --> 00:01:21,335
- It's puppet therapy.
- Mm-hmm.

24
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:23,378
The psychology world
has recently embraced it

25
00:01:23,396 --> 00:01:25,099
after seeing it on <i>Law & Order.</i>

26
00:01:25,115 --> 00:01:27,355
You'll notice that each puppet
is made in your likeness.

27
00:01:27,373 --> 00:01:28,549
They were a rush job.

28
00:01:28,578 --> 00:01:31,326
It's not like I had them
on hand for personal use.

29
00:01:32,235 --> 00:01:36,115
Excuse me. Let me just grab this thing
that's definitely not a whip.

30
00:01:36,731 --> 00:01:38,635
In addition to being adorable,

31
00:01:38,661 --> 00:01:42,004
I know firsthand that puppet
therapy can and does work.

32
00:01:42,016 --> 00:01:45,388
Uh, Dean, puppet Kevin here thinks
I should have a candy bar right now.

33
00:01:45,456 --> 00:01:47,638
No, you know
how it winds you up.

34
00:01:47,676 --> 00:01:48,932
Fine.
We'll split it.

35
00:01:48,962 --> 00:01:50,983
All right.
Got money, bro?

36
00:01:51,102 --> 00:01:52,902
He's not what he seems!

37
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:54,899
Wait.
Where's Pierce?

38
00:01:55,132 --> 00:01:57,507
I know he's not with us,
but is he still with us?

39
00:01:57,765 --> 00:01:59,164
I'm sure he's fine.

40
00:01:59,555 --> 00:02:02,424
Although, no one's seen him since
he lost his mind in the woods.

41
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,180
You all were in the woods?
Oh.

42
00:02:04,215 --> 00:02:05,926
Oh, so the puppets are working.
Okay.

43
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:07,045
Uh...

44
00:02:07,121 --> 00:02:09,175
How did it start?
What happened?

45
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,094
- We're not playing with puppets.
- Oh, Jeffrey.

46
00:02:11,115 --> 00:02:13,554
Dean, what happened
is between us and Jesus,

47
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:14,812
and Jesus don't snitch.

48
00:02:14,831 --> 00:02:16,487
Yeah, and I don't need
a puppet to express myself.

49
00:02:16,507 --> 00:02:17,894
I already say whatever I want.

50
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:19,967
But I am a fan
of the medium, so...

51
00:02:20,389 --> 00:02:21,634
my father is withholding.

52
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:23,014
- Ow.
- Hm.

53
00:02:23,078 --> 00:02:24,110
That's interesting.

54
00:02:24,146 --> 00:02:27,401
Guys, are we just gonna avoid
making eye contact forever?

55
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:29,545
- Who are we, Jeff during sex?
- Huh?

56
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:31,895
Let's just give it a shot
and move on.

57
00:02:31,935 --> 00:02:32,716
Fine.

58
00:02:32,734 --> 00:02:34,235
If we're gonna play this game,

59
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,204
then, unlike sex with Britta,

60
00:02:36,233 --> 00:02:37,430
we're gonna do it quickly

61
00:02:37,454 --> 00:02:38,998
and with a small shred
of dignity.

62
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:40,686
- Eh.
- Yeah.

63
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,271
Jeffrey, dignity
is my middle name,

64
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:45,531
and my first name is

65
00:02:45,552 --> 00:02:49,421
Dean-nocchio!

66
00:02:56,686 --> 00:02:58,987
- Whoo.
- It all started on Friday.

67
00:02:59,109 --> 00:03:01,168
Britta was talking about a few
of her latest causes.

68
00:03:01,235 --> 00:03:03,105
This one's for the Greendale
animal shelter,

69
00:03:03,117 --> 00:03:05,967
this one's for global warming,
this one's for global cooling,

70
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:08,086
and this one's
for the amount of rubber wasted

71
00:03:08,096 --> 00:03:09,918
while making stupid bracelets.

72
00:03:09,936 --> 00:03:11,246
That's called rubber flubbing,

73
00:03:11,252 --> 00:03:12,721
and it's a real problem.

74
00:03:12,746 --> 00:03:14,407
Open your eyes, people!

75
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,977
Britta said,
"Open your eyes, people."

76
00:03:16,002 --> 00:03:17,215
- Square.
- Nice.

77
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,483
- What are you two doing?
- Oh.

78
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:19,812
We're playing
"Study Group Bingo."

79
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:20,987
Study group bingo?

80
00:03:21,006 --> 00:03:22,289
We've been best friends
for four years,

81
00:03:22,314 --> 00:03:24,516
so we've fallen into a
comfortable, repetitive pattern

82
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,802
like humorous misunderstandings
on <i>Three's Company</i>

83
00:03:26,824 --> 00:03:28,789
or girls gossiping on
<i>Gossip Girl.</i>

84
00:03:28,848 --> 00:03:30,692
So to liven things up,
Troy and I made this bingo chart

85
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,086
of the predictable things
we say.

86
00:03:32,098 --> 00:03:33,801
This game is gay.

87
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:35,569
- Square.
- You're mocking us?

88
00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:37,383
That's not a very Christian
thing to do.

89
00:03:37,395 --> 00:03:38,360
- Square.
- Oh.

90
00:03:38,372 --> 00:03:39,572
Can we go back to studying now?

91
00:03:39,593 --> 00:03:41,983
- Square.
- I don't like this game.

92
00:03:41,995 --> 00:03:43,228
- Me neither.
- I think it's mean.

93
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,562
- There's no point.
- Yeah, it's insulting.

94
00:03:44,581 --> 00:03:46,454
- Okay, stop.
- Square.

95
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,320
Abed's right.

96
00:03:48,341 --> 00:03:50,742
We've had the same conversation
a million times.

97
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:52,497
I guess we're kind of stuck
in a--

98
00:03:52,526 --> 00:03:53,860
- Rut?
- Yes.

99
00:03:53,894 --> 00:03:56,650
But to be fair, there's not many
things you could be stuck in.

100
00:03:56,668 --> 00:03:57,925
- Elevators.
- Bad marriages.

101
00:03:57,942 --> 00:03:59,578
- A peat bog.
- On a flight in the middle seat.

102
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,973
- Time loops.
- The bottom of a well.

103
00:04:00,985 --> 00:04:02,441
- Your own emotions.
- Quicksand.

104
00:04:03,924 --> 00:04:05,760
- Okay, stop!
- Square.

105
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,735
How did we get so predictable?

106
00:04:07,758 --> 00:04:11,260
And here is our
state-of-the-art 1989 library

107
00:04:11,288 --> 00:04:12,526
where--oh, look!

108
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:14,362
It is my favorite study group.

109
00:04:14,393 --> 00:04:16,699
They all really typify
the diversity

110
00:04:16,711 --> 00:04:18,457
we have here at Greendale.

111
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,711
Uh, ruggedly handsome
leading man...

112
00:04:21,492 --> 00:04:22,932
a mom, an activist,

113
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:25,382
a perfect student,
a lifelong learner,

114
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:27,274
a sidekick, and Abed.

115
00:04:27,322 --> 00:04:29,394
Enough foreplay. It's time
to move this tour along

116
00:04:29,413 --> 00:04:32,355
to meet
my good friend Magnitude!

117
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:34,577
Yeah, prepare
to be pop-popped!

118
00:04:34,593 --> 00:04:36,038
Aw, he's a national treasure.

119
00:04:36,057 --> 00:04:38,023
Look, the problem isn't us.

120
00:04:38,042 --> 00:04:39,310
We're awesome.

121
00:04:39,331 --> 00:04:41,297
The problem is Greendale.

122
00:04:41,384 --> 00:04:43,250
It's pulling our strings,
and we need a break.

123
00:04:43,271 --> 00:04:45,406
Yeah, our Ferris Bueller
needs a day off.

124
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,247
Hey, whose dad
has a vintage Ferrari?

125
00:04:47,278 --> 00:04:50,098
Abed, a pop culture reference
is more of the same.

126
00:04:50,134 --> 00:04:51,834
We need to go big.

127
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,242
We need an adventure!

128
00:04:53,264 --> 00:04:56,033
That's a good idea, Annie,
but there's one problem.

129
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,345

172
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,430
Oh, boy.

173
00:07:00,456 --> 00:07:03,531
From now on,
no more singing in the balloon.

174
00:07:03,913 --> 00:07:06,149
- Did I miss it?
- Miss what?

175
00:07:06,245 --> 00:07:08,192
Who said anything
about a runaway balloon?

176
00:07:08,237 --> 00:07:10,939
Okay, let me process this.

177
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,694
<i>No!</i>

178
00:07:14,711 --> 00:07:16,149
- Oh, God.
- Whoa, whoa.

179
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,062
- We're really high.
- I'm really scared of heights.

180
00:07:18,081 --> 00:07:20,408
Guys, what are we gonna do?

181
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:22,379
I had a dream
it would end this way.

182
00:07:22,512 --> 00:07:24,744
Oh, Jeffrey,
you're on a runaway balloon?

183
00:07:24,762 --> 00:07:27,165
You could have died.
You could have died.

184
00:07:27,172 --> 00:07:28,625
How could you almost
let him die?

185
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,180
We all almost died,
but we all didn't.

186
00:07:31,221 --> 00:07:32,673
You know, plus,
a near death experience

187
00:07:32,692 --> 00:07:34,608
would've only brought us
closer together.

188
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,134
Good point.

189
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:38,215
Although it did
get pretty hairy after that

190
00:07:38,235 --> 00:07:40,170
especially once Pierce
started helping.

191
00:07:40,211 --> 00:07:43,024
Okay, everyone push down
with me at the same time.

192
00:07:43,067 --> 00:07:45,488
One, two, three!

193
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:49,369
Come on, people.
I can't do this alone.

194
00:07:49,415 --> 00:07:51,417
You can't do it at all.

195
00:07:51,441 --> 00:07:53,096
Oh, look.
A downstream.

196
00:07:53,754 --> 00:07:55,310
Pierce! No!

197
00:07:55,329 --> 00:07:58,172
Whoa!

198
00:07:58,185 --> 00:07:59,338
If we fly to heaven,

199
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,920
please don't tell my grandpa
about me and Britta.

200
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,666
This is not good.

201
00:08:10,898 --> 00:08:13,201
There are so many clouds.
It's so dark!

202
00:08:13,228 --> 00:08:15,404
I can't even see
the Landing Strip

203
00:08:15,452 --> 00:08:17,014
or any of the other nudie bars.

204
00:08:17,035 --> 00:08:18,870
Oh, heaven, help us.

205
00:08:18,891 --> 00:08:21,048
We must be a mile
above the ground.

206
00:08:21,074 --> 00:08:22,865
That's international airspace.

207
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,761
We're literally above the law.

208
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:26,524
Jeff can marry any man
he wants.

209
00:08:26,543 --> 00:08:27,831
Wait a second, guys.

210
00:08:27,867 --> 00:08:29,769
I think we're starting
to go down.

211
00:08:29,899 --> 00:08:31,579
You see?
Prayer works.

212
00:08:31,605 --> 00:08:33,301
So does gravity, Shirley.

213
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,375
And you know
who invented gravity, right?

214
00:08:35,417 --> 00:08:37,551
- Oh.
- Whoa!

215
00:08:37,585 --> 00:08:41,139
Guys, let's put a pin in the mysteries
of the universe convo until we land.

216
00:08:41,263 --> 00:08:42,658
Which will be sooner
than we thought.

217
00:08:42,691 --> 00:08:44,126
We're gaining
speed fast, people.

218
00:08:44,139 --> 00:08:45,538
Oh!
Brace for impact.

219
00:08:45,562 --> 00:08:48,216
- Oh, damn you, gravity!
- Damn you, prayer!

220
00:08:48,234 --> 00:08:49,505
Damn you, Vicki!

221
00:08:52,716 --> 00:08:54,043
Has anyone else noticed
Professor Duncan

222
00:08:54,068 --> 00:08:55,836
hasn't been around
for a long time?

223
00:08:59,514 --> 00:09:01,144
Maybe I can soften our descent.

224
00:09:01,157 --> 00:09:02,293
Pierce, no!

225
00:09:03,706 --> 00:09:06,238
Bring it to me strong,
old man monkey strength!

226
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:12,004
Okay.

227
00:09:12,263 --> 00:09:14,975
Okay, obviously,
that was very scary.

228
00:09:14,989 --> 00:09:17,440
Post-traumatic stress
is a real issue,

229
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:20,470
but with these puppets
giving voice to our feelings,

230
00:09:20,513 --> 00:09:22,914
we can begin to heal.
- Hey, come on.

231
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:25,957
This is gonna be
a long and arduous process.

232
00:09:25,988 --> 00:09:27,154
There's more.

233
00:09:27,182 --> 00:09:28,767
Hey, well, excuse Dean

234
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:31,806
for reacting to the natural lull
in your story.

235
00:09:32,134 --> 00:09:33,399
I'm so sorry.

236
00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:36,986
When you hurt, I hurt.

237
00:09:37,946 --> 00:09:38,879
What happened next?

238
00:09:38,913 --> 00:09:40,014
Whoa.

239
00:09:40,048 --> 00:09:41,715
- We made it.
- Everyone okay?

240
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,115
- I'm alive.
- Square.

241
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:45,186
- Guys, knock it off.
- Okay, still alive?

242
00:09:45,197 --> 00:09:47,072
Okay, we're all safe.

243
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:49,739
We just have to figure out
how to get back to Greendale.

244
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,268
But we're in the middle
of the woods.

245
00:09:52,293 --> 00:09:53,378
Where do we start?

246
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:55,750
We need to split into two groups,
the survivors and the others.

247
00:09:55,774 --> 00:09:56,676
Where's the manifest?

248
00:09:56,693 --> 00:09:58,549
Oh, stop it
with your <i>Lost</i> references.

249
00:09:58,566 --> 00:09:59,918
We need to get back home.

250
00:09:59,929 --> 00:10:01,317
What if we're stuck here?

251
00:10:01,364 --> 00:10:02,937
We need to start
a prison system.

252
00:10:02,956 --> 00:10:04,701
We'll be stranded here forever,

253
00:10:04,721 --> 00:10:06,090
and I've never seen
blue man group!

254
00:10:06,116 --> 00:10:08,178
Guys, guys,
we're gonna make it outta here.

255
00:10:08,197 --> 00:10:09,895
We gotta relax.
We're all gonna be fine.

256
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,418
Ahh!

257
00:10:11,434 --> 00:10:12,320
What is that?

258
00:10:12,331 --> 00:10:14,033
I just want to say,
if we're gonna die,

259
00:10:14,038 --> 00:10:14,826
I love you guys.

260
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,552
- I love you all too.
- I did see blue man group.

261
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:18,865
I just didn't get it.

262
00:10:18,883 --> 00:10:21,044
Why can't they talk?
They have so much in common.

263
00:10:25,188 --> 00:10:26,455
- Others!
- Huh?

264
00:10:27,985 --> 00:10:28,942
Oh!

265
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,211
I'm sorry.

266
00:10:31,193 --> 00:10:32,601
I didn't mean
to startle anybody.

267
00:10:33,475 --> 00:10:35,121
And I thought my hair
looked fake.

268
00:10:35,147 --> 00:10:38,076
Oh, you guys are a long,
long way from Greendale.

269
00:10:38,091 --> 00:10:40,120
How did you know
we're from Greendale?

270
00:10:40,179 --> 00:10:41,475
Oh, from Pierce's shirt.

271
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,274
How did you know
my name is Pierce?

272
00:10:43,298 --> 00:10:45,158
It's embroidered
on your Greendale shirt

273
00:10:45,176 --> 00:10:46,584
you got at the student store.

274
00:10:46,615 --> 00:10:48,556
How'd you know I got it
at the student store?

275
00:10:48,567 --> 00:10:50,913
- I'm a touch psychic.
- Oh! Huh. Hm.

276
00:10:50,936 --> 00:10:53,155
Anyway, I used to go
to Greendale just like you guys

277
00:10:53,178 --> 00:10:55,086
before I came out here
to be free.

278
00:10:55,123 --> 00:10:57,889
So this is
how Greendale graduates end up:

279
00:10:57,903 --> 00:10:59,970
As transient mountain men.

280
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,003
Huh.
Not as bad as I thought.

281
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:03,903
But don't you miss
having stuff?

282
00:11:03,961 --> 00:11:06,931
Out here,
you have everything you need.

283
00:11:06,985 --> 00:11:09,653
And you can be
whoever you wanna be.

284
00:11:09,687 --> 00:11:10,922
- Huh.
- Oh.

Simply inspiring.

325
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:54,956
Ten minutes ago,
you weren't even speaking.

326
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:57,106
And now, you've admitted
that a strange man

327
00:12:57,139 --> 00:12:59,207
hand-fed you
psychotropic berries.

328
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,107
- This is puppet therapy work--
- Dean!

329
00:13:01,135 --> 00:13:04,304
- There is a fire in the cafeteria.
- Garrett, <i>not now!</i>

330
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:09,057
Where was I?
Ah! I was healing you.

331
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:10,523
Hm?
Go on.

332
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:15,344
Well, those devil berries
freed our minds

333
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:18,514
and loosened our tongues.

334
00:13:19,558 --> 00:13:23,552
Your skin is so beautiful

335
00:13:23,635 --> 00:13:25,470
and soft.

336
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,302
It's like felt.

337
00:13:30,789 --> 00:13:32,197
I feel so free out here,

338
00:13:32,236 --> 00:13:33,613
like I'm my own man.

339
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,514
If Jeff said
we had to live out here,

340
00:13:35,536 --> 00:13:37,301
I'd totally be down with that.

341
00:13:37,318 --> 00:13:39,013
Me too.

342
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:40,625
Can I tell you guys a secret?

343
00:13:40,644 --> 00:13:43,886
Yeah, sure.

344
00:13:43,937 --> 00:13:46,003
I was at the grocery store
with my kids,

345
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:49,471
and I thought I saw Andre
walk by with another woman.

346
00:13:49,546 --> 00:13:51,647
I love women.

347
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:53,306
Mm.

348
00:13:53,345 --> 00:13:55,253
I'm gonna go take a growler.

349
00:13:55,304 --> 00:13:58,278
Anyway, I wanted
to follow Andre and the woman,

350
00:13:58,298 --> 00:14:00,211
so I left my kids
at the magazine stand

351
00:14:00,241 --> 00:14:02,056
for just a minute, but somehow,

352
00:14:02,081 --> 00:14:04,275
I lost track of time
and ended up tailing them

353
00:14:04,294 --> 00:14:05,984
all the way out of town.

354
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,100
It wasn't even Andre.

355
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:11,509
The horrible part is
I forgot my kids

356
00:14:11,528 --> 00:14:15,414
and left them all night
in the grocery store.

357
00:14:25,638 --> 00:14:29,450
Well, there y'all go,
giving me that look,

358
00:14:29,629 --> 00:14:31,475
treating me like Judas,

359
00:14:31,499 --> 00:14:33,698
judging me like Judy.

360
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:37,528
You know, Judge Judy.
She judges people.

361
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:40,280
Shirley, this is the first
I've heard of you

362
00:14:40,298 --> 00:14:42,269
leaving your kids
in a grocery store.

363
00:14:42,293 --> 00:14:43,155
Me too.

364
00:14:43,191 --> 00:14:44,558
I have no memory
of you saying that.

365
00:14:44,576 --> 00:14:45,794
Well, if you don't know
my secret,

366
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,947
why have we all been
so awkward around each other?

367
00:14:47,967 --> 00:14:50,176
I thought everyone heard
my secret.

368
00:14:50,231 --> 00:14:52,205
I didn't hear you say anything.

369
00:14:52,294 --> 00:14:55,099
So nobody else heard
my terrible secret

370
00:14:55,111 --> 00:14:57,661
about how I...

371
00:14:58,005 --> 00:15:01,041
trail off from time to time?

372
00:15:01,212 --> 00:15:03,047
Did everyone here
reveal a secret?

373
00:15:03,081 --> 00:15:04,148
Mm-hmm.

374
00:15:04,172 --> 00:15:07,630
And no one remembers
anyone else's, including mine?

375
00:15:07,662 --> 00:15:08,971
Mm-mm.

376
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,527
Those berries made
us real talky but

377
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,120
not real listen-y.

378
00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:16,032
So if no one heard or remembers

379
00:15:16,065 --> 00:15:18,433
anything anyone else said...

380
00:15:18,461 --> 00:15:20,075
We're in the clear.

381
00:15:20,099 --> 00:15:21,799

382
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,442

- Yeah!

383

384
00:15:27,332 --> 00:15:30,038
Um, guys?

385
00:15:41,736 --> 00:15:43,831
Um, don't mind me.

386
00:15:44,059 --> 00:15:46,518
I'm sure you guys can get on
with your lives without the

387
00:15:46,537 --> 00:15:49,005
worst mom ever.

388
00:15:52,711 --> 00:15:54,219
Sounds good.
Anyone up for a movie?

389
00:15:54,259 --> 00:15:55,793
Abed, sit.

390
00:15:56,157 --> 00:15:58,775
Shirley, you have nothing
to be ashamed of.

391
00:15:58,794 --> 00:16:01,414
No one thinks you're a bad mom.

392
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:05,052
Thanks, Jeff, but I'm--
I'm just gonna go home now.

393
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:06,499
Shirley, wait.

394
00:16:06,614 --> 00:16:10,015
I think I know how to make
you feel a little less horrible.

395
00:16:10,051 --> 00:16:12,184
I like where you're headed.
Okay, who's holding?

396
00:16:12,202 --> 00:16:13,041
I have four berries,

397
00:16:13,067 --> 00:16:14,812
but I am saving them
for Laser Floyd.

398
00:16:14,837 --> 00:16:17,860
No, we all need
to re-share our secrets sober.

399
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:19,054
Oh, God.

400
00:16:19,085 --> 00:16:21,562
Look, we were all
feeling crappy earlier,

401
00:16:21,568 --> 00:16:23,437
but at least we were
feeling crappy together.

402
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:25,250
Shirley is alone now.

403
00:16:25,282 --> 00:16:27,429
This is the only way to put us
on equal footing,

404
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,908
and if it makes it any easier,

405
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:31,154
we can use these puppets.

406
00:16:31,187 --> 00:16:32,587
- Ah, yay!
- Shut up.

407
00:16:32,626 --> 00:16:34,254
Okay.

408
00:16:35,768 --> 00:16:37,873

I am not what you would
call traditionally--

444
00:18:45,156 --> 00:18:47,435
Wait, Abed,
you never told us your secret.

445
00:18:47,473 --> 00:18:48,773
- Oh.
- That's right.

446
00:18:48,816 --> 00:18:49,894
I didn't share one that night.

447
00:18:49,913 --> 00:18:50,980
After we got back
from the woods,

448
00:18:50,991 --> 00:18:53,163
everyone was being silent
and not making eye contact.

449
00:18:53,193 --> 00:18:55,682
I didn't know why,
so I mirrored your behavior.

450
00:18:55,704 --> 00:18:56,805
Oh.

451
00:18:56,826 --> 00:18:58,510
Mm.

452
00:18:58,661 --> 00:19:00,174
Thank you, Jeff,

453
00:19:00,209 --> 00:19:02,464
and I don't think you're
anything like your father.

454
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:05,390
I don't know how you take
care of one kid, let alone three.

455
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:08,023
Aw.
That's nice.

456
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:10,981
So nobody thinks
I'm a slutty cheater?

457
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:12,468
No.

458
00:19:12,509 --> 00:19:14,587
- Or me as a criminal?
- No.

459
00:19:15,352 --> 00:19:19,306
Nobody respects me any less
as a political activist, right?

460
00:19:20,068 --> 00:19:22,196
Well, uh...

461
00:19:24,797 --> 00:19:26,631
the level
to which we respect you

462
00:19:26,664 --> 00:19:29,780
as a political activist
has definitely not changed.

463
00:19:29,806 --> 00:19:30,650
That's right.

464
00:19:30,675 --> 00:19:31,955
- That's how I would say it.
- Exactly.

465
00:19:31,979 --> 00:19:33,403
Whew.
Bye, Dean.

Knowledge is a party.

I help fix everyone's problems

469
