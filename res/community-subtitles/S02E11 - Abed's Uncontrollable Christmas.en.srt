1
00:00:02,898 --> 00:00:05,908
It's that very special time of year,
Greendale.

2
00:00:05,908 --> 00:00:07,628
A time for me to remind you

3
00:00:07,629 --> 00:00:10,355
that your school acknowledges
no specialness

4
00:00:10,355 --> 00:00:11,830
to this time of year.

5
00:00:11,865 --> 00:00:14,378
You do, of course, have
a constitutional right

6
00:00:14,378 --> 00:00:15,723
to lend this season

7
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:17,135
the significance of your choosing

8
00:00:17,135 --> 00:00:19,940
in any of our designated holiday zones.

9
00:00:22,443 --> 00:00:23,614
Merry Christmas, everybody.

10
00:00:23,614 --> 00:00:25,454
Don't you mean season's greetings?

11
00:00:25,455 --> 00:00:26,968
Come on, Shirley. You know it's Christmas.

12
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:28,545
Yes, but as a modern Christian,

13
00:00:28,545 --> 00:00:29,777
I've learned to be sensitive

14
00:00:29,778 --> 00:00:31,277
to other cultures' jealousies.

15
00:00:31,277 --> 00:00:32,444
So what are we doing this year?

16
00:00:32,445 --> 00:00:34,234
Well, I'm taking a relaxation course

17
00:00:34,235 --> 00:00:35,216
next semester.

18
00:00:35,218 --> 00:00:36,268
And I was going to use the break

19
00:00:36,268 --> 00:00:37,619
to do all the reading in advance.

20
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:39,679
I'm shutting myself in with my video games.

21
00:00:39,734 --> 00:00:41,365
Fake-murdering people is gonna be

22
00:00:41,365 --> 00:00:43,029
my new holiday tradition.

23
00:00:43,515 --> 00:00:44,738
Hm. This is disappointing.

24
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,268
What do you care about Christmas, Abed?

25
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:46,991
You're Muslim.

26
00:00:46,993 --> 00:00:48,085
Don't your people spend this season

27
00:00:48,085 --> 00:00:49,871
writing angry letters to TV guide?

28
00:00:49,872 --> 00:00:51,610
It's true. Religiously, I'm Muslim.

29
00:00:51,612 --> 00:00:53,286
But I've always been a big fan
of Christmas.

30
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:54,789
And this is the most important Christmas

31
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:56,337
in the history of the universe.

32
00:00:56,338 --> 00:00:58,473
I'm assuming that's why we're all
stop-motion animated.

33
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,765
I vote we let it go.

34
00:01:01,774 --> 00:01:03,265
What did you say we were, Abed?

35
00:01:03,267 --> 00:01:04,338
We're stop-motion animated.

36
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,659
I don't understand what he's saying.

37
00:01:05,661 --> 00:01:07,436
I never understand what
any of you are saying.

38
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:08,421
You guys don't see it?

39
00:01:08,423 --> 00:01:09,766
I noticed it this morning.

40
00:01:09,787 --> 00:01:11,424
That's how I knew it was
a special Christmas.

41
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:13,031
We've clearly entered a whole new medium.

42
00:01:16,814 --> 00:01:18,781
It's probably Arabic for "not clearly."

43
00:01:19,688 --> 00:01:21,593
You really expect me to tarnish
the high five

44
00:01:21,593 --> 00:01:22,748
for that?

45
00:01:23,033 --> 00:01:24,759
You guys really don't see what I'm seeing?

46
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:26,926
That worries me a little.

47
00:01:26,927 --> 00:01:28,611
I think it worries all of us.

48
00:01:28,612 --> 00:01:30,186
Is there something that we can do

49
00:01:30,186 --> 00:01:33,533
to help you with your situation, Abed?

50
00:01:33,534 --> 00:01:35,075
For starters, you could move around more.

51
00:01:35,076 --> 00:01:36,127
Not much point in being animated

52
00:01:36,128 --> 00:01:36,944
if you don't.

53
00:01:36,945 --> 00:01:38,388
And I think we should commit to the format.

54
00:01:38,537 --> 00:01:40,067
Starting with a song.

55
00:01:41,521 --> 00:01:43,774
You start. I'm sure we'll join in.

Okay, we got him.

69
00:02:11,123 --> 00:02:12,627
We got him. He's down.

70
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:15,677
Now, how many fingers am I holding up?

71
00:02:15,679 --> 00:02:17,001
And, more importantly,

72
00:02:17,002 --> 00:02:18,836
are they still made of clay?

73
00:02:18,837 --> 00:02:20,262
Three, and I told you, we're not clay.

74
00:02:20,263 --> 00:02:21,647
We're silicone dolls with foam bodies

75
00:02:21,649 --> 00:02:23,026
over ball-and-socket armatures.

76
00:02:23,026 --> 00:02:24,295
Fascinating.

77
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,731
And publishable.

78
00:02:25,733 --> 00:02:27,332
And you say you have no memory

79
00:02:27,334 --> 00:02:28,245
of this morning.

80
00:02:28,246 --> 00:02:30,222
You don't recall the emotional crisis

81
00:02:30,223 --> 00:02:31,560
that caused you to take shelter

82
00:02:31,561 --> 00:02:32,652
in this delusion.

83
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:35,526
- It's not a delusion.
- Very, very publishable.

84
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,836
Abed, I've been a professor of psychology

85
00:02:37,836 --> 00:02:40,391
here at Greendale for many years.

86
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:42,156
And I think I see a solution to this

87
00:02:42,158 --> 00:02:45,326
that might also help you
with your situation.

88
00:02:45,328 --> 00:02:47,437
I'd like to do extensive sessions with you,

89
00:02:47,438 --> 00:02:48,834
including hypnosis.

90
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,865
- I don't need therapy.
- Nobody said you did.

91
00:02:50,865 --> 00:02:52,686
I just think it would benefit you

92
00:02:52,687 --> 00:02:54,997
and, incidentally, me,

93
00:02:54,998 --> 00:02:57,466
to get to the real meaning of all this.

94
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:58,860
You're right. That's it.

95
00:02:58,861 --> 00:03:00,373
I need to find the meaning of Christmas.

96
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:01,322
Ah, well...

97
00:03:01,323 --> 00:03:02,384
If I can find the meaning of Christmas,

98
00:03:02,385 --> 00:03:03,891
everything will go back to normal.

99
00:03:03,921 --> 00:03:04,820
Asterisk.

100
00:03:04,822 --> 00:03:06,060
Abed, the dean says

101
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:07,260
if you don't get help,

102
00:03:07,262 --> 00:03:09,209
they might kick you out of school.

103
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:10,241
Why would I want to be in a school

104
00:03:10,242 --> 00:03:11,685
that hates Christmas?

105
00:03:12,752 --> 00:03:13,923
He's got a point.

106
00:03:13,924 --> 00:03:15,055
Kidding.

107
00:03:15,103 --> 00:03:17,912

00:03:18,104 --> 00:03:21,087

111
00:03:27,277 --> 00:03:28,685
I don't suppose you know
the meaning of Christmas,

112
00:03:28,686 --> 00:03:29,846
lonely snowman.

113
00:03:29,847 --> 00:03:31,396
Apparently, it means getting fondled

114
00:03:31,397 --> 00:03:32,951
by singing mental cases.

115
00:03:32,953 --> 00:03:34,346
My snowman is alive!

116
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:35,563
I'm not a snowman.

117
00:03:35,564 --> 00:03:36,698
I'm Chang.

118
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:38,288
What the hell's wrong with you today?

119
00:03:38,288 --> 00:03:39,221
I thought I made you.

120
00:03:39,222 --> 00:03:40,573
Yeah, you made me need to cry

121
00:03:40,574 --> 00:03:42,001
in the shower tonight.

122
00:03:42,824 --> 00:03:43,944
It's a text from Britta.

123
00:03:43,944 --> 00:03:45,225
She says, "the meaning of Christmas

124
00:03:45,227 --> 00:03:46,715
is in the study room."

125
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,650
Hey, now that you started it,

126
00:03:48,651 --> 00:03:51,373
how 'bout ten more seconds
on that third button, huh?

127
00:03:55,585 --> 00:03:57,737
You lied to lure me into
a group therapy session?

128
00:03:57,739 --> 00:03:58,662
Surprise!

129
00:03:58,663 --> 00:04:00,751
Pierce, you promised not to do that.

130
00:04:00,794 --> 00:04:01,929
Surprise.

131
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,485
- Not cool.
- H-h-hold on, Abed.

132
00:04:03,486 --> 00:04:05,112
I'm not just a psych professor.

133
00:04:05,114 --> 00:04:08,354
I'm also a Christmas wizard.

134
00:04:08,355 --> 00:04:08,985
You are?

135
00:04:08,986 --> 00:04:09,778
I am.

136
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,560
And I can help you find
the meaning of Christmas.

137
00:04:13,561 --> 00:04:14,419
Right, guys?

138
00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:16,076
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, yeah.

139
00:04:16,134 --> 00:04:17,524
Oh, this feels safe.

140
00:04:17,526 --> 00:04:18,654
Shut up, Winger.

141
00:04:18,656 --> 00:04:20,637
What do you think, Abed?

142
00:04:20,637 --> 00:04:22,627
Christmas wizard. Hm.

143
00:04:23,856 --> 00:04:24,946
I guess I can see that.

144
00:04:24,947 --> 00:04:26,204
Have a seat, then.

145
00:04:26,206 --> 00:04:27,826
Nothing to be afraid of.

146
00:04:27,827 --> 00:04:29,269
All your friends are here.

147
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,367
They just want to help.

148
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:33,262
I'm here for the cookies.

149
00:04:33,264 --> 00:04:34,228
So what do we do?

150
00:04:34,228 --> 00:04:35,244
Well, with your permission,

151
00:04:35,245 --> 00:04:36,586
I'd like to put you into a state

152
00:04:36,586 --> 00:04:39,391
of christmasnosis

153
00:04:39,391 --> 00:04:42,076
and take you on a magic journey.

154
00:04:42,077 --> 00:04:43,069
To winter wonderland?

155
00:04:43,071 --> 00:04:43,932
Sure.

156
00:04:43,932 --> 00:04:46,274
Your own personal winter wonderland.

157
00:04:46,276 --> 00:04:47,490
Come on, everyone.

158
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:50,009
You all know how magic
Christmas journeys work.

159
00:04:50,011 --> 00:04:51,055
Mm-hmm.

160
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:52,678
You are playing with so much fire.

161
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,899
Shut up, Winger.

162
00:04:53,899 --> 00:04:55,417
Hands on the table.

163
00:04:55,442 --> 00:04:56,932
Eyes closed.

164
00:04:56,949 --> 00:04:58,192
Heads relaxing.

165
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,608
Necks relaxing.

166
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,702
Don't relax Pierce any lower.

167
00:05:01,704 --> 00:05:02,569
Screw you.

168
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:05,300
Abed, focus on the sound of my voice,

169
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,319
and let yourself relax.

170
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:09,314
With each breath, you'll feel...

171
00:05:09,314 --> 00:05:10,634
- It's beginning.
- All right, then.

172
00:05:10,634 --> 00:05:11,514
The table's moving.

173
00:05:11,516 --> 00:05:13,538
Shaking like a rocket about to take off.

174
00:05:13,555 --> 00:05:14,838
Now it's leaving the floor

175
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:16,302
as the walls and the ceiling fly away.

176
00:05:16,867 --> 00:05:19,007
We're in outer Christmas space.

177
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,466
There's planet holly.

178
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:21,910
And planet jolly.

179
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,274
Oh, and what's that up ahead?

180
00:05:24,274 --> 00:05:26,389
Ah, it's planet Abed.

181
00:05:26,391 --> 00:05:27,021
Subtle.

182
00:05:27,023 --> 00:05:27,930
Yeah, we're actually descending

183
00:05:27,932 --> 00:05:29,057
onto planet Abed now.

184
00:05:29,057 --> 00:05:31,047
It's the most christmassy planet
in the universe.

185
00:05:31,048 --> 00:05:32,894
Its atmosphere is 7% cinnamon.

186
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,161
Awww.

187
00:05:38,365 --> 00:05:40,158
We're here. Winter wonderland.

188
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,112
See how sparkly?

189
00:05:41,112 --> 00:05:42,769
What, are you crazy?
All I see is the study...

190
00:05:42,771 --> 00:05:44,807
Ooh, sparkly wonderland.

191
00:05:44,807 --> 00:05:46,192
You might notice that during our journey,

192
00:05:46,192 --> 00:05:47,680
you've transformed into Christmas versions

193
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,725
of yourselves.

Cool! Do I have a gun?

198
00:05:56,476 --> 00:05:58,134
- You have a drum.
- Cool.

199
00:05:58,136 --> 00:05:59,680
Britta, you're Britta-bot.

200
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:00,982
- Uh...
- Just go with it.

201
00:06:00,983 --> 00:06:02,363
Bleep, bloop.

Baby doll Shirley.

207
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:11,901
Baby what? What the hell?

208
00:06:12,278 --> 00:06:14,322
Well, we are making fabulous

209
00:06:14,322 --> 00:06:16,812
and unexpectedly intense progress.

210
00:06:16,814 --> 00:06:18,076
Now, what I'd like to do

211
00:06:18,076 --> 00:06:22,478
is visit the cave of frozen memories.

212
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,978
Pass. Let's head for the north pole.

213
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,612
The meaning of Christmas will be there.

214
00:06:25,641 --> 00:06:27,187
Um, well, yeah.

215
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:28,295
Yeah, sure. Cheers.

216
00:06:28,295 --> 00:06:30,322
And I actually think I know a shortcut

217
00:06:30,324 --> 00:06:31,331
to the north pole

218
00:06:31,331 --> 00:06:34,066
through the cave of frozen memor...

219
00:06:34,067 --> 00:06:35,213
Fine, I guess we can take gumdrop road

220
00:06:35,215 --> 00:06:36,783
through Carol Canyon
and stop at the cave.

221
00:06:36,784 --> 00:06:37,913
I wouldn't call it a shortcut,

222
00:06:37,913 --> 00:06:39,853

Fair warning, guys.

A journey through winter wonderland

236
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:15,841
tends to test your commitment to Christmas.

A great place...

It's actually the cave of frozen peas.

It's a common mistake.

Terrific.

250
00:07:39,122 --> 00:07:41,584
Abed, did you say my Christmas self

251
00:07:41,584 --> 00:07:42,632
was a baby?

252
00:07:42,634 --> 00:07:45,144
Are you sure you didn't say
I was a Christmas angel?

253
00:07:45,144 --> 00:07:46,528
I think that must be what you said, right?

254
00:07:46,529 --> 00:07:47,451
Because you respect me too much

255
00:07:47,451 --> 00:07:48,398
to imagine me as a baby.

256
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:50,502
Jeez, maybe if you cry enough,
he'll change you.

257
00:07:50,502 --> 00:07:52,523
Uh, you do know why he said
you were a robot, right?

258
00:07:52,524 --> 00:07:54,399
Because I'm progressive and kick ass.

259

How 'bout heartless and godless?

260
00:07:55,971 --> 00:07:57,786
I think he just gave us random identities,

you guys.

I mean, me, a ballerina?

It's not like I'm that thin and graceful.

264
00:08:03,201 --> 00:08:04,026
Right?

265
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:07,432
Annie, it's because you're fragile
and tightly wound.

Uh, you know what, Abed?

271
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,689
I happen to know the meaning of Christmas.

here that does.

00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:31,629
What do you mean, cave-like? It's a cave.

338
00:10:31,863 --> 00:10:33,032
Nothing to be afraid of.

339
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:36,232
The cave of frozen memories is a safe place

340
00:10:36,234 --> 00:10:39,788
where we can observe suppressed experiences

341
00:10:39,788 --> 00:10:42,202
without being affected by them.

342
00:10:42,203 --> 00:10:43,350
Can you show me how to do it?

343
00:10:43,557 --> 00:10:44,453
Sure.

344
00:10:44,455 --> 00:10:47,187
Here, I'm focusing on a part of the cave,

345
00:10:47,187 --> 00:10:49,705
and I'm seeing my tenth Christmas.

346
00:10:49,706 --> 00:10:50,452
All right?

347
00:10:50,453 --> 00:10:52,330
Now you try with this morning.

348
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,466
I can't see your tenth Christmas.

349
00:10:54,466 --> 00:10:55,631
How do you even know that's you?

350
00:10:55,633 --> 00:10:58,706
Well, it's my house on 52nd street

351
00:10:58,707 --> 00:10:59,672
in Islington.

352
00:10:59,673 --> 00:11:01,557
What room are you in?
What color are the walls?

353
00:11:01,558 --> 00:11:02,815
Our living room.

354
00:11:02,816 --> 00:11:04,326
Cream-colored plaster.

355
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,096
There's an oil painting of a forest

356
00:11:06,097 --> 00:11:07,467
above the sofa.

357
00:11:07,908 --> 00:11:09,780
I'm reading Paddington books.

358
00:11:10,114 --> 00:11:12,480
Mom got me Paddington every year.

359
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,662
Where's your dad?

360
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,316
It's Christmas, professor.

361
00:11:15,317 --> 00:11:16,150
Where is your dad?

362
00:11:16,152 --> 00:11:18,404
I don't know! We never know!

363
00:11:18,405 --> 00:11:20,128
Mom won't stop crying!

364
00:11:20,129 --> 00:11:22,794
I'm going to America with grandma!

365
00:11:28,538 --> 00:11:30,315
He is good.

366
00:11:30,316 --> 00:11:31,549
We lost our wizard.

367
00:11:31,551 --> 00:11:32,950
We don't need him. Never did.

368
00:11:32,951 --> 00:11:34,496
And nobody needs this cave.

369
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,296
Initiate self-destruct.

370
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:39,639
Self-destruct initiating.

371
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:43,422
This slide goes directly
to pine tree station.

372
00:11:43,423 --> 00:11:45,240
We can catch a train
to the north pole from there.

373
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:46,624
The wizard didn't bring us here

374
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:47,974
to find the meaning of Christmas.

375
00:11:47,975 --> 00:11:49,488
And I can't have anyone
going beyond this point

376
00:11:49,489 --> 00:11:50,797
that's on his side.

377
00:11:52,403 --> 00:11:53,673
With you to the end, man.

378
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,302
Always.

379
00:12:01,245 --> 00:12:03,043
Like I said, I came for the cookies.

380
00:12:03,043 --> 00:12:04,035
Ouch!

381
00:12:04,434 --> 00:12:05,227
I'm not ejecting you

382
00:12:05,229 --> 00:12:06,831
for your not liking Christmas music,
Britta.

383
00:12:06,832 --> 00:12:07,985
I'm ejecting you for lying

384
00:12:07,986 --> 00:12:09,200
to trick me into therapy.

385
00:12:09,201 --> 00:12:12,325
Abed, they will kick you out of school.

386
00:12:12,337 --> 00:12:14,302
I was trying to save you.

395
00:12:51,866 --> 00:12:54,475
Damn, it got real up in that memory cave.

396
00:12:54,475 --> 00:12:55,767
I know, right?

397
00:12:55,768 --> 00:12:57,474
Speaking of real, this has been great.

398
00:12:57,475 --> 00:12:58,496
But the cookies are gone,

399
00:12:58,498 --> 00:13:00,102
and I have to take a giant leak.

400
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,432
We should be at the north pole

401
00:13:03,433 --> 00:13:05,373
00 eastern candy time.

402
00:13:05,475 --> 00:13:06,888
You guys see the countryside?

403
00:13:07,133 --> 00:13:08,505
There's the menorah mountains.

404
00:13:08,506 --> 00:13:09,822
And Jehovah witness bay.

405
00:13:09,827 --> 00:13:11,350
Thanks for adding that, man.

406
00:13:12,599 --> 00:13:14,513
This is nicer than all the Christmases

407
00:13:14,514 --> 00:13:15,888
I ever celebrated.

408
00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:16,880
But you're Jewish.

409
00:13:16,881 --> 00:13:18,072
On my mom's side.

410
00:13:18,072 --> 00:13:19,738
But my dad's episcopalian.

411
00:13:19,739 --> 00:13:21,279
And before the divorce,

412
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,063
the holidays were a minefield
of overlapping rituals.

413
00:13:24,065 --> 00:13:25,399
I like the rituals.

414
00:13:25,615 --> 00:13:27,142
My parents are divorced, too.

415
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:28,525
My mom's Polish.

416
00:13:28,527 --> 00:13:29,894
She loves Christmas.

417
00:13:29,894 --> 00:13:31,783
Every year, she visits on the same day.

418
00:13:31,783 --> 00:13:32,790
December 9th.

419
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:34,004
And every year, we sit and watch

420
00:13:34,004 --> 00:13:36,357
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer together,

421
00:13:36,542 --> 00:13:37,582
every year.

422
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,514
But, Abed, today is December 9th.

423
00:13:41,874 --> 00:13:43,924
It's the last day of classes.

424
00:13:45,447 --> 00:13:46,365
Yeah.

425
00:13:46,365 --> 00:13:47,456
That can't be right.

426
00:13:47,456 --> 00:13:48,624
She comes every year.

427
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,216
Today must be December 8th.

428
00:13:50,966 --> 00:13:52,221
'Cause she comes every year.

429
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,274
Okay, Abed.

430
00:13:57,275 --> 00:13:58,692
Time to stop the train.

431
00:13:58,758 --> 00:14:01,172
After you emasculated me in the ice caves,

432
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,922
I went to your dorm room.

433
00:14:02,929 --> 00:14:04,527
I know what happened now.

434
00:14:04,528 --> 00:14:05,157
It doesn't matter.

435
00:14:05,158 --> 00:14:06,230
I just need to get to the north pole.

436
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:08,390
Abed, there is no north pole.

437
00:14:08,392 --> 00:14:09,933
We're in the library study room,

438
00:14:09,934 --> 00:14:11,763
and I'm not a Christmas wizard.

439
00:14:11,764 --> 00:14:12,476
I know.

440
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,085
You're a Christmas warlock.

441
00:14:14,864 --> 00:14:16,030
You're trying to destroy Christmas

442
00:14:16,032 --> 00:14:17,523
because you blame your sadness on it.

443
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:18,774
I'm crawling out the window.

444
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:19,777
No, you're not.

445
00:14:19,778 --> 00:14:21,186
Snap out of it.

446
00:14:21,187 --> 00:14:22,440
Whoa, whoa, who taught you therapy?

447
00:14:22,441 --> 00:14:23,500
Michael Jackson's dad?

448
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,000
I am a professional.

449
00:14:25,001 --> 00:14:25,846
And you are tampering

450
00:14:25,847 --> 00:14:27,705
with a highly delicate book deal.

451
00:14:27,706 --> 00:14:29,524
I mean, human being.

452
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:30,924
Oh, now we're losing him.

453
00:14:30,926 --> 00:14:32,144
I'm on the roof of the train.

454
00:14:32,145 --> 00:14:32,971
Oh, great.

455
00:14:32,971 --> 00:14:35,205
Well, I'm teleporting there.

456
00:14:35,206 --> 00:14:36,587
Because I can do that.

457
00:14:36,588 --> 00:14:38,421
'Cause I'm a wizard.

458
00:14:38,422 --> 00:14:39,477
Bloink!

459
00:14:40,937 --> 00:14:43,063
Abed, there is no train.

460
00:14:43,065 --> 00:14:44,759
This is not real!

461
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:45,811
I can't hear you.

462
00:14:45,812 --> 00:14:47,245
I'm going to the front car.

463
00:14:47,798 --> 00:14:48,971
You're very clever.

464
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:50,701
But it stops here.

465
00:14:50,712 --> 00:14:52,196
There's no more journey.

466
00:14:52,197 --> 00:14:54,227
It's just you against reality.

467
00:14:54,229 --> 00:14:56,945
And reality always wins.

468
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,149
Abed!

469
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,142
I'm unhitching the cars, okay?

470
00:15:00,413 --> 00:15:02,582
What? Oh, give me a break.

471
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,057
Do you know what you're doing?

472
00:15:04,058 --> 00:15:06,034
Bloink! We're learning to teleport.

473
00:15:06,035 --> 00:15:07,865
And we're helping our friend
find the meaning

474
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:08,860
of Christmas.

475
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,197
Hey, you're actually grabbing me

476
00:15:10,197 --> 00:15:11,857
in real life, delinquent!

477
00:15:11,859 --> 00:15:13,481
We'll keep him away, Abed!

478
00:15:13,482 --> 00:15:14,341
Go!

479
00:15:14,341 --> 00:15:16,207
Find the meaning of Christmas!

480
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,485
At the very least,

481
00:15:17,485 --> 00:15:19,113
take notes!

482
00:15:36,842 --> 00:15:38,536
Whoof. All right, where are we?

483
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:39,664
Christmas train?

484
00:15:40,924 --> 00:15:42,408
I didn't wanna go home.

485
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,375
It's depressing there this time of year.

486
00:16:00,013 --> 00:16:01,423
What are we looking at?

487
00:16:02,485 --> 00:16:03,750
Santa's workshop.

488
00:16:10,075 --> 00:16:10,673
Okay.

489
00:16:10,673 --> 00:16:12,408
So, meaning of Christmas, right?

490
00:16:12,518 --> 00:16:13,585
You see it?

491
00:16:14,428 --> 00:16:16,115
Well, can it just be anywhere?

492
00:16:16,186 --> 00:16:18,177
Like...There?

493
00:16:20,126 --> 00:16:21,303
Good job, Pierce.

494
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:36,072
It's the first season of lost on DVD.

495
00:16:36,306 --> 00:16:38,032
That's the meaning of Christmas?

496
00:16:38,033 --> 00:16:39,389
No, it's a metaphor.

497
00:16:39,389 --> 00:16:40,784
It represents lack of payoff.

498
00:16:40,786 --> 00:16:41,989
Correct.

499
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:43,551
Thinking there was something you could do

500
00:16:43,552 --> 00:16:44,900
to save Christmas,

501
00:16:44,902 --> 00:16:47,317
turning yourself into an animated character

502
00:16:47,317 --> 00:16:49,113
in search of the holiday's meaning,

503
00:16:49,114 --> 00:16:53,136
these were mechanisms you used
to escape this.

504
00:16:54,298 --> 00:16:55,625
This Christmas card.

505
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,469
Left where you dropped it

506
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:59,165
on the floor of your dorm.

507
00:16:59,636 --> 00:17:00,785
"Abed,

508
00:17:00,832 --> 00:17:02,504
"I can't make it this year.

509
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,590
"I have a new family now.

510
00:17:04,846 --> 00:17:06,223
"You'll meet them one day.

511
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:07,862
"You're a man now.

512
00:17:08,263 --> 00:17:09,685
"Take care of dad.

513
00:17:10,246 --> 00:17:11,521
Wash your dupa."

514
00:17:12,249 --> 00:17:13,695
Mommy's moved on.

515
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:15,733
New family.

516
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:16,962
New life.

517
00:17:17,873 --> 00:17:19,201
There's nothing left to do now

518
00:17:19,202 --> 00:17:20,545
but heal.

519
00:17:20,636 --> 00:17:22,874
And share the experience

520
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:26,734
with as many reputable journals
as possible.

521
00:17:27,986 --> 00:17:28,871
Great.

522
00:17:28,872 --> 00:17:30,208
Look what you did to the kid.

523
00:17:30,209 --> 00:17:31,509
What's your article gonna be called?

524
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:32,463
"Worst shrink ever"?

525
00:17:32,464 --> 00:17:34,388
Hey, this is not my fault.

526
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:36,515
This is what Christmas does to people.

527
00:17:36,516 --> 00:17:38,209
We put too much meaning into it,

528
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:39,625
and it lets us down.

529
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:41,662
We beg to differ.

530
00:17:41,663 --> 00:17:42,884
What are you doing back here?

531
00:17:42,885 --> 00:17:44,435
Saving Christmas.

532
00:17:44,436 --> 00:17:47,934
Everybody point your magic Christmas
weapons at him.

533
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,134
Oh, brother.

534
00:17:50,134 --> 00:17:51,267
This is ridiculous.

535
00:17:51,268 --> 00:17:53,468
You are enabling a delusion.

536
00:17:53,469 --> 00:17:54,876
The delusion you're trying to cure

537
00:17:54,877 --> 00:17:57,060
is called Christmas, Duncan.

538
00:17:57,061 --> 00:17:58,192
It's the crazy notion

539
00:17:58,192 --> 00:18:00,839
that the longest, coldest, darkest nights

540
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,875
can be the warmest and brightest.

541
00:18:02,876 --> 00:18:05,228
Yeah, and when we all agree
to support each other

542
00:18:05,229 --> 00:18:06,490
in that insanity,

543
00:18:06,491 --> 00:18:08,976
something even crazier happens.

544
00:18:08,977 --> 00:18:10,482
It becomes true.

545
00:18:10,483 --> 00:18:12,040
Works every year.

546
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,230
Like clockwork.

547
00:18:13,231 --> 00:18:15,708
Try telling that to your catatonic friend.

548
00:18:15,709 --> 00:18:17,034
I got a better idea.

549
00:18:17,035 --> 00:18:18,872
Why don't we sing it?

550
00:18:18,873 --> 00:18:20,983
- Wait... what?
- Yeah, let's not go overboard.

551
00:18:20,984 --> 00:18:22,601
Will you two commit to something
for a change?

552
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,589
- Let's sing it.
- Yeah, let's sing.

553
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,484
Can we sing while we blow Duncan away?

554
00:18:26,486 --> 00:18:27,768
Absolutely.

555
00:18:27,769 --> 00:18:29,416
Ow! Ah, ah!

556
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:31,086

All right, all right. I'm leaving.

581
00:19:37,016 --> 00:19:39,373
Initiate self-destruct.

582
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,513
Don't you think that's a little bit...

583
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:53,763
I get it.

584
00:19:54,317 --> 00:19:55,970
The meaning of Christmas is...

585
00:19:56,127 --> 00:19:57,856
The idea that Christmas has meaning.

586
00:19:58,152 --> 00:19:59,700
And it can mean whatever we want.

587
00:19:59,909 --> 00:20:01,902
For me, it used to mean being with my mom.

588
00:20:02,775 --> 00:20:04,230
Now it means being with you guys.

589
00:20:06,442 --> 00:20:07,682
Thanks, lost.

590
00:20:13,914 --> 00:20:14,846
Wow.

591
00:20:15,154 --> 00:20:16,529
I feel so much better now.

592
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,653
I guess we don't need to be
stop-motion anymore.

593
00:20:18,657 --> 00:20:20,476
Well, why not just keep it going

594
00:20:20,477 --> 00:20:21,943
for the rest of Christmas?

595
00:20:22,353 --> 00:20:25,075
It just feels so right.

596
00:20:30,442 --> 00:20:32,241
You ever get the urge to just...

597
00:20:32,951 --> 00:20:34,538
"Merry Christmas!"

598
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:36,461
Ah, there.

599
00:20:36,461 --> 00:20:37,472
Said it.

600
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,042
We're stop-motion again.

601
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:54,468
Oh, don't worry, man. I did this.

602
00:20:54,469 --> 00:20:56,134
- You did?
- Yeah, it's cool.

603
00:20:56,135 --> 00:20:57,451
Oh. Why?

604
00:20:57,451 --> 00:20:59,134
Well, I always liked the way
fake food looked

605
00:20:59,135 --> 00:21:00,262
on those animated shows.

606
00:21:00,263 --> 00:21:02,330
I mean, get a load of these things.

607
00:21:02,332 --> 00:21:03,723
They really stepped up a notch

608
00:21:03,724 --> 00:21:05,317
in terms of visual deliciousness.

609
00:21:05,318 --> 00:21:06,097
I know what you mean.

610
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,410
Look at that perfect bite.

611
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:08,814
It's a little odd that I see this,
too, though,

612
00:21:08,815 --> 00:21:09,701
don't you think?

613
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:12,604
Yeah. We're weird that way.

614
00:21:14,301 --> 00:21:15,817
Ah, that's better.

615
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:17,148
So weird.

616
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,460
