1
00:00:01,129 --> 00:00:05,221
So according to the demonologist,
the gymnasium is clean.

2
00:00:05,383 --> 00:00:07,305
- We're running out of to-do stars.
- Yes.

3
00:00:07,469 --> 00:00:09,438
- Already dealt with.
- It's hard to believe.

4
00:00:09,596 --> 00:00:13,226
Somewhere along the way,
we started turning this school around.

5
00:00:16,895 --> 00:00:18,651
- The hell was that?
- What was what?

6
00:00:18,813 --> 00:00:20,320
Long, quiet lull. Don't like it.

7
00:00:20,482 --> 00:00:21,525
It's called contentment.

8
00:00:21,691 --> 00:00:23,661
Exactly.
Someone's always got a problem.

9
00:00:23,818 --> 00:00:27,959
I've got a problem. I don't like Abed's
problem with our lack of problems.

10
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:29,627
Okay.

11
00:00:29,782 --> 00:00:33,496
I commented on his commentary.
I just drew a circle around Abed, baby.

12
00:00:33,661 --> 00:00:37,090
"I don't think it's nice to pigeonhole
people's gimmicks."

13
00:00:37,248 --> 00:00:39,004
"You hear me, Two-Voice?"

14
00:00:39,167 --> 00:00:42,299
Abed, let us have a moment
of peace and stillness.

15
00:00:42,462 --> 00:00:44,182
They're kind of rare around here.

16
00:00:44,339 --> 00:00:47,138
- Calm before the storm.
- Says the storm generator.

17
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,305
All right, fine. Let's be content.

18
00:00:51,262 --> 00:00:54,560
Attention,
students and faculty of Greendale.

19
00:00:54,724 --> 00:00:57,441
I pressed this button on accident...

20
00:00:57,602 --> 00:00:59,572
...but might as well check in.
How are you?

21
00:01:00,021 --> 00:01:01,195
Fine.

22
00:01:01,898 --> 00:01:03,369
That's nice. I'm good too.

23
00:01:04,025 --> 00:01:05,366
I love you guys.

24
00:01:05,527 --> 00:01:08,291
We love you too.

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

26
00:01:35,807 --> 00:01:37,646
The information you've requested...

27
00:01:37,809 --> 00:01:39,944
Is on the Internet.

28
00:01:40,895 --> 00:01:42,568
School board, baby.

29
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,818
School board guys coming in.

30
00:01:44,983 --> 00:01:48,162
I would appreciate some knocking.
Do you know what goes on in here?

31
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:50,953
Heads-up. There's an insurance
appraiser coming tomorrow.

32
00:01:51,114 --> 00:01:54,578
Your ass is getting appraised,
insurance-style.

33
00:01:54,993 --> 00:01:57,674
- What does that mean?
- We hope it means we find out...

34
00:01:57,829 --> 00:02:01,044
...that your school
is very, very valuable to the city.

35
00:02:01,207 --> 00:02:03,888
Hey, how hilarious would that be?

36
00:02:04,419 --> 00:02:05,760
Are you guys drunk?

37
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,768
- Good luck proving it before we're not.
- Yeah.

38
00:02:11,259 --> 00:02:12,849
Pa-pa-papaya.

39
00:02:13,887 --> 00:02:15,014
Mango.

40
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,267
Strawberry.

41
00:02:18,558 --> 00:02:21,275
- Too ripe.
- You've been doing this for 30 minutes.

42
00:02:21,436 --> 00:02:24,698
So what?
I made all the vegetables disappear.

43
00:02:24,856 --> 00:02:26,943
A lot more than this happens
in 30 minutes.

44
00:02:27,108 --> 00:02:29,528
- We're relaxed and happy.
- I care more about this...

45
00:02:29,694 --> 00:02:33,040
- ...than anything I've ever cared about.
- Best $199 I've ever spent.

46
00:02:33,198 --> 00:02:34,455
It's 3 dollars.

47
00:02:34,616 --> 00:02:36,288
What are you playing?

48
00:02:36,451 --> 00:02:41,291
That's control software
for some kind of irrigation equipment.

49
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,297
It's fun.

50
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:45,297
Save Greendale Committee, unite.

51
00:02:45,585 --> 00:02:47,590
An insurance appraiser
is coming tomorrow...

52
00:02:47,754 --> 00:02:50,471
...to inspect the school.
If he doesn't appraise us good...

53
00:02:50,632 --> 00:02:52,304
...the school is doomed, doomed.

54
00:02:52,467 --> 00:02:55,813
- Call to adventure. Call to adventure.
- What's an insurance appraiser?

55
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:58,474
Something that sounds normal
and boring but is scary.

56
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,609
Like a raised mole
or a turkey deep fryer.

57
00:03:00,767 --> 00:03:03,104
Only one man qualified
to appraise insurance...

58
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:05,156
...and he died 2000 years ago
on a cross.

59
00:03:05,313 --> 00:03:08,113
I've seen insurance appraisers bleed.

60
00:03:08,274 --> 00:03:11,454
Their blood's different, darker.

61
00:03:11,611 --> 00:03:12,952
Everyone, take a breath.

62
00:03:13,112 --> 00:03:16,660
You're overreacting because this school
is addicted to crisis.

63
00:03:16,825 --> 00:03:20,336
You're like Hurricane Katrina dogs
that won't let anyone pet them anymore.

64
00:03:20,495 --> 00:03:23,674
But the weird thing
we need to get used to is this:

65
00:03:23,832 --> 00:03:25,255
The school's in decent shape.

66
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:27,801
This doesn't have to be a big deal.

67
00:03:27,961 --> 00:03:30,132
I wrote a paper on those dogs.

68
00:03:32,674 --> 00:03:36,351
We've worked hard all semester
to save this school.

69
00:03:36,511 --> 00:03:39,014
Truth is, we did.

70
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,224
So relax.

71
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,525
- Are you sure, Jeffrey?
- I promise.

72
00:03:42,725 --> 00:03:44,481
Heart's in the right place,
but he's wrong.

73
00:03:44,644 --> 00:03:47,776
Greendale is a crazy place where
crazy things happen. I have a plan.

74
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:50,026
Pretend we have a renowned
Physics Department.

75
00:03:50,191 --> 00:03:52,872
- Dean, start learning Swedish.
- I'll do my best.

76
00:03:53,027 --> 00:03:55,578
Hickey, you keep in touch
with any criminals you busted?

77
00:03:55,738 --> 00:03:57,660
- Five.
- Get them for costume measurements.

78
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:00,374
We need to make a particle accelerator
out of boxes.

79
00:04:00,535 --> 00:04:03,038
Nope. Nobody do any of that.
Abed, outside.

80
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:09,046
- There is no story.
- Everything's a story, Jeff.

81
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:11,381
Getting out of bed is a story.
This is a story.

82
00:04:11,546 --> 00:04:14,429
Study room, we're content.
I'm concerned. Skip fruit-matching.

83
00:04:14,591 --> 00:04:16,477
Dean enters with the insurance story.

84
00:04:16,634 --> 00:04:17,678
Call, refusal.

85
00:04:17,844 --> 00:04:20,774
You're dragging me across a threshold
demanding there be no story.

86
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,232
Puts me into a world
I'm gonna have to adapt to.

87
00:04:23,391 --> 00:04:25,230
You have to do it by yourself, please.

88
00:04:25,393 --> 00:04:27,564
Okay?
Because if this appraisal is a story...

89
00:04:27,729 --> 00:04:30,410
...that means we're in trouble,
and we are not in trouble.

90
00:04:30,565 --> 00:04:31,822
Because if we are...

91
00:04:33,109 --> 00:04:34,153
No more stories.

92
00:04:35,904 --> 00:04:38,537
So we'll see you later.

93
00:04:38,907 --> 00:04:40,248
After no story.

94
00:04:40,408 --> 00:04:41,998
No story.

95
00:04:43,578 --> 00:04:45,215
So be it.

96
00:04:45,371 --> 00:04:47,840
Let the lack of story...

97
00:05:06,768 --> 00:05:08,239
Hey.

98
00:05:08,394 --> 00:05:10,446
Oh, put one trap behind each cabinet.

99
00:05:10,605 --> 00:05:13,405
Although, I think we're good.
The cafeteria food killed...

100
00:05:13,566 --> 00:05:16,699
- ...most of the roaches anyway.
- Hey, check it out.

101
00:05:16,986 --> 00:05:20,617
- Is this a wedding ring?
- Are you kidding? What...?

102
00:05:22,075 --> 00:05:24,210
I lost this my first week here.

103
00:05:24,369 --> 00:05:26,789
Oh, who's the lucky...?

104
00:05:27,705 --> 00:05:29,876
It's my mom's.
I started wearing it because...

105
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:33,635
...I don't know, everybody dreams
of settling down, right?

106
00:05:35,046 --> 00:05:37,894
And because it fits.
She had huge fingers for a woman.

107
00:05:38,049 --> 00:05:40,185
Part of what killed her, really.

108
00:05:40,802 --> 00:05:42,558
I'm not dreaming about settling down.

109
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,935
Well, maybe you already have.
You're teaching, and you like it.

110
00:05:46,099 --> 00:05:49,361
- You love Greendale.
- No, I love Scotch and myself.

111
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:51,156
I tolerate Greendale.

112
00:05:51,312 --> 00:05:53,863
It's a good school.
There's no need to get sentimental.

113
00:05:54,023 --> 00:05:56,823
This is going to be
the most boring thing to happen here...

114
00:05:56,985 --> 00:05:59,321
...since Britta dated Troy.

115
00:05:59,487 --> 00:06:01,575
All right, no story.

116
00:06:02,157 --> 00:06:03,248
Wait.

117
00:06:03,408 --> 00:06:05,627
If there's no story,
what am I explaining?

118
00:06:05,785 --> 00:06:07,707
I'm in a story.

119
00:06:08,329 --> 00:06:10,002
Okay, think, Abed, think.

120
00:06:10,165 --> 00:06:12,419
How do you shake a story?

121
00:06:14,002 --> 00:06:18,178
The answer is in the teacher's lounge.

122
00:06:23,428 --> 00:06:26,145
Oh, hey, Janelle, how are you?

123
00:06:30,226 --> 00:06:32,029
- Here he comes, here he comes.
- Okay.

124
00:06:34,022 --> 00:06:36,821
Hi, my name is Ronald Mohammed.
Go ahead, heard them all.

125
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:38,989
The city of Greendale
has sent me here...

126
00:06:39,152 --> 00:06:42,082
...to assess
this campus's level of liability.

127
00:06:42,238 --> 00:06:44,041
Now, what do I mean by liability?

128
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:47,212
Well, the city defines liability
as any asserted...

129
00:06:47,368 --> 00:06:51,081
...or non-asserted perturbation
by any qualifying party.

130
00:06:51,247 --> 00:06:54,545
What's a party? A party is a person
or a group of persons...

131
00:06:54,709 --> 00:06:58,719
...or an event celebrating a person
or a party of persons' birth, marriage...

132
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,303
Don't panic, Jeffrey.

133
00:07:01,841 --> 00:07:03,977
I'm fine.
I'm the only one who's not panicking.

134
00:07:04,135 --> 00:07:06,555
Please. You can lie to yourself,
but don't lie to me.

135
00:07:06,721 --> 00:07:08,857
But the city defines a dog...

136
00:07:09,015 --> 00:07:11,898
...as any living entity
with four legs and a tail.

137
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,863
So raccoons, bears...

138
00:07:14,229 --> 00:07:17,906
...mountain lions, mice,
these are all just different sizes of dog.

139
00:07:18,066 --> 00:07:19,276
What do I mean by size?

140
00:07:19,442 --> 00:07:21,743
- Tell you a story.
- What's that supposed to mean?

141
00:07:21,903 --> 00:07:24,157
I know how much you feel
for the campus, Jeff.

142
00:07:24,322 --> 00:07:25,710
How much you feel in general.

143
00:07:25,865 --> 00:07:29,496
And I know you think it's a weakness,
but believe me, it's your strength.

144
00:07:29,661 --> 00:07:32,758
- You got something in your teeth.
- You got something in your chest.

145
00:07:32,914 --> 00:07:36,757
Four hundred thousand gallons
of liquefied horse meat.

146
00:07:38,795 --> 00:07:40,266
Here I come.

147
00:07:50,557 --> 00:07:52,110
Just...

148
00:07:53,685 --> 00:07:57,232
And you shall find that salt is the taste
of another man's bread...

149
00:07:57,397 --> 00:08:00,695
...and hard is the way up and down
another man's stairs.

150
00:08:00,859 --> 00:08:02,531
Dante. Let's proceed.

151
00:08:15,748 --> 00:08:18,334
No! It's always a story.

152
00:08:18,501 --> 00:08:20,471
Everything is a story.

153
00:08:20,628 --> 00:08:22,384
Wait, wait, wait. Story feeds on conflict.

154
00:08:22,547 --> 00:08:25,644
If I stop resisting,
it'll stop being a story.

155
00:08:26,718 --> 00:08:28,224
No, Abed.

156
00:08:29,637 --> 00:08:30,681
Me with a beard?

157
00:08:30,847 --> 00:08:32,021
Keep fighting the story.

158
00:08:32,182 --> 00:08:34,436
Keep fighting it until it falls apart.

159
00:08:34,601 --> 00:08:35,988
I'm right.

160
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:40,492
I mean, I'm wrong.
I mean, I'm right. I mean, I'm wrong.

161
00:08:40,648 --> 00:08:42,985
I mean, I'm right. I mean, I'm wrong.

162
00:08:43,151 --> 00:08:44,871
I mean, I'm right. I mean, I'm wrong.

163
00:08:45,028 --> 00:08:47,614
Unsubscribe.

164
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,702
For the final stage of my appraisal...

165
00:08:49,866 --> 00:08:52,666
...I'm gonna randomly select
one of your vending machines...

166
00:08:52,827 --> 00:08:55,247
...to see if it can be rocked
using human strength...

167
00:08:55,413 --> 00:08:56,920
...enough to tip and crush me.

168
00:08:57,207 --> 00:08:58,678
Now, in the U.S., each year...

169
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,221
...six people die this way...

170
00:09:00,376 --> 00:09:02,512
...and five of them
are insurance appraisers...

171
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:05,174
...so I take this very seriously.
Here we go.

172
00:09:20,355 --> 00:09:22,691
- Okay.
- Sorry we're late.

173
00:09:22,857 --> 00:09:24,945
Hey, look. It's Ronald Mohammed.

174
00:09:25,109 --> 00:09:26,320
How about that name?

175
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:29,332
All right, what's the damage?

176
00:09:29,489 --> 00:09:33,202
How much is this scampy little hole
in the earth gonna cost us this year?

177
00:09:33,368 --> 00:09:37,840
Well, your gas leak is repaired, all
your fire exits actually lead outside...

178
00:09:37,997 --> 00:09:41,841
...and I am told that no new species
have been discovered here in a week.

179
00:09:42,001 --> 00:09:45,383
I have to say, I was brought in here
to estimate Greendale's liability...

180
00:09:45,547 --> 00:09:49,390
...but at this point in time, I'd describe
this campus as an actual property asset.

181
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:54,067
This property has value.

182
00:09:55,223 --> 00:09:56,730
Oh, yeah!

183
00:09:57,142 --> 00:09:59,360
Best news ever.

184
00:10:05,567 --> 00:10:07,572
- This property has value.
- It has value.

185
00:10:07,735 --> 00:10:10,204
- That means we can sell it.
- We can finally sell it.

186
00:10:10,363 --> 00:10:11,751
Wait, wait, wait.

187
00:10:11,906 --> 00:10:13,746
Press stop on Dave Matthews.

188
00:10:15,076 --> 00:10:17,081
- What?
- We can start courting businesses...

189
00:10:17,245 --> 00:10:19,416
...to unload this school
on the private sector.

190
00:10:19,581 --> 00:10:20,708
What do you mean?

191
00:10:20,874 --> 00:10:24,088
This is a huge chunk of real estate,
which generates no tax revenue...

192
00:10:24,252 --> 00:10:26,672
...and takes money
from the Education budget.

193
00:10:26,838 --> 00:10:28,760
That's because
it's a community college.

194
00:10:28,923 --> 00:10:32,601
Well, excuse us for taking longer
to see that was the problem.

195
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,647
Maybe we're not as smart as you.

196
00:10:34,804 --> 00:10:36,525
I mean, we only went to Yale.

197
00:10:36,681 --> 00:10:38,437
Oh, no, you didn't.

198
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,613
- Yes, I did.
- We should call T.J.Maxx right away.

199
00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:43,775
Dude, I told you. This jacket looks fine.

200
00:10:43,938 --> 00:10:46,157
No, to talk about selling this place.

201
00:10:46,316 --> 00:10:49,662
Oh, right. Yeah, T.J.Maxx, Marshalls.
What about Ben & Jerry's?

202
00:10:49,819 --> 00:10:53,829
Oh, Richie, you're my friend,
but that is the last thing you need.

203
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,291
Tough love received, bro.

204
00:10:58,703 --> 00:11:02,085
I did it. This school is story-free.
We can be content now forever.

205
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,801
Let me be one of the six this year.

206
00:11:12,091 --> 00:11:15,390
Craig. Craig, this vending machine
is not gonna tip over and crush you.

207
00:11:15,553 --> 00:11:17,143
Why not? Why?

208
00:11:17,305 --> 00:11:21,398
Because we fixed it
when we saved Greendale.

209
00:11:26,147 --> 00:11:28,484
We saved Greendale.

210
00:11:30,193 --> 00:11:32,328
And now they're gonna sell it.

211
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:45,334
If I come over there...

212
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,676
...there are gonna be two sounds:
me hitting you twice.

213
00:11:54,592 --> 00:11:58,021
Hello, Greendale, as you know,
our school will soon be replaced...

214
00:11:58,179 --> 00:11:59,520
...by a sandwich university.

215
00:11:59,681 --> 00:12:02,101
However,
every ending is also a beginning.

216
00:12:03,476 --> 00:12:05,362
Sure, things may look bad now...

217
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:09,400
...some of us may have no idea
where we're going or what to do, but...

218
00:12:10,775 --> 00:12:12,827
Okay, okay,
I should've written this out.

219
00:12:12,986 --> 00:12:15,869
I thought I'd be able to come up
with something on the fly.

220
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:21,797
Moving on to phase two,
the actual saving of Greendale.

221
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:23,414
Annie...

222
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,510
I've generated a few ideas
involving social media...

223
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:29,679
- ...that I think might do the trick.
- Annie...

224
00:12:29,836 --> 00:12:32,968
You want us to tweet "Savegreendale"?
I'm sorry, Annie.

225
00:12:33,131 --> 00:12:36,559
The reason I have 48 followers
is that I don't exploit them.

226
00:12:36,718 --> 00:12:39,601
They come to me for atheistic rants
and photos of my meals...

227
00:12:39,762 --> 00:12:41,565
...not this obnoxiousness.

228
00:12:41,723 --> 00:12:45,151
We need to make people aware
that Greendale exists and needs help.

229
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:47,315
- Why?
- Because once the Internet...

230
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:49,982
- ...knows about something, it changes.
- Right.

231
00:12:50,148 --> 00:12:52,153
Just ask Chris Brown or China.

232
00:12:54,486 --> 00:12:56,241
Jeff, you made Annie cry.

233
00:12:56,404 --> 00:13:00,794
Well, if it's any consolation, this is
the last time that will ever happen.

234
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:04,211
I know how to save Greendale.

235
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:07,254
Treasure. Buried treasure.

236
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:09,460
Okay, I'm tapped.

237
00:13:10,668 --> 00:13:15,094
We all wish we could do something,
Annie, but I think that concludes...

238
00:13:15,256 --> 00:13:18,768
...the last meeting
of the Save Greendale Committee...

239
00:13:19,093 --> 00:13:21,348
...the committee that did its darnedest.

240
00:13:21,513 --> 00:13:24,941
Wait! Are we sure we can't stop
the school from being sold to Subway?

241
00:13:25,099 --> 00:13:26,274
I'm afraid so, Chang.

242
00:13:26,601 --> 00:13:29,780
Okay, I just wanted to make sure.

243
00:13:31,898 --> 00:13:34,828
Screw you, guys. It's time to get paid.

244
00:13:45,912 --> 00:13:50,088
Chang just unexpectedly
betrayed the group for the last time.

245
00:13:54,629 --> 00:13:57,346
Greendale's gonna make
a great Subway Sandwich University.

246
00:13:57,507 --> 00:13:59,346
Research shows
most of your graduates...

247
00:13:59,509 --> 00:14:03,934
- ...end up working for our restaurants.
- By design. We're proud of our school.

248
00:14:04,097 --> 00:14:05,271
Proud of Subway School.

249
00:14:05,431 --> 00:14:06,985
This campus is yours now.

250
00:14:07,142 --> 00:14:10,772
If you wanna dynamite it, all we ask
is that you let us light the fuse.

251
00:14:10,937 --> 00:14:12,657
Yeah, we hate this place.

252
00:14:12,814 --> 00:14:15,697
- You just said you were proud of it.
- Proud of its potential.

253
00:14:15,859 --> 00:14:17,116
Love its potential.

254
00:14:17,277 --> 00:14:19,531
This'll be your office.

255
00:14:20,905 --> 00:14:23,670
Why?

256
00:14:24,033 --> 00:14:26,916
Okay, we'll check in on that later.

257
00:14:27,078 --> 00:14:29,498
What, can't wait
until Greendale's corpse is cold...

258
00:14:29,664 --> 00:14:31,669
...before you put it
on a 6-inch white bun?

259
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,340
Young lady, that's not fair.

260
00:14:33,501 --> 00:14:36,384
Subway doesn't call its bread "buns,"
and we don't serve white.

261
00:14:36,546 --> 00:14:38,053
We serve Italian, honey oat...

262
00:14:38,214 --> 00:14:40,895
- ...nine-grain wheat.
- Thanks for making my joke accurate.

263
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:43,305
- Now it's hilarious.
- Classes are over, kids.

264
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,941
We're helping the dean pack.

265
00:14:45,096 --> 00:14:47,101
This is still Greendale for two hours.

266
00:14:47,265 --> 00:14:48,357
Enjoy it.

267
00:14:51,769 --> 00:14:55,198
Wait. You don't call your bread "buns."
What do you call them?

268
00:14:55,648 --> 00:14:56,692
Bread.

269
00:14:57,859 --> 00:15:01,453
Bread is a substance. What do you call
the units of bread you use, "breads"?

270
00:15:07,702 --> 00:15:09,043
You okay?

271
00:15:09,204 --> 00:15:10,497
I just wish we had more time.

272
00:15:10,663 --> 00:15:13,048
I could turn things around, I swear.
Look.

273
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:17,550
I got one of these label things.
I mean, it makes custom labels.

274
00:15:18,755 --> 00:15:22,682
This was gonna help me
get organised.

275
00:15:26,137 --> 00:15:28,392
Where should we start?
Pack up these pictures?

276
00:15:28,556 --> 00:15:30,478
They're not really mine.

277
00:15:30,642 --> 00:15:32,896
They're Greendale history.

278
00:15:33,061 --> 00:15:35,742
Here's our 1987 civil rights march.

279
00:15:35,897 --> 00:15:39,491
This was when we started offering
Photoshop classes.

280
00:15:39,651 --> 00:15:42,415
And that's Russell Borchert.

281
00:15:43,071 --> 00:15:45,076
Borchert, Borchert, loved computers...

282
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,380
Yes, yes, "More than women's butts
or hooters." Very mature, you two.

283
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:51,798
Was there any truth to that legend?

284
00:15:51,955 --> 00:15:54,375
The legend
that a Greendale computer professor...

285
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,094
...made love to a computer...

286
00:15:56,251 --> 00:15:58,837
...and died of the first computer virus?
Sure.

287
00:15:59,003 --> 00:16:02,385
The truth is,
Greendale had a computer professor.

288
00:16:02,549 --> 00:16:04,803
By the way,
he was a millionaire and a genius.

289
00:16:04,968 --> 00:16:08,396
He has sex with one computer,
and that's his legacy?

290
00:16:08,555 --> 00:16:11,105
So after all my work,
how will I be remembered?

291
00:16:11,266 --> 00:16:13,686
The bald dean with glasses, I guess.

292
00:16:13,852 --> 00:16:16,188
You aware
there's an engraved plate on this, says:

293
00:16:16,354 --> 00:16:19,451
- "The truth is behind this picture"?
- Of course. I'm not an idiot.

294
00:16:20,108 --> 00:16:22,077
Whoa, wait. It meant literally?

295
00:16:22,235 --> 00:16:23,789
What is it?

296
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,881
You were teaching
Fundamentals of Law?

297
00:16:39,043 --> 00:16:40,087
Yeah.

298
00:16:40,253 --> 00:16:43,931
Think you could make the transition
to teaching Sandwich Law?

299
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:47,721
It's essentially the same, I'm sure,
just a bit more focused.

300
00:16:48,511 --> 00:16:49,899
Here.

301
00:16:50,054 --> 00:16:51,561
That's a Subway black card.

302
00:16:51,723 --> 00:16:54,820
It entitles you to
5-dollar footlongs for life.

303
00:16:56,019 --> 00:16:57,490
For life, Mr. Winger.

304
00:16:58,021 --> 00:16:59,824
For life.

305
00:17:14,496 --> 00:17:16,465
- Hey.
- Hey.

306
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:21,430
So, what are you gonna do?

307
00:17:21,586 --> 00:17:23,840
I'm thinking I'm gonna transfer
to city college...

308
00:17:24,005 --> 00:17:26,306
...but I'm knowing
I'm gonna be a bartender.

309
00:17:26,466 --> 00:17:27,676
You?

310
00:17:27,842 --> 00:17:30,476
- Subway offered me a job.
- Nice.

311
00:17:32,013 --> 00:17:35,311
I'm worried about Abed and Annie.
They're not ready for this to end.

312
00:17:35,475 --> 00:17:37,943
They're part of the
adulthood-begins-at-30 generation.

313
00:17:38,102 --> 00:17:39,526
And I'm...

314
00:17:39,687 --> 00:17:41,942
I'm actually looking forward
to a little bit of...

315
00:17:42,106 --> 00:17:44,194
- Sanity?
- Yes. Sanity.

316
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:48,036
Yeah. I mean, it's over,
but on the other hand, it's over.

317
00:17:48,196 --> 00:17:52,502
Amen. And to think this all started
because you wanted to...

318
00:17:52,659 --> 00:17:53,702
Nail you.

319
00:17:53,868 --> 00:17:55,458
Yeah, I regret nothing.

320
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:59,001
Don't. I mean, after everything
that has happened here...

321
00:17:59,165 --> 00:18:03,128
...what did either of us
really get done aside from each other?

322
00:18:03,294 --> 00:18:08,348
Exactly. And what are either of us
gonna be leaving with?

323
00:18:15,557 --> 00:18:20,812
I should go clean out my locker,
she said at the age of 33.

324
00:18:23,565 --> 00:18:24,692
Let's get married.

325
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,621
- What?
- Yeah, right?

326
00:18:27,777 --> 00:18:30,577
I mean, this is what matters, isn't it?

327
00:18:30,738 --> 00:18:33,075
This is what keeps this all
from being pointless.

328
00:18:33,241 --> 00:18:36,919
Let's do what people do. Get a house we
can't afford, a dog that makes us angry.

329
00:18:37,078 --> 00:18:39,249
Dedicate an entire cabinet
to grocery bags...

330
00:18:39,414 --> 00:18:41,715
...realise we have a favourite brand
of olive oil?

331
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,216
Yes. Marry me.

332
00:18:43,376 --> 00:18:45,428
Okay, yeah.

333
00:18:48,923 --> 00:18:51,688
Yeah. Yeah, this feels right.

334
00:18:51,843 --> 00:18:54,560
Let's get out of here
and never look back.

335
00:18:54,721 --> 00:18:57,189
First, let's lock these doors
and pull these shades.

336
00:18:57,348 --> 00:19:01,061
- We've never had sex on the new table.
- Yes, two for two.

337
00:19:01,603 --> 00:19:03,524
Medium roughness, high tempo?

338
00:19:03,688 --> 00:19:05,242
Let's make it a number eight.

339
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:11,447
Buried treasure!

340
00:19:11,613 --> 00:19:14,412
Buried treasure!
Lock the doors, close the blinds.

341
00:19:15,116 --> 00:19:18,295
We could save Greendale, Jeff.

342
00:19:18,453 --> 00:19:22,084
There may be treasure on campus.

343
00:19:22,248 --> 00:19:24,088
Hidden, buried treasure.

344
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,670
Treasure!
We need to call an emergency meeting...

345
00:19:26,836 --> 00:19:29,137
...somewhere safe
where no one can hear or see...

346
00:19:29,297 --> 00:19:31,385
...because we have to
keep this a secret...

347
00:19:31,549 --> 00:19:36,555
...because it's a buried treasure!

348
00:19:36,721 --> 00:19:38,144
Buried treasure!

349
00:19:38,306 --> 00:19:42,945
Buried treasure,
buried treasure, buried treasure.

350
00:19:43,102 --> 00:19:46,116
Buried treasure, buried treasure,
buried treasure.

351
00:19:46,731 --> 00:19:48,736
Buried treasure, buried treasure.

352
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,992
Interesting.

353
00:19:50,693 --> 00:19:53,411
Emergency meeting.

354
00:19:58,451 --> 00:20:00,539
And that's how
I ended up at Greendale.

355
00:20:00,703 --> 00:20:03,337
Isn't it strange how it took
this school shutting down...

356
00:20:03,498 --> 00:20:05,337
...for you and I to know each other?

357
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,256
- What's up next for you?
- Don't know.

358
00:20:07,418 --> 00:20:09,922
Maybe go stay with family
in Lincolnshire.

359
00:20:10,088 --> 00:20:11,511
- Lincolnshire?
- Yeah.

360
00:20:11,673 --> 00:20:14,935
- Where in Lincolnshire?
- Just a little town called Scunthorpe.

361
00:20:15,093 --> 00:20:17,679
Scunthorpe?
I was stationed around Scunthorpe.

362
00:20:17,846 --> 00:20:18,973
- No.
- Oh, wait, wait.

363
00:20:19,806 --> 00:20:23,863
O'er the lady's smocks I tarry

364
00:20:24,018 --> 00:20:26,699
Through the hollyhocks and glen

365
00:20:26,855 --> 00:20:29,820
For a piss and a thrush
In Scunthorpe

366
00:20:29,983 --> 00:20:33,032
- Then it's off to Henningpen
- Then it's off to Henningpen

367
00:20:33,778 --> 00:20:35,036
I love that.

368
00:20:35,196 --> 00:20:37,700
Oh, where in God's name
did you learn that song?

369
00:20:37,866 --> 00:20:40,202
- In Stainsbury Pub.
- My family practically lived...

370
00:20:40,368 --> 00:20:43,216
- ...in Stainsbury's.
- I lost my virginity at Stainsbury's.

371
00:20:43,371 --> 00:20:45,542
My mother was a Stainsbury whore.

372
00:20:52,422 --> 00:20:54,308
Mine was missing a thumb.

373
00:20:54,466 --> 00:20:56,684
Oh, my God.

374
00:20:59,053 --> 00:21:00,893
- Two thumbs, she got both.
- Two thumbs.

375
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:05,445
I mean,
you may have slept with my aunt...

376
00:21:05,602 --> 00:21:08,319
...but given the circumstances, cheers.

377
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,235
- Cheers, yeah.
- Yeah.

378
00:21:11,232 --> 00:21:14,744
So you're gonna stay with your family
till you get your bearings?

379
00:21:14,903 --> 00:21:17,999
I've got a cousin, Clive,
who's got a spare room.

380
00:21:18,156 --> 00:21:20,208
- You and he would really get along.
- Really?

381
00:21:20,366 --> 00:21:21,790
Yeah.

382
00:21:22,305 --> 00:21:28,309
