2
00:00:08,556 --> 00:00:09,651
mmm.

3
00:00:09,705 --> 00:00:10,783
Ugh.

4
00:00:10,807 --> 00:00:12,141
Hot 'n' brown's coffee
really wakes me up

5
00:00:12,142 --> 00:00:13,776
to the fact
that its coffee sucks.

6
00:00:13,777 --> 00:00:15,511
I miss having a coffee shop.

7
00:00:15,512 --> 00:00:17,063
Now where am I going
to get my cappuccinos

8
00:00:17,064 --> 00:00:18,898
and Sarah McLachlan CDs?

9
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:20,516
It wasn't that great.
If had this space,

10
00:00:20,517 --> 00:00:22,685
I would have served fresh fruit
and sandwiches,

11
00:00:22,686 --> 00:00:23,852
and I would've got rid

12
00:00:23,853 --> 00:00:25,187
of that take-a-penny,
leave-a-penny nonsense.

13
00:00:25,188 --> 00:00:26,539
If the good lord wanted you
to have a penny,

14
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,491
- you'd have one.
- Pierce...

15
00:00:28,492 --> 00:00:31,527
Why do you look
like a wealthy murderer?

16
00:00:31,528 --> 00:00:33,079
I look like an entrepreneur.

17
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,198
Now that my dad's gone, I'm
expanding Hawthorne industries

18
00:00:36,199 --> 00:00:39,051
by investing in new products.

19
00:00:39,052 --> 00:00:42,538
- Like... these.
- What's that?

20
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:43,806
It's an automatic
security camera

21
00:00:43,807 --> 00:00:45,841
that can tell your friends
from intruders.

22
00:00:45,842 --> 00:00:47,209
How does it work?

23
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,211
Your guests have arrived.

24
00:00:49,212 --> 00:00:52,348
Threat level four.

25
00:00:52,349 --> 00:00:53,566
Your guests have arrived.

26
00:00:53,567 --> 00:00:55,217
It's not calibrated.

27
00:00:55,218 --> 00:00:58,367
Wireless racism.
The future of the past is now.

28
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:00,773
Why don't you put your money
into a good idea, like Shirley?

29
00:01:00,774 --> 00:01:02,575
Oh, I made that offer
the first day I met her.

30
00:01:02,576 --> 00:01:04,059
She almost broke my nose.

31
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,361
I mean, Shirley's good
with food,

32
00:01:05,362 --> 00:01:08,281
you have capital,
and Greendale has real estate.

33
00:01:08,282 --> 00:01:09,665
What are you talking about,
Britta?

34
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:11,334
I'm talking about
the whole reason you came here...

35
00:01:11,335 --> 00:01:13,119
- To start a business.
- Hmm.

36
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,670
What do you think, Shirley?

37
00:01:14,671 --> 00:01:16,905
Should I have my people
call your people?

38
00:01:16,906 --> 00:01:19,458
I mean, not <i>your</i> people.

39
00:01:19,459 --> 00:01:21,410
I could think about it.

A vision in hyper color
and hammer pants.

53
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:54,276
Baby girl, I have loved you ever
since there was a Soviet union

- and only one Damon Wayans.
- Oh.

I've made mistakes,

00:02:02,452 --> 00:02:05,101
something important,
that we keep putting off.

It's cool that Andre and Shirley
are getting married again.

71
00:02:52,899 --> 00:02:54,942
There's a whole generation of viewers
that didn't get to see the original.

72
00:02:54,943 --> 00:02:57,223
Let's hope it's more of
a bale than a Kilmer situation.

73
00:02:57,224 --> 00:02:58,974
Second weddings are okay,
I guess.

74
00:02:58,975 --> 00:03:00,476
If I had to rank 'em, uh...

75
00:03:00,477 --> 00:03:02,912
It would go
fourth, seventh, second,

76
00:03:02,913 --> 00:03:05,281
fifth, first, third, sixth.

77
00:03:05,282 --> 00:03:07,433
- No, wait... first then fifth.
- Got it...

78
00:03:07,434 --> 00:03:09,635
Fourth, seventh, second, first,
fifth, third, sixth.

79
00:03:09,636 --> 00:03:11,787
When's our culture gonna
outgrow this wedding thing?

80
00:03:11,788 --> 00:03:13,522
You're anti-wedding, now?

81
00:03:13,523 --> 00:03:15,046
No, she's just pro-anti.

82
00:03:15,047 --> 00:03:16,625
No to everything you both said.

83
00:03:16,626 --> 00:03:18,861
Weddings are like little girls'
tea parties,

84
00:03:18,862 --> 00:03:20,529
except the women
are the stuffed animals,

85
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,498
the men are making them talk,

86
00:03:22,499 --> 00:03:23,833
and they're not drinking tea,

87
00:03:23,834 --> 00:03:25,868
they're drinking
antiquated gender roles.

88
00:03:25,869 --> 00:03:27,853
Somebody tell Britta
what an analogy is.

89
00:03:27,854 --> 00:03:29,371
I know what it is.

90
00:03:29,372 --> 00:03:33,208
It's like a thought
with another thought's hat on.

91
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:34,543
Hmm.

92
00:03:34,544 --> 00:03:36,562
Look, I can't get behind
this marriage thing, either.

93
00:03:36,563 --> 00:03:37,847
It was invented back

94
00:03:37,848 --> 00:03:39,765
when "till death"
meant "till your first cold."

95
00:03:39,766 --> 00:03:42,218
I mean, life's too long
to spend it with someone else.

96
00:03:42,219 --> 00:03:44,070
- It's a sucker's game.
- It's a mutual cop out.

97
00:03:44,071 --> 00:03:46,772
I mean, just nut up
and die alone.

98
00:03:46,773 --> 00:03:48,441
- Mmm.
- Hello.

99
00:03:48,442 --> 00:03:50,342
Oh, my God, we're so happy
for you!

100
00:03:50,343 --> 00:03:52,244
- You are glowing.
- I know, isn't it exciting?

101
00:03:52,245 --> 00:03:53,863
The rehearsal is in two days,

102
00:03:53,864 --> 00:03:54,997
and the wedding
is the day after that,

103
00:03:54,998 --> 00:03:56,231
on our anniversary.

104
00:03:56,232 --> 00:03:57,566
And I'm sure you all
can make it,

105
00:03:57,567 --> 00:03:59,298
because you're already here.

106
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:00,800
You're having your wedding
in the study room?

107
00:04:00,801 --> 00:04:01,904
Our church has certain policies

108
00:04:01,905 --> 00:04:04,073
regarding things
like second weddings,

109
00:04:04,074 --> 00:04:05,791
and tight jeans and...

110
00:04:05,792 --> 00:04:07,176
Calico cats.

111
00:04:07,177 --> 00:04:09,211
Um, Jeff, I was wondering
if you would do us the honor

112
00:04:09,212 --> 00:04:11,363
of giving a toast
at our wedding?

113
00:04:11,364 --> 00:04:12,515
Good idea!

114
00:04:12,516 --> 00:04:14,650
Jeff has a lot of thoughts
about marriage.

115
00:04:14,651 --> 00:04:16,018
I would be honored.

116
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,420
Shirley, do you need
any help with your wedding?

117
00:04:18,421 --> 00:04:19,672
This probably sounds silly,

118
00:04:19,673 --> 00:04:21,690
but every time I see
a wedding idea I like,

119
00:04:21,691 --> 00:04:22,942
I put it in a little scrapbook.

120
00:04:22,943 --> 00:04:25,628
Oh, that's nice.
Ooh.

121
00:04:25,629 --> 00:04:26,862
We can help too.
We just saw

122
00:04:26,863 --> 00:04:28,263
the <i>inspector spacetime
wedding episode,</i>

123
00:04:28,264 --> 00:04:29,815
so we know what pitfalls
to avoid.

124
00:04:29,816 --> 00:04:31,784
Be sure to get a DNA reading
of your prospective mate.

125
00:04:31,785 --> 00:04:33,791
Inspector spacetime ended up
marrying himself as a baby.

126
00:04:33,792 --> 00:04:34,954
I think I got this.

127
00:04:34,955 --> 00:04:36,906
Everyone just come and...

128
00:04:36,907 --> 00:04:39,942
Relax and behave normally.

129
00:04:45,179 --> 00:04:47,600
That's the noise people make
when they're offended

130
00:04:47,601 --> 00:04:48,784
in all the movies
that Annie rents.

131
00:04:48,785 --> 00:04:50,469
We'll try not to embarrass you

132
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,588
at your community college
library wedding.

133
00:04:52,589 --> 00:04:53,956
- Thank you.
- Oh, Shirley,

134
00:04:53,957 --> 00:04:55,641
I managed to set up a meeting
with the Dean,

135
00:04:55,642 --> 00:04:57,691
so we can pitch him
our sandwich shop idea.

136
00:04:57,692 --> 00:04:59,693
I've already registered
a website...

137
00:04:59,694 --> 00:05:04,850
It's, uh, h-t-t-p, colon,
forward slash, forward slash,

138
00:05:04,851 --> 00:05:07,586
w-w-w, period,
members, period,

139
00:05:07,587 --> 00:05:11,079
webplicity custom sites...
All one word... period,

140
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,025
- c-o...
- Oh, I don't know, Pierce.

141
00:05:13,026 --> 00:05:15,211
I'm way too busy for that now
with the wedding and everything.

142
00:05:15,212 --> 00:05:16,712
Bye-bye, everybody.

143
00:05:16,713 --> 00:05:18,831
- I have to practice my walk.
- Ooh.

144
00:05:21,418 --> 00:05:22,585
Great.

145
00:05:22,586 --> 00:05:24,968
Another business venture
down the toilet.

146
00:05:24,969 --> 00:05:27,723
No problem,
I've still got plan "C."

147
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:31,493
Ladies and gentlemen,
the trouser bench.

148
00:05:35,832 --> 00:05:37,983
For the man on the go
who makes frequent stops.

149
00:05:40,237 --> 00:05:43,606
Will somebody please call
all the ambulances?

150
00:05:43,607 --> 00:05:44,773
I can't believe Shirley.

151
00:05:44,774 --> 00:05:45,958
We should show up
at this wedding

152
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:47,276
and be the most normal people
in the world.

153
00:05:47,277 --> 00:05:48,510
Yeah, I could go as normal man

154
00:05:48,511 --> 00:05:50,062
and you could be
my trusty sidekick ordinario.

155
00:05:50,063 --> 00:05:52,781
No.
That's already weird.

156
00:05:52,782 --> 00:05:54,149
We'd be playing into her hand.

157
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:57,403
We should just show up
wearing boring gray suits

158
00:05:57,404 --> 00:06:00,122
with gray ties and gray shirts.

159
00:06:00,123 --> 00:06:01,574
We could dye our hair gray.

160
00:06:01,575 --> 00:06:03,826
And then we could lay down on
the sidewalk and be invisible.

161
00:06:03,827 --> 00:06:05,461
You know,
maybe Shirley's got a point.

162
00:06:05,462 --> 00:06:07,246
I have an idea.

163
00:06:07,247 --> 00:06:09,721
What if we purged all
the weirdness from our systems?

164
00:06:09,722 --> 00:06:11,834
- You mean...
- A full 24-hour weird-down

165
00:06:11,835 --> 00:06:13,135
in the dreamatorium.

166
00:06:13,136 --> 00:06:14,920
Just you, me, and our
imaginations... no restraints.

167
00:06:14,921 --> 00:06:17,256
By the wedding, our temptation
to act weird will be gone.

168
00:06:17,257 --> 00:06:19,675
I'm feeling more normal already.

169
00:06:19,676 --> 00:06:21,376
- Crab walk home?
- Yeah.

170
00:06:24,648 --> 00:06:28,601
Shirley, my ninth-grade
English teacher used to say,

171
00:06:28,602 --> 00:06:31,020
"there will always be a reason
not to follow your dreams."

172
00:06:31,021 --> 00:06:33,572
At the time, he meant
I was under the age of consent.

173
00:06:33,573 --> 00:06:35,524
But his words still apply.

174
00:06:35,525 --> 00:06:38,327
Are you sure your wedding
is the reason you're bailing

175
00:06:38,328 --> 00:06:40,446
- on this business with Pierce?
- Uh, in the words

176
00:06:40,447 --> 00:06:42,230
of <i>my</i> ninth-grade
English teacher,

177
00:06:42,231 --> 00:06:44,283
"you are dippin' and dappin' and
don't know what's happenin'."

178
00:06:44,284 --> 00:06:45,701
Fine, we both went
to public school.

179
00:06:45,702 --> 00:06:47,836
It's just that
I don't want to see you slide

180
00:06:47,837 --> 00:06:50,372
- into your old comfort zone.
- You don't know that.

181
00:06:50,373 --> 00:06:53,342
I am gonna start a business...
Soon!

182
00:06:53,343 --> 00:06:55,711
I can't help it if I have
floral arrangements to pick

183
00:06:55,712 --> 00:06:56,912
and a DJ to hire...

184
00:06:56,913 --> 00:06:58,347
Shirley,
if that really is your excuse,

185
00:06:58,348 --> 00:07:01,283
I will plan
your wedding for you!

186
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,641
Ooh-hoo!
Thank you.

187
00:07:08,642 --> 00:07:10,225
Oh, my good God.
Thank you for that.

188
00:07:10,226 --> 00:07:13,579
I was serious.

189
00:07:16,316 --> 00:07:17,664
Britta, you're not
planning my wedding.

190
00:07:17,665 --> 00:07:19,535
- What if Annie helps?
- Oh, hey, guys.

191
00:07:19,536 --> 00:07:22,037
Did someone say "Annie",
"help," "wedding,"

192
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:23,872
and something
about maybe hydrangeas?

193
00:07:23,873 --> 00:07:25,124
Shirley,
you can lie to yourself,

194
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,542
but you can't lie to me.

195
00:07:26,543 --> 00:07:30,802
Do not use your second wedding
as an excuse to limit yourself.

196
00:07:30,803 --> 00:07:33,805
Pierce, come here.

197
00:07:33,806 --> 00:07:38,310
Shirley, do you take this man
to be your business partner?

198
00:07:38,311 --> 00:07:40,186
- Mmm, I guess.
- Sure.

199
00:07:40,187 --> 00:07:42,141
I had to shelve
the trouser bench anyway.

200
00:07:42,142 --> 00:07:43,976
There are still some parts
of the prototype

201
00:07:43,977 --> 00:07:47,696
that need to be extracted.

202
00:07:47,697 --> 00:07:50,316
Maybe you're misunderstanding?

203
00:07:50,317 --> 00:07:53,152
I mean, from my butt.

204
00:07:53,153 --> 00:07:54,636
Excuse me.

205
00:07:57,688 --> 00:07:59,495
Meet Shirley,

206
00:07:59,496 --> 00:08:02,395
she's modern, she's urban,
she's fun, and she's hungry.

207
00:08:02,396 --> 00:08:05,565
You probably notice she's black,
but not a stereotype...

208
00:08:05,566 --> 00:08:07,900
- Suburban black.
- Is she suburban or urban?

209
00:08:07,901 --> 00:08:09,318
She's half-urban.

210
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:12,104
Let's say...
Writer's secret, bad pitch...

211
00:08:12,105 --> 00:08:15,224
Her father's a record producer,
her mother's a Shirelle.

212
00:08:15,225 --> 00:08:17,360
We're supposed to be
preparing a business pitch.

213
00:08:17,361 --> 00:08:20,062
What about revenue projections?
What are the margins gonna be?

214
00:08:20,063 --> 00:08:22,048
Shirley, Shirley, Shirley,

215
00:08:22,049 --> 00:08:24,066
Shirley, Shirley,
Shirley, Shirley.

216
00:08:24,067 --> 00:08:27,336
Sweet, innocent Shirley.

217
00:08:27,337 --> 00:08:29,922
- What was the question?
- Look,

218
00:08:29,923 --> 00:08:32,174
this was Britta's stupid idea.

219
00:08:32,175 --> 00:08:33,859
I'd rather be with my man,
planning my wedding,

220
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,979
and you'd clearly rather be
with Halle Berry in 1999.

221
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:40,099
Pleasure not doing business
with you.

222
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:44,020
Shirley,
Hawthorne wipes fired me.

223
00:08:46,073 --> 00:08:49,975
They were just waiting for my
dad to be out of the picture.

224
00:08:49,976 --> 00:08:51,777
I'm not an entrepreneur.

225
00:08:51,778 --> 00:08:53,812
I'm just a kid
with a bunch of money, I...

226
00:08:55,949 --> 00:08:58,150
Please, please,
help me be somebody.

227
00:08:58,151 --> 00:09:01,153
Let me invest in you.

228
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,095
First thing we need
to figure out is our overhead.

229
00:09:09,096 --> 00:09:10,429
Do you have a pen?

230
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,465
Yeah.

231
00:09:12,466 --> 00:09:14,050
Oops.

232
00:09:14,051 --> 00:09:15,885
These pockets.

233
00:09:15,886 --> 00:09:17,503
Do you know someone
that can buy a pen?

234
00:09:17,504 --> 00:09:18,543
Yes!

235
00:09:18,544 --> 00:09:20,473
Well, have you thought
about the color story

236
00:09:20,474 --> 00:09:21,641
for your wedding?

237
00:09:21,642 --> 00:09:22,725
He means
the theme of the wedding.

238
00:09:22,726 --> 00:09:24,393
- Right, Dale?
- Mm-hmm.

239
00:09:24,394 --> 00:09:25,645
Same theme as every wedding...

240
00:09:25,646 --> 00:09:27,880
Conformity, blind participation,
and patriarchal...

241
00:09:27,881 --> 00:09:29,699
- What about pink?
- We don't call it pink.

242
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,233
We don't call anything
by its name.

243
00:09:31,234 --> 00:09:32,952
That's, like,
day-one floral school stuff.

244
00:09:32,953 --> 00:09:35,071
This is citrine.
This is opalescent.

245
00:09:35,072 --> 00:09:37,623
This is sea glass, cameo,
and cerulean.

246
00:09:37,624 --> 00:09:40,192
Come on, how difficult is this?

247
00:09:40,193 --> 00:09:42,461
You do one of these,
one of these,

248
00:09:42,462 --> 00:09:44,664
one of these, this one,

249
00:09:44,665 --> 00:09:47,866
this one and, like,
stick a ribbon on it. Happy?

250
00:09:50,637 --> 00:09:52,538
Britta, that's a really
beautiful arrangement.

251
00:09:52,539 --> 00:09:54,390
Color me lavender.

252
00:09:54,391 --> 00:09:56,008
"Lavender" means "impressed."

253
00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:59,395
Yeah, well, great...
Flowers look good in a pot.

254
00:09:59,396 --> 00:10:01,147
There are people dying
in Uganda.

255
00:10:02,733 --> 00:10:04,684
Got it.

256
00:10:04,685 --> 00:10:06,519
What!

257
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,853
Ugh!

258
00:10:07,854 --> 00:10:09,922
- Ahh, ahh, ahh.
- Don't eat my skin!

259
00:10:09,923 --> 00:10:12,692
I am shaving everything!

260
00:10:12,693 --> 00:10:15,411
- Well, that should do it.
- Yeah.

261
00:10:15,412 --> 00:10:17,229
My God, isn't tonight
Shirley's wedding rehearsal?

262
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,364
Look at how we're dressed.

263
00:10:18,365 --> 00:10:19,632
Yes, this simply won't do.

264
00:10:19,633 --> 00:10:20,833
Let's change
into something appropriate

265
00:10:20,834 --> 00:10:22,084
for the occasion
and be on our way.

266
00:10:22,085 --> 00:10:23,202
I agree.

267
00:10:23,203 --> 00:10:27,072
Troy and Abed being normal.

268
00:10:30,377 --> 00:10:31,844
Annie!

269
00:10:31,845 --> 00:10:34,363
I need your help.

270
00:10:34,364 --> 00:10:37,383
Um, you're, like,
sentimental and stuff.

271
00:10:37,384 --> 00:10:38,718
Oh!

272
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,236
I'm really having trouble
coming up with a toast.

273
00:10:40,237 --> 00:10:42,021
I find that hard
to believe, Jeff.

274
00:10:42,022 --> 00:10:43,239
You once convinced Troy

275
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,740
that turtlenecks
were made of turtles' necks.

276
00:10:44,741 --> 00:10:47,727
It's true, my superpower is
that I can assume any position

277
00:10:47,728 --> 00:10:49,812
that suits my purpose.
In that example...

278
00:10:49,813 --> 00:10:52,064
Keeping turtlenecks as an option
for myself, down the road.

279
00:10:52,065 --> 00:10:54,150
But I do have a kryptonite.

280
00:10:54,151 --> 00:10:56,452
It's so obvious to me
that marriage is dumb,

281
00:10:56,453 --> 00:10:57,987
I can't even pretend
to get behind it.

282
00:10:57,988 --> 00:10:59,705
You know what I think
would make the perfect toast?

283
00:10:59,706 --> 00:11:02,775
You, as Shirley's friend
and a good guy,

284
00:11:02,776 --> 00:11:04,577
just saying what's really
in your heart.

285
00:11:04,578 --> 00:11:07,713
There's something real
in there.

286
00:11:07,714 --> 00:11:11,450
Maybe that's what scares you.

287
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

288
00:11:21,843 --> 00:11:23,729
I could use a drink.

289
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,964
Shirley's sandwiches
can offer students

290
00:11:25,965 --> 00:11:27,800
more food for less money,
and provide the campus

291
00:11:27,801 --> 00:11:29,402
with a higher percentage
of the profits.

292
00:11:29,403 --> 00:11:30,436
Pierce, put up the next slide.

293
00:11:30,437 --> 00:11:32,371
That's me!

294
00:11:32,372 --> 00:11:35,107
Where'd I get all that money
I'm holding?

295
00:11:35,108 --> 00:11:36,525
I'm gonna tell you
the three reasons

296
00:11:36,526 --> 00:11:38,494
that Shirley's sandwiches
and your cafeteria are going

297
00:11:38,495 --> 00:11:39,695
to be successful.

298
00:11:39,696 --> 00:11:41,497
Well, then
I'm writing this down, hmm?

299
00:11:41,498 --> 00:11:43,482
Wait.

300
00:11:43,483 --> 00:11:45,251
Here's a pen.

301
00:11:45,252 --> 00:11:47,503
Thank you.

302
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:55,377
♪ Ooh ooh ooh ooh

303
00:11:55,378 --> 00:11:57,263
- ♪ ooh ooh ooh ooh...
- Holy crap!

304
00:11:57,264 --> 00:11:58,597
Britta, you're really good
at this.

305
00:11:58,598 --> 00:12:01,133
- I know.
- What's wrong with you?

306
00:12:01,134 --> 00:12:03,419
This may shock you, Annie,
but I come from a long line

307
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,138
- of wives and mothers.
- Many do.

308
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:08,023
But I ran away from it
my whole life.

309
00:12:08,024 --> 00:12:10,443
I refused to give Santa
a Christmas list,

310
00:12:10,444 --> 00:12:12,678
because I didn't want to depend
on any man for anything.

311
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:13,946
And now, look at me!

312
00:12:13,947 --> 00:12:16,232
I'm Betty Crocker.
I'm Martha Stewart.

313
00:12:16,233 --> 00:12:18,267
I'm one of
the Steppenwolf wives.

314
00:12:18,268 --> 00:12:21,070
Ohh, God.

315
00:12:21,071 --> 00:12:22,955
I'm gonna make some man
very happy someday.

316
00:12:22,956 --> 00:12:25,291
Ooh. Easy.
Slow down.

317
00:12:25,292 --> 00:12:26,642
What's with you guys?

318
00:12:26,643 --> 00:12:27,810
We de-whimsified ourselves.

319
00:12:27,811 --> 00:12:29,161
Yep. We're normal now.

320
00:12:29,162 --> 00:12:31,497
Oh. Good?

321
00:12:31,498 --> 00:12:33,031
Hey, anybody seen Shirley?

322
00:12:33,032 --> 00:12:34,550
What? Shirley's late to
the rehearsal for her wedding?

323
00:12:34,551 --> 00:12:35,718
Oh, my.

324
00:12:35,719 --> 00:12:37,486
Hey, man. You don't have
to be sarcastic.

325
00:12:37,487 --> 00:12:38,721
I'm not being sarcastic.

326
00:12:38,722 --> 00:12:40,205
We're heavily invested
in your situation.

327
00:12:40,206 --> 00:12:41,640
Nothing's more important to us

328
00:12:41,641 --> 00:12:43,542
than your second wedding's
rehearsal going smoothly.

329
00:12:43,543 --> 00:12:47,546
Walk away, man.

330
00:12:50,901 --> 00:12:53,152
Hey!
Did you think of a toast?

331
00:12:53,153 --> 00:12:54,236
Well, yeah.

332
00:12:54,237 --> 00:12:55,938
Uh, I had a drink,

333
00:12:55,939 --> 00:12:58,073
and I looked in my heart,

334
00:12:58,074 --> 00:13:02,060
and here's what I got so far...

335
00:13:02,061 --> 00:13:03,863
"Webster's dictionary defines..."

336
00:13:03,864 --> 00:13:05,347
Gah! Stop!

337
00:13:05,348 --> 00:13:07,166
"Webster's dictionary defines"?

338
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:09,401
That's the Jim Belushi
of speech openings...

339
00:13:09,402 --> 00:13:11,203
It accomplishes nothing,
but everyone keeps using it

340
00:13:11,204 --> 00:13:13,372
- and nobody understands why.
- Yeah, well, it's all I got.

341
00:13:13,373 --> 00:13:15,875
That took me eight hours
and six macallan neatses.

342
00:13:15,876 --> 00:13:18,210
Look, I'm sorry, I just
don't believe in marriage.

343
00:13:18,211 --> 00:13:19,712
I do.
It's inevitable.

344
00:13:21,574 --> 00:13:25,201
And then I'd put a counter
across here and the ovens there.

345
00:13:25,202 --> 00:13:26,719
Okay, okay.

346
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,255
And how fiscal will
the quarterly earnings be?

347
00:13:30,256 --> 00:13:31,807
Well, initially, the fiscal...

348
00:13:31,808 --> 00:13:32,925
Wait, that question makes
no sense.

349
00:13:32,926 --> 00:13:34,226
Ah! I know.

350
00:13:34,227 --> 00:13:36,612
I just want to sound
as good at business as you are.

351
00:13:36,613 --> 00:13:38,614
I probably shouldn't say this,

352
00:13:38,615 --> 00:13:41,033
but I cannot believe you learned
all this at Greendale.

353
00:13:41,034 --> 00:13:44,069
- You're very professional.
- I am, aren't I?

354
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:47,323
I brought sodas,
so we can toast to our futures.

355
00:13:47,324 --> 00:13:49,608
Look at me now, dad.

356
00:13:49,609 --> 00:13:50,943
Dad?
Oh, my God,

357
00:13:50,944 --> 00:13:52,294
I'm supposed to be
looking like a bride

358
00:13:52,295 --> 00:13:55,381
for my wedding rehearsal
to the dad of my children.

359
00:13:55,382 --> 00:13:57,333
That was...

360
00:13:57,334 --> 00:13:59,552
And odd dot to connect.

361
00:14:04,307 --> 00:14:07,176
Give me another.

362
00:14:07,177 --> 00:14:08,227
Mmm.

363
00:14:12,048 --> 00:14:14,683
What's with you?

364
00:14:14,684 --> 00:14:16,485
This is who I am.

365
00:14:16,486 --> 00:14:17,853
Andre, sorry I'm late.

366
00:14:17,854 --> 00:14:19,154
I have wonderful news.

367
00:14:19,155 --> 00:14:21,824
- Where were you?
- Uh, getting wonderful news.

368
00:14:21,825 --> 00:14:23,308
The Dean loved our pitch and...

369
00:14:23,309 --> 00:14:24,577
Your pitch?

370
00:14:24,578 --> 00:14:26,161
Woman, I've been waiting for you
for two hours.

371
00:14:26,162 --> 00:14:27,346
Oh, no.
Has it been that long?

372
00:14:27,347 --> 00:14:28,614
I'm so sorry.

373
00:14:28,615 --> 00:14:30,449
Don't you dare
use your sexy voice on me.

374
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:32,785
Ohh.

375
00:14:32,786 --> 00:14:34,086
It's just a rehearsal.

376
00:14:34,087 --> 00:14:35,621
Lord knows
we've done it before.

377
00:14:35,622 --> 00:14:37,806
That's not the point.

378
00:14:37,807 --> 00:14:39,341
Shirley, I thought
this wedding was supposed

379
00:14:39,342 --> 00:14:41,176
to be the start of us
getting back to normal.

380
00:14:41,177 --> 00:14:42,661
- Back to normal?
- Yes.

381
00:14:42,662 --> 00:14:44,763
I need to not be
Mr. Mom anymore.

382
00:14:44,764 --> 00:14:46,932
Okay, I got to get back
to my stereo business.

383
00:14:46,933 --> 00:14:48,684
You know my store's
been struggling.

384
00:14:48,685 --> 00:14:50,135
I'm sorry, Andre,

385
00:14:50,136 --> 00:14:52,438
but "normal" went out the door
the day you did.

386
00:14:52,439 --> 00:14:54,473
Well, if we can't get back
to the way things were,

387
00:14:54,474 --> 00:14:56,442
why the hell are we
getting remarried?

388
00:15:02,782 --> 00:15:04,750
Oy...

389
00:15:04,751 --> 00:15:06,602
These shrimp are to die for.

390
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:11,078
Yah, yah, yah!

391
00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:13,163
Yah, yah, yah!

392
00:15:14,523 --> 00:15:15,723
Walk the plank.

393
00:15:15,724 --> 00:15:17,859
I think you've mistaken us
for pirates.

394
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,844
<i>We</i> are
community college students.

395
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,748
Abed, I just had
an odd thought.

396
00:15:23,749 --> 00:15:25,283
What if once you go
from being weird to normal,

397
00:15:25,284 --> 00:15:27,018
you can never go back
to being weird again?

398
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:28,403
That is an odd thought.

399
00:15:28,404 --> 00:15:29,687
Well, let's hope it's the last.

400
00:15:29,688 --> 00:15:33,291
Cheers to that,
my everyday friend.

401
00:15:33,292 --> 00:15:34,542
Hello, everyone.

402
00:15:34,543 --> 00:15:38,546
Shirley asked me to say
something nice at her wedding.

403
00:15:38,547 --> 00:15:40,915
- This is the rehearsal.
- Shut up, Leonard!

404
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:43,201
Those teenage girls you play
ping-pong with are doing it ironically.

405
00:15:43,202 --> 00:15:44,836
Well!

406
00:15:44,837 --> 00:15:46,387
I searched my heart...

407
00:15:46,388 --> 00:15:50,008
For something nice to say
at a wedding.

408
00:15:50,009 --> 00:15:52,677
And I found nothing,
so I had a drink.

409
00:15:52,678 --> 00:15:55,730
And then I looked real hard.

410
00:15:55,731 --> 00:15:59,400
And you know what I found?

411
00:15:59,401 --> 00:16:03,404
My daddy said he would stay
with my mommy forever,

412
00:16:03,405 --> 00:16:05,123
and he left!

413
00:16:05,124 --> 00:16:08,193
Marriage is a lie!
Nobody commits to this!

414
00:16:08,194 --> 00:16:09,661
Nobody stays with anybody
forever,

415
00:16:09,662 --> 00:16:11,696
so why do we keep lying?

416
00:16:11,697 --> 00:16:12,897
I'm gonna stay
with somebody forever.

417
00:16:12,898 --> 00:16:15,450
It's in my stupid DNA.

418
00:16:15,451 --> 00:16:19,170
I was born to be a wife and
that's all I'm ever gonna be!

419
00:16:19,171 --> 00:16:20,571
You expect anyone here
to believe that?

420
00:16:20,572 --> 00:16:23,174
I don't care if anybody
believes it, jackass!

421
00:16:23,175 --> 00:16:25,076
- It's a fact!
- Prove it, ding dong!

422
00:16:25,077 --> 00:16:26,461
There are a lot of layers
to this.

423
00:16:26,462 --> 00:16:28,897
It's almost too conceptual
to follow, but...

424
00:16:28,898 --> 00:16:30,465
I love it.

425
00:16:30,466 --> 00:16:32,500
So that's what this
was all about, Andre?

426
00:16:32,501 --> 00:16:34,018
Just about wanting me back
in the kitchen?

427
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:35,887
I thought you loved
being a wife and a mother.

428
00:16:35,888 --> 00:16:37,088
Of course, but can't you see

429
00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:38,139
that's not all
I'm about anymore.

430
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,958
Hi, sorry,
don't want to interrupt.

431
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:42,694
But you are cordially invited
to prevent a disaster.

432
00:16:42,695 --> 00:16:45,280
I promise to put your dreams
before mine.

433
00:16:45,281 --> 00:16:46,881
I promise to bottle up
my repulsion

434
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:48,432
at the sight of your hair
in the drain.

435
00:16:48,433 --> 00:16:51,653
I promise to earn no more than
70% of what you would make

436
00:16:51,654 --> 00:16:52,937
at the same job.

437
00:16:52,938 --> 00:16:54,489
- What about babies?
- What about 'em?

438
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:55,740
- How many?
- Pick a number, dick!

439
00:16:55,741 --> 00:16:56,874
Like, it's up to me!

440
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,660
What in God's name
are you two doing?

441
00:16:58,661 --> 00:17:00,128
Getting married.

442
00:17:00,129 --> 00:17:01,779
What does it look like
we're doing?

443
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:04,115
You two are damn fools.
Oh, sorry.

444
00:17:04,116 --> 00:17:06,117
- I'll allow it.
- I am a fool.

445
00:17:06,118 --> 00:17:10,171
I was a fool to think I wasn't
destined for a life of this.

446
00:17:10,172 --> 00:17:11,455
I mean, look around.

447
00:17:11,456 --> 00:17:14,392
Can you even imagine what kind
of wedding I could throw

448
00:17:14,393 --> 00:17:16,294
if I actually gave a crap?

449
00:17:16,295 --> 00:17:19,297
- No offense.
- Knock it off.

450
00:17:19,298 --> 00:17:21,516
Being good at weddings doesn't
make you good at marriage.

451
00:17:21,517 --> 00:17:22,650
Exactly.

452
00:17:22,651 --> 00:17:23,901
People can make all sorts
of promises,

453
00:17:23,902 --> 00:17:25,520
but they never stick it out.

454
00:17:25,521 --> 00:17:27,689
It's not something you
just stick out, man, all right?

455
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:28,906
It's a risk
that you take together.

456
00:17:28,907 --> 00:17:30,808
And you don't
just promise it once.

457
00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:32,610
You got to promise it
every day.

458
00:17:32,611 --> 00:17:34,195
Yes, but the person you're
making promises to

459
00:17:34,196 --> 00:17:36,614
is going to change.
You have to accept that.

460
00:17:36,615 --> 00:17:39,617
I do.
But do you promise to be patient

461
00:17:39,618 --> 00:17:42,153
when that person's stereo
business takes a little while

462
00:17:42,154 --> 00:17:44,155
- to get off the ground.
- I do, but...

463
00:17:44,156 --> 00:17:46,107
Do you accept that ten years
is more than a little while

464
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:47,592
and that iPods
aren't going away,

465
00:17:47,593 --> 00:17:51,629
and maybe it's time to let
somebody else take the lead?

466
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:52,764
I do.

467
00:17:52,765 --> 00:17:55,049
You do?

468
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:58,386
Yes, baby, I swear I do.

469
00:17:58,387 --> 00:18:00,355
Then I promise I will do
whatever it takes

470
00:18:00,356 --> 00:18:02,106
to make this work forever.

471
00:18:02,107 --> 00:18:04,142
Oh!

472
00:18:04,143 --> 00:18:06,510
Well, in that case,
let's rehearse this bad boy.

473
00:18:06,511 --> 00:18:07,812
- Mm-hmm.
- Actually,

474
00:18:07,813 --> 00:18:09,230
you pretty much just married
each other.

475
00:18:09,231 --> 00:18:11,032
If you let me pronounce you
man and wife,

476
00:18:11,033 --> 00:18:12,483
you can kiss the bride

477
00:18:12,484 --> 00:18:14,786
and you can save like, um,
70 bucks.

478
00:18:14,787 --> 00:18:16,354
- What do you say, baby?
- Mmm.

479
00:18:16,355 --> 00:18:18,139
Mm-hmm.

480
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,325
Done and done.
Husband and wife.

481
00:18:20,326 --> 00:18:22,410
Now how about it?

482
00:18:22,411 --> 00:18:26,497
Let's party!

483
00:18:26,498 --> 00:18:28,750
Lame.

484
00:18:46,385 --> 00:18:47,385
Abed.

485
00:18:47,386 --> 00:18:48,519
Abed! Abed!

486
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,355
We're weird.
We need to be weird.

487
00:18:50,356 --> 00:18:51,906
You want to see something
weird? Check out this dance.

488
00:18:51,907 --> 00:18:53,574
Uh, what did you call this?
The "Lindbergh lean"?

489
00:18:53,575 --> 00:18:55,059
What'll they think of next?

490
00:18:59,114 --> 00:19:01,449
Inspector spacetime...

491
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,751
Ohh, thank the cosmic engineer
I found you.

492
00:19:03,752 --> 00:19:05,203
Troy, this is hardly the time.

493
00:19:05,204 --> 00:19:07,571
Or is it hardly the space?

494
00:19:07,572 --> 00:19:08,873
Okay, I see what you did there.

495
00:19:08,874 --> 00:19:10,258
But now I have to get back
to my Lindbergh lean

496
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:11,876
with, uh... I'm sorry,
I didn't catch your name.

497
00:19:11,877 --> 00:19:14,212
Inspector...
What sort of creature

498
00:19:14,213 --> 00:19:18,082
would do a dance
called the Lindbergh lean?

499
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:20,184
- Blorgons?
- Blorgons.

500
00:19:20,185 --> 00:19:22,186
My name's Danielle.

501
00:19:22,187 --> 00:19:25,423
Constable Reggie, it appears
the Blorgons have developed

502
00:19:25,424 --> 00:19:28,860
- the ability to take human form.
- Weirdos.

503
00:19:30,546 --> 00:19:34,399
Your photonic bowler hat.

504
00:19:35,951 --> 00:19:37,785
Ahh.

505
00:19:37,786 --> 00:19:39,103
Blorgon patrol.

506
00:19:39,104 --> 00:19:42,123
Shirley, I have some
good news and bad news.

507
00:19:42,124 --> 00:19:45,543
The good news is the board loved
your sandwich shop idea.

508
00:19:46,778 --> 00:19:49,046
The bad news
is that they made a few calls

509
00:19:49,047 --> 00:19:50,715
and sold the space to subway,
the sandwich place.

510
00:19:50,716 --> 00:19:53,076
What? Pierce and I put
a lot of work into that idea.

511
00:19:53,077 --> 00:19:55,720
- How could you do this, Dean?
- I'm sorry!

512
00:19:55,721 --> 00:19:57,255
The board went over my head
on this one.

513
00:19:57,256 --> 00:19:59,974
And I don't remember being
invited to your wedding,

514
00:19:59,975 --> 00:20:03,060
so I guess we're even
on the hurting-each-other front.

515
00:20:03,061 --> 00:20:07,231
I'm a blast at weddings.

516
00:20:07,232 --> 00:20:09,016
There go all my dreams.

517
00:20:09,017 --> 00:20:10,802
This is just a setback.

518
00:20:10,803 --> 00:20:13,087
You don't have to give up
just because of subway.

519
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:15,056
Guess I better go break
the news to Pierce.

520
00:20:15,057 --> 00:20:16,474
He's not gonna like this.

521
00:20:16,475 --> 00:20:17,992
Remember that
temper tantrum he threw

522
00:20:17,993 --> 00:20:20,361
when Adam Sandier "stole"
his idea for <i>Jack and Jill?</i>

523
00:20:20,362 --> 00:20:21,612
You're underestimating him.

524
00:20:21,613 --> 00:20:22,864
I think Pierce
is a lot more mature

525
00:20:22,865 --> 00:20:24,115
than we all give him
credit for.

526
00:20:24,116 --> 00:20:28,786
Look at me now, dad!
How's it taste?

527
00:20:28,787 --> 00:20:32,673
How many sandwich places
did you have?

528
00:20:32,674 --> 00:20:34,827
None!

529
00:20:34,828 --> 00:20:38,453
