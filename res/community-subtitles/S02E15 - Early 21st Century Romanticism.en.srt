1
00:00:08,522 --> 00:00:10,831
Why does being a librarian
make her even hotter?

2
00:00:10,832 --> 00:00:11,968
They're keepers of knowledge.

3
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:13,643
She holds the answers
to all of our questions,

4
00:00:13,644 --> 00:00:14,276
like, "will you marry me,"

5
00:00:14,277 --> 00:00:16,282
and "why are there still libraries."

6
00:00:16,283 --> 00:00:18,714
I wanna be a book. She can pick me up.

7
00:00:18,715 --> 00:00:19,852
Flip through my pages.

8
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,969
Make sure nobody drew wieners in me.

9
00:00:23,086 --> 00:00:24,863
Hey, maybe if we're too loud,
she'll shush us.

10
00:00:24,864 --> 00:00:25,675
Okay.

11
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,085
Books!

12
00:00:27,591 --> 00:00:28,938
Pretend like you're asleep.

13
00:00:32,865 --> 00:00:33,699
Jeff.

14
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,112
What do you do when
you and your best friend

15
00:00:35,113 --> 00:00:36,834
wanna ask the same girl
to the Valentine's dance,

16
00:00:36,835 --> 00:00:37,987
but neither of you have dibs

17
00:00:37,988 --> 00:00:39,686
because you both fell in love
with her at first sight?

18
00:00:39,687 --> 00:00:42,074
Well, I don't believe in dibs
or love at first sight

19
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:44,916
or love or best friends or doing things.

20
00:00:44,917 --> 00:00:46,052
But it's good you brought this to me.

21
00:00:46,053 --> 00:00:47,371
You're gonna have to open
your heart one day, Jeff.

22
00:00:47,372 --> 00:00:48,180
What happens if I don't?

23
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:49,799
I miss the heart opening deadline?

24
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,772
Valentine's Crapentine's.

25
00:00:52,745 --> 00:00:54,396
Opening my heart is on my list.

26
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:56,750
Pierce?

27
00:00:56,751 --> 00:00:58,306
- Mm-hmm.
- What was that?

28
00:00:58,447 --> 00:01:00,292
- Gum.
- Why aren't you chewing?

29
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:03,506
Because I'm using my mouth
for this dumb conversation.

30
00:01:07,674 --> 00:01:08,642
Bye.

31
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:12,410
That's my friend page.
She's cool, but...Whatever.

32
00:01:12,535 --> 00:01:14,719
- She's cute.
- Oh, Troy.

33
00:01:14,878 --> 00:01:16,359
Before you go barking up that tree,

34
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,764
I have to tell you that
she might not be interested.

35
00:01:18,765 --> 00:01:20,314
Why wouldn't she be...

36
00:01:20,635 --> 00:01:22,837
Oh! Is she...

37
00:01:23,722 --> 00:01:24,856
A friend of Ellen?

38
00:01:24,857 --> 00:01:27,095
Yes, Annie. But you can say the word.

39
00:01:27,096 --> 00:01:29,899
Page is a...Lesbian.

40
00:01:35,169 --> 00:01:37,569
Pierce, as someone who's been
calling me a lesbian

41
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:38,819
for the last year and a half,

42
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,790
I'm sure that you don't have
anything to say

43
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:42,693
about me being friends with one.

44
00:01:43,034 --> 00:01:44,396
Nothing off the cuff.

45
00:01:44,721 --> 00:01:47,245
What I do have is a prepared statement.

♪ Give me some rope, time in a tree

48
00:02:02,031 --> 00:02:05,237
give me the hope to run out of steam

49
00:02:05,238 --> 00:02:08,461
somebody said we could be here

50
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:12,662
we could be roped up,
tied up, dead in a year

51
00:02:12,663 --> 00:02:17,106
I can't count the reasons I should stay

52
00:02:17,647 --> 00:02:21,939
one by one they all just fade away

53
00:02:24,847 --> 00:02:27,057
"And in summation,

54
00:02:27,058 --> 00:02:28,142
"good luck...

And bon appetit."

56

Many, many paragraphs of that

57
00:02:36,411 --> 00:02:37,979
were oddly supportive.

58
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,488
Wait till you hear the one
I have for you.

59
00:02:43,362 --> 00:02:45,329
Okay. I know that wasn't gum.

60
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,395
You're right.
It was an awesome exit pill.

61
00:02:48,396 --> 00:02:50,626
Zip! Zop! Zooey!

62
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:52,842
Bye!

64
00:03:02,373 --> 00:03:04,198
We gotta do something about Pierce
and those pain killers.

65
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:06,000
He's recovering

66
00:03:06,001 --> 00:03:08,221
dude can moonwalk!

67
00:03:08,222 --> 00:03:10,168
Now, I'm sure he's almost
through his prescription.

68
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:11,540
Besides, he's a baby boom.

69
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:12,577
They invented drugs.

70
00:03:12,578 --> 00:03:14,434
Yeah, they also invented TV.

71
00:03:14,435 --> 00:03:16,170
Have you seen him control one of those?

72
00:03:16,171 --> 00:03:18,135
Intervention. Intervention, intervention.

73
00:03:18,136 --> 00:03:19,793
- Count me out.
- We can't count you out.

74
00:03:19,794 --> 00:03:20,468
He listens to you.

75
00:03:20,469 --> 00:03:22,385
Well, he also listens
to the Barenaked Ladies.

76
00:03:22,386 --> 00:03:24,398
Go get their dumb asses to help you.

77
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,189
- Back it up!
- Okay, Jeff.

78
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,514
You are clearly in a bad space today.

79
00:03:28,515 --> 00:03:30,454
But Pierce is our friend,

80
00:03:30,455 --> 00:03:33,464
and the Barenaked Ladies
are triple platinum... Are you?

81
00:03:33,465 --> 00:03:35,888
Why does everyone leap
to defend that band

82
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:37,327
so aggressively?

83
00:03:37,328 --> 00:03:39,303
And how much stuff do we have
to go through this year

84
00:03:39,304 --> 00:03:40,867
before my friendship
stops being questioned?

85
00:03:40,868 --> 00:03:42,037
Well, maybe friendship

86
00:03:42,038 --> 00:03:44,314
is about going through
a lot of stuff, Jeff.

87
00:03:44,315 --> 00:03:47,267
And maybe BNL has
two Billboard awards to your zero.

88
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,675
Oh, okay. They're... they're BNL now.

89
00:03:49,676 --> 00:03:52,036
We use shorthand for the Barenaked Ladies.

90
00:03:52,037 --> 00:03:53,585
That's how fundamental they are.

91
00:03:53,586 --> 00:03:54,617
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

92
00:03:54,618 --> 00:03:57,243
You know what Pierce probably
needs more than anything?

93
00:03:57,244 --> 00:03:59,933
Some space. Maybe I do too.

94
00:03:59,934 --> 00:04:02,168
You know what?
Maybe we all need some space

95
00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:03,457
to pull the knife out of the back

96
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:05,537
of the most celebrated Canadian
alt rock band

97
00:04:05,538 --> 00:04:08,122
of the mid-nineties,
you selfish, jaded ass!

98
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:10,513
This...is a fight!

99
00:04:10,514 --> 00:04:12,461
We...are fighting!

100
00:04:14,634 --> 00:04:16,062
Jeff. Hello!

101
00:04:16,094 --> 00:04:17,739
I hear you're fighting
with your study group.

102
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,427
- Correct.
- Now, you won't know this,

103
00:04:19,428 --> 00:04:22,330
being American, but tonight
Liverpool are playing...

104
00:04:22,331 --> 00:04:23,674
Manchester United.

105
00:04:23,675 --> 00:04:26,034
I am a stylish American, professor.

106
00:04:26,035 --> 00:04:28,264
I've been forcing myself
to be into soccer since 2004.

107
00:04:28,265 --> 00:04:29,889
Ah! Then it's destiny.

108
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:33,199
God gave you a British friend
and a massive TV for a reason.

109
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,998
Oh, it's Valentine's Day,
and even though we're fighting,

110
00:04:35,999 --> 00:04:38,158
I did promise the study group
I'd go to the dance...

111
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:40,009
You promised the study group?
Whip, crack!

112
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,774
I'll see you at precisely 6:30,

113
00:04:41,775 --> 00:04:44,497
or as the English call it,
gravedigger's biscuits.

114
00:04:44,498 --> 00:04:45,389
Okay?

115
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:56,622
That moonwalk back there
was streets ahead, buddy.

116
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:57,968
Hey, thanks, buddy.

117
00:04:58,263 --> 00:05:00,738
- Hey, Pierce!
- Hey, it's you!

118
00:05:00,894 --> 00:05:04,368
Yeah. The tiny man you see
when you take enough pills.

119
00:05:04,463 --> 00:05:06,505
We have a good time, don't we, Pierce?

120
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:08,736
- I ain't hurtin'.
- And you wanna keep this going,

121
00:05:08,737 --> 00:05:10,829
right, 'cause... I'm sure you've noticed

122
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,780
the prescription is almost done.

123
00:05:12,781 --> 00:05:15,057
Ah. Ha. I don't think the doctor...

124
00:05:15,058 --> 00:05:16,789
Doctor, you know, I know he won't...

125
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,981
Pierce, if doctors are so smart,

126
00:05:18,982 --> 00:05:20,829
why are there millions of 'em?

127
00:05:22,218 --> 00:05:23,461
Look in your hand.

128
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,654
It's Valentine's, buddy.

129
00:05:29,657 --> 00:05:30,676
Be mine.

130
00:05:35,241 --> 00:05:36,573
Mariah, my name is Abed Nadir.

131
00:05:36,574 --> 00:05:39,075
- My associate Troy Barnes.
- Charmed, I'm sure.

132
00:05:39,167 --> 00:05:40,486
Are you the guys that keep staring at me

133
00:05:40,487 --> 00:05:42,008
and intermittently yelling out, "books"?

134
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,853
The very same.
We are both interested

135
00:05:43,854 --> 00:05:45,254
in taking you to the Valentine's dance,

136
00:05:45,255 --> 00:05:46,981
but we are also best friends
with each other.

137
00:05:46,982 --> 00:05:49,085
It is of utmost importance
we protect that friendship

138
00:05:49,086 --> 00:05:50,396
from the stresses of courting you,

139
00:05:50,397 --> 00:05:51,538
so we're trying to be as direct

140
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:52,873
and aboveboard about this as possible.

141
00:05:52,874 --> 00:05:54,276
Will you go to the dance with one of us,

142
00:05:54,277 --> 00:05:56,085
and if so, which one?

143
00:05:56,978 --> 00:05:58,788
We need to get something straight first.

144
00:05:59,145 --> 00:06:01,362
This is the cutest thing
that's ever happened to me.

145
00:06:01,906 --> 00:06:04,825
But...I don't know either one of you.

146
00:06:04,826 --> 00:06:05,933
Give us a moment.

147
00:06:08,026 --> 00:06:09,734
Dude, I need to eat those tacos.

148
00:06:10,576 --> 00:06:12,078
New proposal: Get to know us at the dance

149
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:14,293
and decide there which
of us you'd like to see again.

150
00:06:15,205 --> 00:06:16,418
Okay. Deal.

151
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:17,378
Nice.

152
00:06:18,322 --> 00:06:19,542
What's in the briefcase?

153
00:06:19,937 --> 00:06:21,569
Oh. Tacos.

154
00:06:22,606 --> 00:06:23,665
You want one?

155
00:06:23,962 --> 00:06:24,414
No.

156
00:06:24,415 --> 00:06:26,480
Great. We really wanted them.

157
00:06:26,481 --> 00:06:27,863
Yeah. We're gonna eat them.

158
00:06:28,636 --> 00:06:31,712
So like...Would you change
clothes in front of her?

159
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:34,193
Annie, I know your lack
of world experience

160
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:36,473
creates curiosity, but questions like that

161
00:06:36,474 --> 00:06:38,448
can make you seem a little bit homophobic.

162
00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:40,032
It's homophobic to ask questions?

163
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:42,721
If you have to ask
if it's homophobic to ask questions,

164
00:06:42,722 --> 00:06:45,021
haven't you already answered
your own question?

165
00:06:45,785 --> 00:06:46,389
Have I?

166
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,728
Don't know. Not a homophobe.

167
00:06:50,518 --> 00:06:52,471
Oh. There's Page.

168
00:06:52,472 --> 00:06:55,837
Should I ask her 500 questions
about being a lesbian?

169
00:06:55,838 --> 00:06:58,052
Or should I just treat her
like a normal person?

170
00:06:58,053 --> 00:07:00,414
That's a question you can ask.

171
00:07:06,491 --> 00:07:08,096
- Hey.
- Hi.

172
00:07:09,955 --> 00:07:12,021
- I'm not a lesbian.
- Oh!

173
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,052
- I'm not either.
- Oh.

174
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,393
But it's cool that you're friends
with one.

175
00:07:16,514 --> 00:07:17,505
Oh.

176
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,168
Page isn't a lesbian.

177
00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:20,559
She just likes hanging out with Britta,

178
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,114
because it makes her feel cool
to have a lesbian friend.

179
00:07:23,367 --> 00:07:27,022
But...Britta's not a lesbian.
She thinks that Page is.

180
00:07:32,104 --> 00:07:33,492
Guess what, Annie.

181
00:07:33,512 --> 00:07:36,078
Page and I are going
to the dance together.

182
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:38,529
Hope I stay straight, right?

183
00:07:39,987 --> 00:07:41,887
Oh, sorry. My friend's a tad homophobic,

184
00:07:41,888 --> 00:07:43,429
so I was doing a bit.

185
00:07:51,321 --> 00:07:52,864
Pretty exciting first half.

186
00:07:52,865 --> 00:07:55,119
Yeah, 0-0. Electrifying.

187
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,662
Aw. Worried that your six-headed
ball and chain

188
00:07:57,663 --> 00:07:59,070
will be calling?

189
00:07:59,071 --> 00:08:00,083
Fine.

190
00:08:03,167 --> 00:08:05,786
That's better, you big slut.

191
00:08:13,086 --> 00:08:14,216
It's Chang!

192
00:08:14,217 --> 00:08:15,432
Chang? Why?

193
00:08:15,433 --> 00:08:16,230
I don't know!

194
00:08:16,231 --> 00:08:18,085
I can hear you guys.

195
00:08:18,288 --> 00:08:19,334
What are you doing here, Chang,

196
00:08:19,335 --> 00:08:20,714
and how do you know where I live?

197
00:08:20,715 --> 00:08:22,234
I can answer both of those questions

198
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:24,464
by returning your driver's license.

199
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:29,656
Ha!

200
00:08:29,657 --> 00:08:30,704
There it is!

201
00:08:30,705 --> 00:08:32,543
Man U. versus Liverpool!

202
00:08:32,544 --> 00:08:33,851
For God's sake, just let him in.

203
00:08:33,852 --> 00:08:36,500
He's wearing the right colors
and everything.

204
00:08:36,867 --> 00:08:38,804
- Come in.
- Don't mind if I Chang!

205
00:08:38,915 --> 00:08:41,408
Heh heh. Hey, man, check this out.

206
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:42,475
Ya-haa!

207
00:08:43,937 --> 00:08:46,027
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

208
00:08:53,843 --> 00:08:55,581
Anyway, the thing I was going
to show you guys

209
00:08:55,582 --> 00:08:56,409
is pretty cool.

210
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,306
I'm ignoring you and watching soccer.

211
00:08:58,307 --> 00:08:59,824
Just sit down, Chang.

212
00:08:59,825 --> 00:09:02,229
There's space for three fannies
on this sofa.

213
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:04,698
Hey. In England,
fanny means vagina, right?

214
00:09:04,699 --> 00:09:07,119
In England, everything means vagina.

215
00:09:09,042 --> 00:09:10,342
I'm gonna make it up to you, Winger.

216
00:09:10,343 --> 00:09:13,572
Even though, like I said,
weird place to put a lamp.

217
00:09:13,775 --> 00:09:16,950
- But let me order a pizza.
- Ooh, I love pizza!

218
00:09:16,951 --> 00:09:19,376
In england we call them Italian fannies.

219
00:09:19,377 --> 00:09:20,581
I'm hookin' us up!

220
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,855
- Cellie...
- Ah. Go use the landline.

221
00:09:22,856 --> 00:09:25,885
Landline? Okay, grandma Bell.

222
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,822
Star-burns, it's Chang.

223
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,639
Remember that pizza you owe me?

224
00:09:33,194 --> 00:09:34,828
Well, it's time to pay up.

225
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:37,837
Party at Winger's. Tonight.

226
00:09:39,103 --> 00:09:40,500
Yeah, you can tell people.

227
00:09:40,732 --> 00:09:41,995
Cool. Cool.

228
00:09:43,138 --> 00:09:44,770
Hey, uh, wingding at Winger's.

229
00:09:46,072 --> 00:09:47,350
So Mariah, what you get with me

230
00:09:47,351 --> 00:09:48,736
is the complete package...

231
00:09:48,737 --> 00:09:51,152
HBO, Showtime, Starz, Starz black.

232
00:09:51,153 --> 00:09:52,313
Sounds expensive.

233
00:09:52,314 --> 00:09:53,711
With all due respect to my friend here,

234
00:09:53,712 --> 00:09:54,644
if you go with me,

235
00:09:54,645 --> 00:09:56,299
you can expect this on the dance floor.

236
00:10:01,302 --> 00:10:03,233
Go, go, go, go, go.

237
00:10:03,234 --> 00:10:05,519
Go, go, go, go, go!

238
00:10:09,099 --> 00:10:10,880
I feel like everyone's staring.

239
00:10:10,935 --> 00:10:11,704
Not that I care.

240
00:10:11,705 --> 00:10:13,761
Well, of course they're staring.

241
00:10:13,762 --> 00:10:14,720
They've probably never seen

242
00:10:14,721 --> 00:10:17,896
a straight girl and a lesbian
so comfortable together.

243
00:10:17,897 --> 00:10:19,177
Exactly.

244
00:10:20,657 --> 00:10:22,142
Those two were talking about us.

245
00:10:22,641 --> 00:10:25,046
Well, let's give them something
to really talk about.

246
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:27,958
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

247
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:32,566
- 'Scuse us.
- Hi.

248
00:10:32,567 --> 00:10:33,603
Hi. Sorry.

249
00:10:43,425 --> 00:10:44,924
Cool music, huh?

250
00:10:49,609 --> 00:10:51,266
Oh, nice call, ref!

251
00:10:51,267 --> 00:10:52,578
Bite my banger!

252
00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:55,607
Jeff, something's up
with your toothbrush, man.

253
00:10:55,608 --> 00:10:57,744
- What the hell?
- I had to get cleaned up.

254
00:10:57,745 --> 00:10:58,780
Why?

255
00:11:00,662 --> 00:11:02,239
Oh, yeah!

256
00:11:03,308 --> 00:11:04,548
Pizza time!

257
00:11:04,549 --> 00:11:06,776
- Leonard?
- Where are the white women at?

258
00:11:06,777 --> 00:11:08,511
No. There are no white
women here, Leonard.

259
00:11:08,512 --> 00:11:09,961
This is not a party!

260
00:11:09,962 --> 00:11:11,905
Don't tell that to Magnitude.

261
00:11:11,906 --> 00:11:13,133
Who's Magnitude?

262
00:11:13,134 --> 00:11:14,946
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!

263
00:11:14,947 --> 00:11:15,990
Pop, pop!

264
00:11:15,991 --> 00:11:17,274
Pop, pop!

265
00:11:17,797 --> 00:11:18,882
Bam!

266
00:11:19,102 --> 00:11:20,142
Bam!

267
00:11:20,143 --> 00:11:22,051
Come on in. What's up, what's up?

268
00:11:22,052 --> 00:11:24,572
What's up? Looking good, looking good.

269
00:11:24,887 --> 00:11:27,619
That's my analysis of
the Saw movie franchise.

270
00:11:28,295 --> 00:11:29,186
That about does it,

271
00:11:29,187 --> 00:11:31,030
so I think it's time for you to choose.

272
00:11:35,008 --> 00:11:36,823
Abed, could you get us some punch?

273
00:11:36,824 --> 00:11:37,796
On it.

274
00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:41,708
You guys are really cute together.

275
00:11:42,616 --> 00:11:43,120
Thank you.

276
00:11:43,121 --> 00:11:45,578
But you know, having to...

277
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,066
Actually choose, I...

278
00:11:47,067 --> 00:11:49,180
Hey. We both agreed to this.

279
00:11:49,181 --> 00:11:50,775
We're both very comfortable
with each other,

280
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:52,713
- so I won't be...
- No. I choose you, Troy.

281
00:11:54,927 --> 00:11:55,829
Punch.

282
00:11:56,905 --> 00:11:58,544
- Hey, Abed.
- Hey.

283
00:11:58,689 --> 00:11:59,716
I, um...

284
00:11:59,793 --> 00:12:02,436
She...Just... She chose me.

285
00:12:04,001 --> 00:12:06,172
Cool. You can have this then.

286
00:12:06,376 --> 00:12:08,190
Thank you, Mariah. Have a great night.

287
00:12:16,286 --> 00:12:17,346
That's great!

288
00:12:17,669 --> 00:12:18,612
Pierce?

289
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:20,282
You go straight to hell!

290
00:12:20,676 --> 00:12:21,649
Wh...

291
00:12:22,684 --> 00:12:23,559
Ha...

292
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:24,635
Oh, I'm sorry, Annie.

293
00:12:24,636 --> 00:12:26,495
I...I've been... I don't know.

294
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,879
I've been going through
all these mood swings lately.

295
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,926
You understand we care about you, right?

296
00:12:31,787 --> 00:12:32,688
Okay?

297
00:12:33,346 --> 00:12:34,294
Okay.

298
00:12:36,481 --> 00:12:37,482
Well, look.

299
00:12:37,483 --> 00:12:38,706
Here's the deal.

300
00:12:38,707 --> 00:12:41,867
I am not sharing you with them.

301
00:12:41,868 --> 00:12:43,904
So before this goes further,

302
00:12:44,546 --> 00:12:46,799
you have a choice to make, my friend.

303
00:12:49,483 --> 00:12:52,120
Ha ha! Look at the lesbians.

304
00:12:55,499 --> 00:12:56,434
Lesbians!

305
00:12:56,435 --> 00:12:57,718
- Screw you!
- Screw you!

306
00:13:02,563 --> 00:13:03,220
No, no.

307
00:13:03,221 --> 00:13:05,497
- I don't care what they say.
- Oh, I don't either.

308
00:13:05,498 --> 00:13:07,539
I just wish it wasn't
such an issue for them.

309
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,255
Yeah, but that starts with us.

310
00:13:10,809 --> 00:13:12,981
It starts...With us.

311
00:13:27,082 --> 00:13:29,213
- I've never done this before.
- Me neither.

312
00:13:29,482 --> 00:13:30,769
Wait! What?

313
00:13:33,651 --> 00:13:34,653
So...

314
00:13:35,642 --> 00:13:37,550
Curious about one thing.

315
00:13:38,335 --> 00:13:39,874
What was wrong with Abed?

316
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:42,205
Well, I mean, he did talk
about the Saw movies

317
00:13:42,206 --> 00:13:43,269
for two hours.

318
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:45,309
Yeah, but there are eight of them,

319
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:46,858
and they're two hours apiece,

320
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:48,865
and the first one did redefine
the genre, and...

321
00:13:48,866 --> 00:13:51,362
Troy, I would love to be his friend.

322
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:52,720
I know you would. It's incredible.

323
00:13:52,721 --> 00:13:54,822
But romantically, he's...

324
00:13:56,407 --> 00:13:58,003
You know.

325
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:02,450
I hate her, I hate her, I hate her,
I hate her!

326
00:14:04,075 --> 00:14:06,328
- What happened?
- She called you weird!

327
00:14:06,714 --> 00:14:08,480
- I am weird.
- Not as weird as her!

328
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:10,477
Who the hell is Nicholas Nickleby?

329
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:12,474
She wouldn't shut up about it.

330
00:14:12,475 --> 00:14:13,680
Mm. I know.

331
00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:17,647
There's someone out there for us.

332
00:14:19,665 --> 00:14:20,929
Happy Valentine's Day.

333
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:22,710
It is now.

334
00:14:31,395 --> 00:14:33,159
- Ignore her.
- Okay.

335
00:14:36,868 --> 00:14:38,472
It's weird, but I've never heard
of Magnitude

336
00:14:38,473 --> 00:14:39,680
before tonight.

337
00:14:39,681 --> 00:14:41,602
He's a one-man party!

338
00:14:41,863 --> 00:14:43,724
You're always busy with your study group.

339
00:14:43,725 --> 00:14:45,388
Well, he's not with them tonight.

340
00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:47,608
Oh, yeah!

341
00:14:47,836 --> 00:14:49,401
I thought you quit drinking, Duncan.

342
00:14:49,402 --> 00:14:50,879
False alarm on that one.

343
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,421
Oh, yeah!

344
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:53,882
Pop, pop!

345
00:14:53,883 --> 00:14:55,899
Ha ho! Pop, pop!

346
00:14:55,900 --> 00:15:00,750
- Pop pop pop pop pop pop!
- Pop pop pop pop pop pop!

347
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,941
I never said I was a lesbian.

348
00:15:04,942 --> 00:15:06,673
Why didn't you just ask me?

349
00:15:06,674 --> 00:15:08,610
Oh, what am I, a homophobe?

350
00:15:08,611 --> 00:15:10,360
I don't care about people's preferences.

351
00:15:10,361 --> 00:15:11,549
You so care.

352
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,429
You are clearly just hanging out with me

353
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:14,881
because you thought I was gay.

354
00:15:14,882 --> 00:15:17,149
So? What were you doing with me?

355
00:15:17,945 --> 00:15:19,354
Hey, what does it matter, you know?

356
00:15:19,355 --> 00:15:20,507
We're both just humans

357
00:15:20,508 --> 00:15:22,839
trying to make our way through
this crazy world.

358
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:24,394
You're the worst!

359
00:15:24,395 --> 00:15:26,201
- What?
- And for the record,

360
00:15:26,202 --> 00:15:27,682
I never thought you were cool.

361
00:15:27,683 --> 00:15:29,757
I only thought you were a lesbian.

362
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:39,560
Page is straight.

363
00:15:40,924 --> 00:15:41,895
Really?

364
00:15:43,256 --> 00:15:44,239
Well...

365
00:15:44,627 --> 00:15:45,814
When she was gay

366
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:48,784
I thought it was really cool of you
to make out with her.

367
00:15:49,659 --> 00:15:51,038
Thanks, Annie.

368
00:15:53,038 --> 00:15:54,362
Kiss!

369
00:15:56,293 --> 00:15:57,249
Annie!

370
00:16:03,148 --> 00:16:05,085
Oh, thanks, man. Just leave those.

371
00:16:05,086 --> 00:16:07,410
- I'll get them in the morning.
- It's okay.

372
00:16:09,586 --> 00:16:10,927
Are you wearing my underwear?

373
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:13,841
Oh. I just needed a pair while
I did some laundry here.

374
00:16:14,085 --> 00:16:15,528
I don't have a washing machine.

375
00:16:17,885 --> 00:16:19,041
What the hell?

376
00:16:19,075 --> 00:16:21,270
Whoa, whoa, whoa, don't get mad,
don't get mad!

377
00:16:23,224 --> 00:16:25,275
I'm homeless, Jeff, okay?

378
00:16:25,392 --> 00:16:26,831
When my wife found out
about Shirley and me,

379
00:16:26,832 --> 00:16:28,998
she kicked me out...
For good this time!

380
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:32,164
My whole life is in this dishwasher, man!

381
00:16:32,642 --> 00:16:35,042
Well, some of it's also soaking
in your bathtub.

382
00:16:37,118 --> 00:16:37,569
Oh...

383
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:39,436
So wasted and sleepy.

384
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:41,857
I could probably just crash here
and, you know,

385
00:16:41,858 --> 00:16:44,302
I can start looking for a place
in the morning.

386
00:16:46,016 --> 00:16:48,873
What... You orchestrated
this entire party

387
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:51,055
just so you could weasel
your way into staying here!

388
00:16:51,056 --> 00:16:52,237
You weren't even going to notice.

389
00:16:52,238 --> 00:16:53,733
Hey, Jeff, don't kill the messenger,

390
00:16:53,734 --> 00:16:56,731
but you have four hermit crabs
in your bathroom sink.

391
00:16:57,388 --> 00:16:59,637
You'll fall in love with them.
I named one Jeff.

392
00:16:59,638 --> 00:17:01,570
How long did you actually think
you were gonna stay here?

393
00:17:01,571 --> 00:17:04,679
Just a month. Three...Tops.

394
00:17:04,892 --> 00:17:07,088
I mean... how long is your lease?

395
00:17:16,331 --> 00:17:17,959
Way to go, idiots!

396
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:23,993
All right, everybody out.

397
00:17:23,994 --> 00:17:25,111
I'm not kidding.

398
00:17:25,796 --> 00:17:27,001
It's been very interesting

399
00:17:27,002 --> 00:17:30,379
getting to know you all much, much better.

400
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:33,067
Star-burns, Leonard, Magnitude.

401
00:17:33,068 --> 00:17:34,111
Pop, pop

402
00:17:34,531 --> 00:17:37,887
swizzle, scandalous, C Dubb, Tim.

403
00:17:37,954 --> 00:17:39,916
Mighty D. Glisten.

404
00:17:39,917 --> 00:17:41,592
Good night, everyone. Faster. Move it.

405
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:42,557
Thank you.

406
00:17:43,472 --> 00:17:44,429
Well...

407
00:17:44,641 --> 00:17:46,653
I hope you found tonight therapeutic,

408
00:17:46,654 --> 00:17:49,458
because I would love to pretend
that that was my plan.

409
00:17:50,396 --> 00:17:51,364
Well, I actually started to have fun

410
00:17:51,365 --> 00:17:53,687
until that maniac tried to move in.

411
00:17:53,885 --> 00:17:57,065
What is it about me that makes
broken people flock to me?

412
00:17:57,206 --> 00:17:58,393
Is it my height?

413
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,151
Do huddled masses mistake me
for the Statue of Liberty?

414
00:18:01,152 --> 00:18:02,094
I don't know.

415
00:18:02,095 --> 00:18:03,975
But being as how you're halfway through

416
00:18:03,976 --> 00:18:06,548
your second year at Greendale,
you may want to

417
00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:08,265
either stop resisting

418
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:11,203
or admit that you're actually
starting to enjoy it.

419
00:18:11,204 --> 00:18:12,744
Well, you assume I enjoy it

420
00:18:12,745 --> 00:18:14,840
because you think you'd enjoy it.

421
00:18:14,841 --> 00:18:17,622
That's true. I am very lonely.

422
00:18:20,689 --> 00:18:23,001
You want a, uh, nice little taste

423
00:18:23,002 --> 00:18:24,648
of what you're missing in a relationship

424
00:18:24,649 --> 00:18:25,903
with six nutcases?

425
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:27,903
- Yeah!
- Let's turn on my phone

426
00:18:27,904 --> 00:18:29,472
and listen to the 39 messages

427
00:18:29,473 --> 00:18:30,916
they left tonight.

428
00:18:31,506 --> 00:18:34,167
You have no new messages.

429
00:18:35,899 --> 00:18:38,135
Huh. That's...

430
00:18:39,571 --> 00:18:40,503
Huh.

431
00:18:41,266 --> 00:18:42,579
Since you've got it turned on,

432
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,870
why don't you call me a cab
and then pay for it?

433
00:18:45,193 --> 00:18:46,823
Must have been some kind of trouble.

434
00:18:47,721 --> 00:18:48,722
Ah...

435
00:18:49,239 --> 00:18:50,955
What a relief that would be.

436
00:18:52,855 --> 00:18:54,023
Tell you what, if you need me,

437
00:18:54,024 --> 00:18:56,356
I'm gonna be waiting for my cab down here.

438
00:18:57,985 --> 00:18:59,492
Having a special nap.

439
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:11,631
Oh!

440
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:29,279
Thanks, bro. I'll be gone in the morning.

441
00:19:29,695 --> 00:19:31,282
Yeah. Whatever.

442
00:19:31,283 --> 00:19:33,384
Okay. Maybe I stay a while.

443
00:19:36,423 --> 00:19:38,699
- Thirsty.
- Don't push it.

444
00:19:38,967 --> 00:19:39,946
All right...

445
00:19:40,807 --> 00:19:43,161
It might not shock you guys
to hear the real reason

446
00:19:43,162 --> 00:19:44,738
we had a fight today...

447
00:19:46,089 --> 00:19:47,954
It wasn't about the Barenaked Ladies.

448
00:19:47,955 --> 00:19:50,338
Although I do have some
unresolved issues there.

449
00:19:51,097 --> 00:19:53,537
Caring about a person can be scary.

450
00:19:53,709 --> 00:19:57,520
Caring about six people can be
a horrifying embarrassing nightmare.

451
00:19:57,521 --> 00:19:58,743
At least for me.

452
00:19:59,418 --> 00:20:00,931
But if I can't say it today,

453
00:20:00,932 --> 00:20:02,473
when can I say it?

454
00:20:03,317 --> 00:20:04,690
I love you, guys.

455
00:20:05,384 --> 00:20:06,879
Oh, and, Pierce...

456
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,385
Take it from an expert...

457
00:20:08,501 --> 00:20:11,057
These knuckleheads
are right outside your heart.

458
00:20:11,401 --> 00:20:12,721
Let them in.

459
00:20:13,469 --> 00:20:14,769
Before it's too late.

460
00:20:16,594 --> 00:20:18,024
Happy Valentine's Day.

461
00:20:25,067 --> 00:20:27,270
- Be mine?
- Right! Yes!

462
00:20:31,796 --> 00:20:33,494
- Love you.
- Amazing!

463
00:20:38,762 --> 00:20:39,754
You're cute?

464
00:20:40,722 --> 00:20:41,696
No, wait.

465
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:46,226
- Kiss me.
- There has got to be a way

466
00:20:46,227 --> 00:20:48,188
to make money off of this!

467
00:20:51,826 --> 00:20:52,885
I've been cheating.

468
00:20:56,592 --> 00:20:59,203
No. It says email me.
