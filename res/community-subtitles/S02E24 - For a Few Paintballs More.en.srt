What are we supposed to do?

00:14:53,085 --> 00:14:54,619
How 'bout we save
this school's ass?

Final order of business--

Pick a class we can all
take in the fall.

368
00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:49,751
We could just take Anthro 201.

369
00:16:49,818 --> 00:16:52,086
Too risky. Sequels are almost
always disappointing.

of playing it safe, Han?

Cool down, Annie.

because the context demanded it.

But here.

Oh. Star-Burns.

Yeah, he uses some kind
of crystal instead of deodorant.

Guys, I know exactly
what we should do.

00:17:09,371 --> 00:17:12,974
We should see what Troy
thinks we should do.

Thanks, man.

Okay. I've given this
a lot of thought,

381
00:17:21,316 --> 00:17:24,685
and I've decided
we should sleep on it.

382
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:27,755
Just came back
for my day planner.

383

Pretend I'm not even here.

You guys are great at that.

385
00:17:30,959 --> 00:17:34,495
Come on, Pierce. We all know
this is no "day planner."

Here it is.

387
00:17:35,697 --> 00:17:37,064
Now, if you'll excuse me,

388
00:17:37,132 --> 00:17:39,100
it appears I'm running late
to drink a bottle of wine

389

in my bathing suit.

390
00:17:40,169 --> 00:17:45,940
Pierce, wait.

391
00:17:46,008 --> 00:17:50,378
You know, I've been coming
to this school for 12 years.

392
00:17:50,446 --> 00:17:52,780
I've never been friends
with anyone here

393
00:17:52,848 --> 00:17:55,383
more than a semester.

394
00:17:55,451 --> 00:17:58,352
Probably for the same reason
I've been married seven times.

395
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:02,123
I guess I assume eventually
I'll be rejected,

396
00:18:02,191 --> 00:18:05,726
so I, you know,
test people, push them,

397
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:08,429
until they prove me right.

398
00:18:08,497 --> 00:18:10,031
It's a sickness.
I admit it.

399
00:18:10,098 --> 00:18:13,501
But this place
has always accepted me,

400
00:18:13,569 --> 00:18:14,602
sickness and all.

401
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:17,038
This place accepted all of you.

402
00:18:17,105 --> 00:18:18,806
Sickness and all.

403
00:18:18,874 --> 00:18:21,442
It's worth thinking about.

404
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,344
Um, I think we have
thought about it, Pierce,

405
00:18:23,412 --> 00:18:25,646
and you're right.

406
00:18:25,714 --> 00:18:27,582
And we were just picking a class

407
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:30,985
we could all be in this fall.

408
00:18:31,053 --> 00:18:33,688
And we'd love for you to join us.

409
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:37,525
No, thanks.

410
00:18:37,593 --> 00:18:39,126
I'm done with you guys.

411
00:18:39,194 --> 00:18:40,495
I like this school,

412
00:18:40,562 --> 00:18:42,697
but I'm done
with whatever you call this.

413
00:18:42,764 --> 00:18:46,968
Adios.

414
00:18:47,035 --> 00:18:48,736
- He was my ride.
- I'm going after him.

415
00:18:48,804 --> 00:18:50,171
No, he's just acting out.

416
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,273
I've seen this behavior before.

417
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:54,108
In cats.

418
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:56,611
- My--my cats.
- It's true.

419
00:18:56,678 --> 00:19:01,210
And now he'll come
slinking back in five,

420
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:05,686
four, three, two...

one of the storm troopers

424
00:19:39,527 --> 00:19:41,238
shot the others,
and it was Pierce.

425

And we won.
We saved Greendale.

- Sounds like you guys had a lot of fun.
- Yep.

427
00:19:46,773 --> 00:19:48,243
Honestly, I don't know how
we're gonna top it next year.

428
00:19:48,363 --> 00:19:50,464
Oh, I got a pitch.
Why use guns?

429
00:19:50,584 --> 00:19:52,501
Take a hose and spray
the whole school with paint.

430
00:19:52,621 --> 00:19:54,251
- Every inch of it.
- Actually, we kind of did that.

431
00:19:54,371 --> 00:19:55,280
Haven't you been to the library?

432
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,078
- I'm working my way there.
- Mm.

Oh, you can just
put that anywhere.

for the summer?

- No plans.
- Cool.
