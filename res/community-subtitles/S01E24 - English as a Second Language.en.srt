1
00:00:02,236 --> 00:00:04,261
<i>It's hard to believe
, but finals are here.</i>

2
00:00:04,472 --> 00:00:06,531
<i>And I know
that during this stressful time,</i>

3
00:00:06,741 --> 00:00:09,301
<i>my voice blaring over a PA
can't help.</i>

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,444
<i>Which is why,
for the next three days,</i>

5
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:14,876
<i>you'll hear nothing
but soothing sounds of nature.</i>

6
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:17,880
<i>And to kick it off,
here's a babbling brook.</i>

7
00:00:20,488 --> 00:00:22,922
Will anyone back me up
if I say this is ridiculous,

8
00:00:23,124 --> 00:00:25,183
<i>or is it gonna be
another Avatar situation?</i>

9
00:00:25,393 --> 00:00:27,987
<i>I love Avatar.
What's an avatar?</i>

10
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:29,856
Okay.
Nature sounds or not,

11
00:00:30,064 --> 00:00:32,191
we're not gonna have trouble
passing our Spanish final.

12
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,460
I've transcribed this semester's
notes from my digital recorder.

13
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:37,398
You record every class?

14
00:00:37,605 --> 00:00:38,799
Pfft. Spoiler alert.

15
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:40,906
You mean nerd alert.
Alert nerd.

16
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:44,907
Here's a spoiler. We're all gonna
spend the next three days boning up.

17
00:00:45,112 --> 00:00:47,910
Then pass the exam
and move on to Spanish 103.

18
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:49,707
Sounds like a good ending,
Annie.

19
00:00:49,917 --> 00:00:52,545
Except for where I take Spanish 103.
What do you mean?

20
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:54,744
Spanish 102 fills
my language requirement.

21
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:59,287
I guess I just figured
we're a Spanish study group,

22
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:02,087
so we'd keep taking Spanish
together.

23
00:01:02,296 --> 00:01:04,890
That's what I thought too, Annie.
I'm in.

24
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,897
I'm on a tight, four-year schedule
to replace my bachelor's.

25
00:01:08,102 --> 00:01:09,569
I'm not gonna take an extra class.

26
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,897
Spanish has value beyond credit.
Not really.

27
00:01:12,106 --> 00:01:13,937
I know the family downstairs
hates me.

28
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:16,200
I don't need to understand why.
Okay, fine.

29
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,002
You want me to say it?
I'll say it.

30
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:20,271
I like this group.
I want it to stay together.

31
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:22,608
Oh, I think so too.
Yeah, I like this group.

32
00:01:22,817 --> 00:01:24,978
Yeah, you be the cool guy, Jeff.

33
00:01:25,186 --> 00:01:26,380
And next fall
when that gets lonely,

34
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,851
I'll be in the front row of
Spanish 103.

35
00:01:30,391 --> 00:01:32,882
Monday through Friday,
6:00 a.m.

36
00:01:33,094 --> 00:01:34,254
Six...

37
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:39,963
<i>And now, crickets.</i>

38

39
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:15,763
Okay, if we're not interested
in Spanish 103 next year,

40
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:18,063
what about Anthropology?

41
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:22,173
Ooh. Anthropology,
the study of man.

42
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,577
I'm still trying to forget what
I learned about that subject.

43
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:26,609
Hee, hee. Go, girl.

44
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:29,078
You just go-girled yourself.
Shut up.

45
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:30,272
See, it's fun.

46
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:33,647
And they have a class at noon.
Noon, everybody.

47
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:36,220
Anthropology? Anthropology?
Anthropology?

48
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:39,119
Annie,
I'm not big on planning ahead,

49
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:41,317
but I have one
unmovable appointment

50
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:43,429
May 23rd, 2013.

51
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:44,655
To buy a flying car?

52
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:47,060
I have a table for one
at Morty's Steakhouse

53
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:49,259
where I will celebrate
becoming a lawyer again

54
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,405
which can only happen
if I take a full load.

55
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:53,664
Don't.

56
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:58,004
A full load of classes every year,
I can maybe make it until then.

57
00:02:58,212 --> 00:03:00,612
But not by building my schedule
around BFFs.

58
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:02,372
We'll build ours around yours.

59
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:05,552
Annie, you realize we'll be friends whether
or not we have a class together, right?

60
00:03:05,753 --> 00:03:09,245
Of course you think that.
Obvious from your name your parents smoked pot.

61
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:12,914
All right, well, I haven't said a
single word in this entire conversation

62
00:03:13,127 --> 00:03:14,890
and I find that outrageous.

63
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:17,495
<i>Hola, el losers.</i>

64
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:20,665
Winger, may I have a word
with you in private?

65
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:23,063
Sure.
Good.

66
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:28,207
Sorry.
Oh. Got it.

67
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:29,808
Got it. Cool.

68
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,076
Okay, come back in 10 minutes.

69
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:36,147
And if anyone asks,
I sent you to learn things.

70
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,945
And, Pierce,
close the door, please.

71
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:46,182
Other side of the door.

72
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:55,198
So you're here because your
college degree was fake, right?

73
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,893
I prefer the term better than real,
but yes.

74
00:03:58,105 --> 00:03:59,094
Two questions.

75
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:00,398
Where did you get it?

76
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:02,872
Could you have prevented
being caught, and how?

77
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:05,671
One question.
Where did you learn to count questions?

78
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,744
Are you telling me
you need a fake degree?

79
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:11,349
You know, in high school,
I was in a band.

80
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:12,917
We could've been huge,

81
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,521
but the world wasn't ready
for an Asian man on keytar.

82
00:04:17,558 --> 00:04:18,718
Did you say "keytar"

83
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:21,326
or did you just pronounce guitar
like a hillbilly?

84
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:24,429
Keytar. It's a keyboard
you can play like a guitar.

85
00:04:24,632 --> 00:04:26,964
Oh.
Get with the times, man.

86
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:29,397
Anyway,
next thing you know, I'm 32,

87
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:34,199
and I'm bagging groceries for,
like, 5 bucks an hour plus tips.

88
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:35,568
Shocked?
Confused.

89
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,209
I'm supposed to tip my bag boy?

90
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:39,038
So I did what anyone would do.

91
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:43,114
I faked my way into a job as a Spanish
teacher at a community college,

92
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:45,217
<i>relying on phrases
from Sesame Street.</i>

93
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:46,408
Oh, my God.

94
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,349
Save the judgment,
Winger, all right?

95
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:50,921
If the dean finds out
that I'm not a real teacher,

96
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,422
your grades are invalid,

97
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:55,186
and you'll all
have to repeat this class.

98
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:00,194
That was the chair.

99
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:01,800
Good.

100
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:03,026
Good.

101
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:13,671
It's unsolvable.

102
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:43,306
Hold on. I forgot my...

103
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,034
Hey. What the hell
are you doing?

104
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:47,777
Hey.
Hey, come back here.

105
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:49,846
Come back here.

106
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:53,751
Jerry. Hey, Jerry,
check this out.

107
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:02,127
<i>And that is what
Milton was really saying.</i>

108
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:03,887
<i>Okay, exams are on Tuesday.</i>

109
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:05,895
<i>Class dismissed.</i>

110
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:11,535
<i>If the dean finds
out that I'm not a real teacher,</i>

111
00:06:11,739 --> 00:06:13,036
<i>your grades are invalid,</i>

112
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,731
<i>and you'll all
have to repeat this class.</i>

113
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:19,877
<i>If the dean finds out
that I'm not a real teacher,</i>

114
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,377
<i>your grades are invalid,</i>

115
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:24,142
<i>and you'll all
have to repeat this class.</i>

116
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:27,242
<i>That was the chair.</i>

117
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:28,887
Right.

118
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,753
Hi, everybody. Hi.

119
00:06:35,963 --> 00:06:38,090
I'm afraid I have some
bad news for you, kids.

120
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:42,160
Well, it's actually bad news
for the older people as well.

121
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:44,098
Señor Chang is no longer with us.

122
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:47,831
Um. He's not faking his death again, is he?
Because I can't handle that.

123
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:51,238
First, he's alive. Then we're happy.
And then he's alive again and...

124
00:06:51,445 --> 00:06:53,037
I received an anonymous tip

125
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:57,616
that Chang had misrepresented
certain aspects of his qualifications.

126
00:06:57,818 --> 00:06:59,615
For instance, having them.

127
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:03,256
Word of advice, if an Asian man
says he's a Spanish teacher,

128
00:07:03,457 --> 00:07:06,654
it's not racist to ask for proof,
okay?

129
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:10,387
You ignore your mother's voice
and get right into that horse's mouth.

130
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,656
So if Chang's a fraud,
what about our grades?

131
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:14,663
Are they invalid?
Oh, no, no, no.

132
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:16,165
That's not fair to you guys.

133
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:19,032
I'm sure you've all worked
very hard and learned.

134
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:21,901
So just take your final
with Chang's replacement.

135
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:24,241
Doctor.

136
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,326
<i>Sí.
Buenos días.</i>

137
00:07:54,374 --> 00:07:55,432
<i>Sí.</i>

138
00:07:55,943 --> 00:07:57,843
Listen to this back and forth.

139
00:07:58,045 --> 00:07:59,342
It's like I'm at an embassy.

140
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:01,580
What's on the final?

141
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:06,246
I know it's in Spanish,
dummy. What chapters?

142
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:08,512
All three or?

143
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:10,849
<i>Veinte.
Oh, I know that one.</i>

144
00:08:11,058 --> 00:08:13,788
She wants a large coffee.
Oh. She's thinking.

145
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:15,685
Okay, in English.

146
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:19,662
You will be taking a standard exam
for students at your level.

147
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:22,199
It will cover this entire textbook.

148
00:08:24,071 --> 00:08:25,766
<i>El crappo.</i>

149
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:34,881
I couldn't understand a word Dr.
Escodera was saying.

150
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:37,346
And why is she teaching
Spanish if she's a doctor?

151
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:38,540
Go cure something.

152
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:42,521
I gotta pass that exam or my entire
four-year plan will be thrown off.

153
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:45,157
That might be your car, Jeff.
What?

154
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:48,260
My route for the 4th of July,
fireworks set off the car alarms.

155
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:50,987
That one sounded like a new Lexus.
My Lexus isn't brand-new.

156
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:52,460
I know. Yours is a 2002.

157
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,327
That's the year I heard it.

158
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:00,061
Hey.

159
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:02,670
You two-faced jag.

160
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,470
You're wearing protective
goggles to destroy my car?

161
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,544
Safety first.
Stop.

162
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:10,046
I ask you for help
and you turn me in?

163
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,582
What? I did not.
Why would I screw myself?

164
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:14,686
What am I, Dr. Drew?

165
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:17,823
I didn't do it, okay?

166
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:21,424
Then tell me who did it
so I can murder your face.

167
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:23,755
Hey, break it up.

168
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:27,161
Oh. Oh, oh. We're writing a song.
For the battle of bands.

169
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:37,675
Good luck passing
your exam, Winger.

170
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:39,869
At one point,
I was teaching you Klingon.

171
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,538
Yeah? Why don't you tell that to your
really weird-sounding magical chair.

172
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,048
I have a condition.

173
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:50,218
I'm peeing. I'm peeing. I'm peeing.

174
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:12,200
Impressive.

175
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:14,437
I dismantled that valve
and I put out that free cake

176
00:10:14,648 --> 00:10:16,343
because I wanted to see
what you could do.

177
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,609
You got a gift, kid.
You know that, right?

178
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:20,517
A gift for sinks.

179
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:21,949
Big deal.

180
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:23,622
I'm a student. I like learning.

181
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:25,251
Yeah, right. Learning.

182
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:26,653
Learn everything.

183
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,794
Learn until you're dead.

184
00:10:28,996 --> 00:10:32,955
Or you can call this number.

185
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,598
Now, that's a company
that fixes toilets and sinks.

186
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,235
Oh, man.
Listen to me.

187
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:39,871
Toilets and sinks, real things,

188
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:43,440
things that people always use
and always need to get fixed.

189
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:46,135
This is a life, kid, a real one.

190
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:48,405
Doing something that matters,
something that makes sense.

191
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:51,584
The only thing that
makes sense is this.

192
00:10:51,785 --> 00:10:53,548
Learning, thoughts.

193
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:55,915
So I can think,
and get a student loan,

194
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:58,956
and grind my own coffee,
and understand HBO.

195
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:02,322
You don't have to do that, kid.
You're special.

196
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,529
You could be a plumber.

197
00:11:08,568 --> 00:11:10,502
You could be a plumber.

198
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:18,000
Hey.
Hi.

199
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:24,475
Okay, so we know
three kinds of verbs,

200
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:25,982
which took 40 minutes.

201
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:29,383
At this rate, if we don't sleep or pee, we
can cover about 10 percent of the exam.

202
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:32,524
If it's multiple choice,
25 percent of guesses will be right.

203
00:11:32,726 --> 00:11:36,628
Actually, that's a lot of right answers
when you're guessing almost everything.

204
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,826
I don't wanna sound like a defeatist,
but we're defeated.

205
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,398
Oh, come on, Jeff.

206
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:43,330
Face it.
Why even take the exam?

207
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:45,698
We're all gonna be
retaking Spanish this fall.

208
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:51,206
What was that?
What was what?

209
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:54,380
I don't know. I said retake
Spanish and everyone went, "Ugh."

210
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:56,412
And you went, "Hmm."

211
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:58,775
It's one of those recessive genes.

212
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:01,010
I can also curl my tongue.
Who else?

213
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:08,426
Annie ratted out Chang.
What?

214
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:11,995
You made this happen because you're obsessed
with all of us being together next year.

215
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:13,723
I wouldn't say I was obsessed.

216
00:12:13,934 --> 00:12:16,835
Permission to treat witness hostile?
I'll allow it.

217
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,335
Did you record
yesterday's Spanish class?

218
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:25,342
I don't think so.
Abed?

219
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:29,140
You said you record all your classes.
Pierce called it a spoiler alert.

220
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:32,717
You heard Chang tell me
he was bogus.

221
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,181
And then dropped the dime

222
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:37,413
because you would do anything
to keep this group together,

223
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:40,593
because you are insecure.

224
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:44,927
Because you didn't get hot
until after high school.

225
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:47,391
That's true.

226
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:49,195
Fine. I did it.

227
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:51,461
For real, Annie?
Oh, Annie.

228
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:54,572
Make her a dude so I can punch her.
Go ahead and hate me.

229
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:59,144
We were all gonna drift apart.
You were all too cool to do anything.

230
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:02,406
Maybe not too cool, maybe just,
you know, not psycho enough.

231
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:03,640
Yeah, a little crazy.
A little psycho.

232
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:06,151
Now she is going to make
the Disney face.

233
00:13:06,353 --> 00:13:07,513
Her lip is gonna quiver

234
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:10,713
and her eyes will flutter, but
they won't ever actually close.

235
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:12,653
But do not feel sorry for her.

236
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:16,620
She stole a year of our lives,
and we're right to be pissed.

237
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,320
Oh, Annie.

238
00:13:18,532 --> 00:13:19,658
No. No.

239
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:21,424
Everyone close their eyes.
Do it.

240
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:24,604
Close them. Abed, close.

241
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:29,299
Oh, don't worry about me.
I can only connect with people through movies.

242
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:31,170
She's the Ark of the Covenant.

243
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:32,968
You guys, I'm sorry.

244
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,740
I only did it
so that we could stay friends.

245
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:38,008
Picture her as Paul Giamatti.

246
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:41,318
I mean, he's... Heh.

247
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:43,489
Friends don't do what you did to us.

248
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:46,916
Did the sisterhood of the traveling
pants poison each other's food

249
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:49,061
so they were too sick to leave?
No.

250
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:53,130
I've never seen it, but I'm pretty sure
they mailed each other pants.

251
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,766
I said I was sorry.

252
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:57,402
Who cares if you're sorry?
We're still screwed.

253
00:13:57,604 --> 00:14:00,334
Be sorry about this stuff
before you do it.

254
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,632
Then don't do it.

255
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:03,366
It's called growing up.

256
00:14:03,577 --> 00:14:05,670
We were gonna see each other
all the time.

257
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:08,177
Yeah, that's what
my rehab group used to say.

258
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:11,316
The only one that keeps in touch is the guy
that sells jewelry made out of bottle caps.

259
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:15,249
I had hoped that this group would
amount to more than passing hellos

260
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:17,286
and whatever the hell this is.

261
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:21,953
Nobody even think
about going after her.

262
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:24,187
That's what she wants,
more personal drama

263
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:27,662
so we fail the exam
and stay in Spanish forever.

264
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:29,267
We have to beat her.

265
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:32,336
Don't text her. Don't call her.
Don't mention her.

266
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:35,337
We do not need her to study.

267
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:43,876
Does anybody know how to study?

268
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:46,518
Annie usually...
Whose side are you on?

269
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:55,456
<i>Happy finals week, Greendale.</i>

270
00:14:55,662 --> 00:14:58,426
<i>Continuing
our stress-reducing nature sounds,</i>

271
00:14:58,632 --> 00:15:02,261
<i>that's cut five
from Sounds of the Serengeti.</i>

272
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:07,270
<i>Here's a B-side from that album,
"Antelope Slaughter at Ndutu."</i>

273
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,205
Oh, God.
Did we miss the exam?

274
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,573
No, it starts in 40 minutes.

275
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:19,382
I can't wake up Pierce.
Is this gonna take an unexpected turn?

276
00:15:19,853 --> 00:15:22,378
You have to know how to do it.
Discrimination lawsuit.

277
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,216
Preposterous.

278
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,221
Should we call Annie?
Absolutely not.

279
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,792
Keep your eyes on the prize
and let her grow up.

280
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:30,986
I'll see you all at the exam.

281
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:32,687
Wait for me, Britta.

282
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:36,131
I was with you in the bathroom.
You're with me everywhere.

283
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:40,102
Troy, I know you could be a plumber.
I'm not gonna be, okay?

284
00:15:40,307 --> 00:15:42,673
I'm gonna be sophisticated
and have no job,

285
00:15:42,876 --> 00:15:45,504
or a job that looks from a distance
like I do nothing.

286
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:47,942
Troy, you know what
the best part of my day is?

287
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:52,852
Ten seconds from the time I sit in
Spanish to the time I look at your desk.

288
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:57,547
Because I think maybe I'll
look and he won't be there.

289
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:08,600
Between our studying for 12 hours,
and Pierce being asleep for 11,

290
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:10,667
I think we may actually
stand a chance.

291
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,100
My horoscope
predicted suffering.

292
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,797
No, no, that's good.
Horoscopes are the devil trying to trick us.

293
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:17,670
Mm-hm.
Oh.

294
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:35,090
Yeah. That make you happy?
Why aren't you at your desk?

295
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:38,628
Because I don't wanna sit near you
because you're a bad friend.

296
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:42,199
He said the best part of his day
is when he thinks I won't be there.

297
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:45,598
Abed, what a terrible thing to say.
It's from a movie.

298
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:47,500
Then the movie it's from
is terrible.

299
00:16:50,977 --> 00:16:51,966
Where's Annie?

300
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,646
Oh, I sent her a text,
but she hasn't responded yet.

301
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:57,214
Shirley, what did I tell you?
Don't play into her ploy for attention.

302
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:00,109
What does it say?

303
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,686
She says she's fine
and this isn't a ploy for attention.

304
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:06,552
She's sorry. She does need to grow up,
starting by making things right with Chang.

305
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,818
Oh, no.

306
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:09,359
What?
He'll kill her.

307
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:23,673
Who cares about a stupid exam?

308
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:25,174
We're a study group.

309
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:26,845
And Annie's our friend.

310
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:36,585
I'm friends with Hannah too.

311
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:38,417
The whole class is.

312
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:41,150
And you can't have
an exam without a class.

313
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:42,487
Right, guys?

314
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:44,219
We love Hannah.

315
00:17:44,431 --> 00:17:46,023
<i>We love Hannah.</i>

316
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:49,668
<i>We love Hannah.
We love Hannah.</i>

317
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:52,963
No!

318
00:17:53,173 --> 00:17:55,698
No!

319
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:58,343
Oh, no.
The devil told the truth.

320
00:18:02,115 --> 00:18:03,582
Okay.
Whoa.

321
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:06,881
Winger, what the hell?
What was that screaming?

322
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:09,681
I was showing Annie
the magic of electronic sampling.

323
00:18:12,392 --> 00:18:14,690
We thought
you were murdering her.

324
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:18,125
Annie getting me fired was the best
thing that ever happened to me.

325
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:20,795
She's helping me
re-plan my life.

326
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,865
She's got a real mind
for stuff like this.

327
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:25,663
We're gonna find Ben a job so he
can stay at Greendale as a student

328
00:18:25,872 --> 00:18:29,433
and work on his teaching degree.
And music classes, you know?

329
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:31,906
Maybe get the band back together,
huh?

330
00:18:34,514 --> 00:18:37,074
Oh. Listen to that.

331
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:39,979
Yeah. Music lessons
would be great for you.

332
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:43,121
Oh, thanks, Britta.

333
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:47,117
Now, go pass that test.
Heh, heh, heh.

334
00:18:51,865 --> 00:18:53,799
Well, it was kind of easy, right?

335
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,695
Yeah, I think I might have passed.

336
00:18:55,902 --> 00:18:58,928
Jeff, I can never forgive myself
for what I did.

337
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:03,576
Look, I treated you like
a child for having feelings.

338
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:07,944
Maybe because that's, you know,
when I stopped having them.

339
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:09,137
But you shouldn't.

340
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:13,752
You don't have to be a kid
to admit that you like people.

341
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:16,945
And you don't have to dress
like this to grow up.

342
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:18,818
You look like a travel agent.

343
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:20,281
You don't like it?

344
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:23,485
I was going
for more of a professor thing.

345
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,022
What? Why?

346
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:26,220
What?
Nothing.

347
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:29,424
I think I got half of it, which
got me through the half I didn't.

348
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:32,332
<i>Like the first season of The Wire.
Exactly the...</i>

349
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:34,268
Ah, hell, I can't stay mad at you.

350
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:38,907
I think I nailed it.
Oh, me too.

351
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:44,646
I'm feeling pretty confident.
I think we're gonna make it.

352
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:48,218
Still, we should plan
for the worst-case scenario.

353
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:49,752
Because if we do all pass,

354
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:52,083
that means next year,
we won't have a class together.

355
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:55,420
So we're gonna need a backup.

356
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:59,296
Anthropology? Anthropology?
Anthropology?

357
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,225
Anthropology?
Heh, heh, heh.

358
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:04,528
Anthropology.
Anthropology.

359
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:06,932
I want you to be in my next film.

360
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,073
"Barnes, Troy: 68."

361
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:12,244
Bennett, Shirley: 81.

362
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:14,470
Edison, Annie: 95.

363
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:17,149
Hawthorne, Pierce: 70.

364
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:20,148
Nadir, Abed: 85.

365
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:22,518
Perry, Britta: 79.

366
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,553
"Winger, Jeff..."

367
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:28,388
I'm sorry, Jeff.

368
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:30,695
I'm sorry for the
half-hearted mislead, 80.

369
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:33,661
We all pass Spanish.
That's nice.

370
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,599
Not to take anything away
from anyone,

371
00:20:35,802 --> 00:20:38,202
but didn't the test seem
extra easy?

372
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,099
I don't know.
Uh-uh.

373
00:20:44,811 --> 00:20:50,078
Hey, thanks for making it easy.

374
00:20:50,283 --> 00:20:55,118
I was going to say the same to you,
but you were gone before breakfast.

375
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:56,879
I'm an early riser.

376
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,921
I'll say.

376
00:20:59,305 --> 00:21:05,919
