00:00:02,228 --> 00:00:04,783
Pierce, you made us all drive
to a warehouse

2
00:00:04,784 --> 00:00:06,205
in the middle of nowhere.

3
00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:07,373
You could at least tell us why.

4
00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:08,667
Hey, I know as much as you.

5
00:00:08,686 --> 00:00:09,337
I got a letter

6
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,376
from the executor
of my father's estate.

7
00:00:11,398 --> 00:00:13,493
It said to come out here
with my seven closest friends.

8
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:14,407
You brought six.

9
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:15,682
Well, who else
was he gonna bring?

10
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:17,016
Levar Burton was a maybe.

11
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,434
Mr. Hawthorne.
[All gasp]

12
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:20,053
I apologize.
Gilbert.

13
00:00:20,054 --> 00:00:22,138
Even from the grave,
my father's got you

14
00:00:22,139 --> 00:00:24,423
by the short and curly
salt and pepperies.

15
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:26,726
My name is Gilbert Lawson.

16
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:29,746
I was Cornelius Hawthorne's
assistant for over 30 years,

17
00:00:29,747 --> 00:00:31,597
and before that,
I was just the teenager

18
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:33,316
who read the Bible to him
in the bath.

19
00:00:33,317 --> 00:00:34,317
- Ew.
- All right, all right.

20
00:00:34,318 --> 00:00:35,451
It's inheritance time.

21
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,620
How 'bout that check,
soul brother?

22
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:39,038
Your father did leave you
something,

23
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,773
but it's more of an activity.

24
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:43,042
Thank you for keeping it
as creepy as possible.

25
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,711
This looks like a multi-player
gaming interface.

26
00:00:44,712 --> 00:00:45,745
I've heard enough.

27
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:49,332
Oh, that diabolical
old fossil face.

28
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:51,751
I asked him for money
to invest in video games

29
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:53,285
back in 1979.

30
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:55,788
Cornelius spent over 30 years
developing a video game for you.

31
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:57,874
It was his dying wish

32
00:00:57,875 --> 00:01:00,143
that you and seven of your
closest friends would play it.

33
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:01,761
Lavar Burton was a maybe.

34
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:03,396
So, please, choose a seat.

35
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:04,764
Cool.

36
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:08,267
So a 100-year-old man designed
a 30-year-old video game?

37
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:09,519
This I've got to see.

38
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,970
Once you're seated
behind your computers,

39
00:01:10,971 --> 00:01:12,188
a photograph of you
will be taken

40
00:01:12,189 --> 00:01:14,907
and an avatar will be made
from your likeness.

41
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,309
I didn't bring my likeness.

42
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:23,616
All right, everyone,
let's begin.

I assume nothing
because I'm not racist.

Aww! We're adorable!

Why did this thing take photos

if it was going to completely
fabricate random body shapes?

Before we engage,

we should hang back and study

Piercinald, in 1980,

101
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:39,869
you said that video games,
not moist towelettes,

102
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,504
were the business
of the future.

103
00:03:41,505 --> 00:03:45,041
Today, moist towelettes are
stocked in every supermarket,

while arcade after arcade
closes.

105

He's got a point.

106
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:50,313
Nevertheless,
I designed this game

107
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:51,714
to be played upon my death

108

- His inheritance? What?

- Why not?

Because when you're friends
with someone for three years,

it's weird to steal
their family's money.

how you intend to stop me.

How about if we come over
there and kick your ass?

Go get him, Troy.

Be my guest.

167
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:36,702
But 30 seconds after you
leave your chairs,

168
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:38,487
the weight sensors
will recognize it

169
00:05:38,488 --> 00:05:39,822
as an automatic forfeit.

170
00:05:39,823 --> 00:05:41,490

Let's go!

- What?

- No, Pierce!
- Please, no!

We need you!

Just let me die.

188
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,558
Pierce, so Gilbert
knows a couple tricks.

189
00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:17,793
Big deal.
We outnumber him.

190
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,463
And most importantly,
while he's fighting for greed,

191
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:22,198
we're fighting for friendship,

192
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:24,500
which means we can't lose,
okay?

193
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:27,570
- Okay.
- Okay!

Everybody
keep Pierce protected.

We have to get him to the Throne
of Hawkthorne before Gilbert.

198
00:06:40,313 --> 00:06:41,863
And don't forget, when you die,

199
00:06:41,864 --> 00:06:43,931
you go all the way back
to the study room.

200
00:06:43,932 --> 00:06:45,900
So... Don't die.

201
00:06:45,901 --> 00:06:47,602
Good pep talk, Jeff.

202
00:06:47,603 --> 00:06:49,103
Yeah, I used to love dying,

203
00:06:49,104 --> 00:06:50,772
but that speech really
turned me around.

I owe Jeff that.

I can help with that.

The throne is in Castle
Hawkthorne, north of here.

You unlock the castle with the

which you must free
from the black caverns.

You think dad was into meth?

You can usually get supplies

Man, why can't my mom be here?

I never believed her.

Everybody split up

Hilda's parents lived there.

Yeah, if you're looking
for equipment, tough luck.
