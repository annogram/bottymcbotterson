1
00:00:01,133 --> 00:00:02,177
It's settled.

2
00:00:02,342 --> 00:00:05,272
Urinals in the women's restroom
will be turned into planters.

3
00:00:05,429 --> 00:00:08,312
On to chores.
We need some able bodies...

4
00:00:08,474 --> 00:00:10,479
...to clear out a space
in the storage room.

5
00:00:10,642 --> 00:00:11,816
- I'll do it.
- Really?

6
00:00:11,977 --> 00:00:13,614
Annie goes from easy chores
to hardest.

7
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:14,814
That's true.

8
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,451
- I'll do it too.
- Yeah, me too.

9
00:00:16,607 --> 00:00:19,287
- Okay, that concludes this meeting.
- Oh, man.

10
00:00:19,443 --> 00:00:22,077
Nobody picks up on my patterns.
What am I gonna say next?

11
00:00:22,237 --> 00:00:23,958
Graham cracker. You didn't know.

12
00:00:24,114 --> 00:00:27,293
Hey, it's the... couple.

13
00:00:27,451 --> 00:00:28,839
Rachel got Pile of Bullets.

14
00:00:28,994 --> 00:00:31,462
Interactive Old West-themed
VCR game from the '90s.

15
00:00:31,622 --> 00:00:32,832
I found it at Goodwill.

16
00:00:32,998 --> 00:00:35,632
Between a Thighmaster
and a Dick Tracy Burger King glass.

17
00:00:35,792 --> 00:00:37,595
- Happy anniversary.
- Anniversary?

18
00:00:37,753 --> 00:00:40,683
- I guess I should learn your name, lady.
- Oh, Rachel.

19
00:00:40,839 --> 00:00:43,520
Rachel. Nice to meet you, Rachel.
You can go.

20
00:00:43,675 --> 00:00:45,266
Okay.

21
00:00:47,012 --> 00:00:49,693
- Anniversary?
- Been dating for one of your months.

22
00:00:49,848 --> 00:00:52,352
Our relationship is 12 times
more efficient, so a year.

23
00:00:52,518 --> 00:00:54,938
Sleep cycles are in sync,
communicate with eyebrows.

24
00:00:55,103 --> 00:00:57,358
She knows my Netflix password.
Jeff's password.

25
00:00:57,523 --> 00:00:59,195
- I'm changing that.
- I changed it.

26
00:00:59,358 --> 00:01:00,401
- To what?
- Nice try.

27
00:01:00,567 --> 00:01:02,454
Can Rachel come to our place
to play this?

28
00:01:02,611 --> 00:01:05,375
- Can't afford to take her anywhere.
- My brother's in town...

29
00:01:05,531 --> 00:01:06,788
...and I'm broke too.

30
00:01:06,949 --> 00:01:08,621
I was gonna make him dinner tonight.

31
00:01:08,784 --> 00:01:11,370
Cool. Double date?
Dinner and 1993 interactive VCR game?

32
00:01:11,537 --> 00:01:13,339
- What are you making?
- Salmon.

33
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:16,887
- Buttered noodles.
- Buttered noodles are my favourite.

34
00:01:17,376 --> 00:01:21,386
Quick announcement
for two of Greendale's finest.

35
00:01:21,547 --> 00:01:24,726
Payday is postponed until next week,
so this...

36
00:01:26,135 --> 00:01:28,768
...is my freestyle rap apology.

37
00:01:28,929 --> 00:01:31,349
Well, I'm a peanut bar
And I'm here to say

38
00:01:31,515 --> 00:01:33,567
Your cheques will arrive
On another day

39
00:01:33,725 --> 00:01:35,813
Another day, another dime
Another dollar

40
00:01:35,978 --> 00:01:38,113
Another stuffed shirt
With another white collar

41
00:01:38,272 --> 00:01:40,074
Criminals, Wall Street
Taking the pie

42
00:01:40,232 --> 00:01:42,569
And all the black man gets
Is a plate of white lies

43
00:01:42,734 --> 00:01:44,905
Prisons recruiting them
Police be shooting them

44
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:47,324
Rap artists looting them
Labels all diluting them

45
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:49,411
Barack Obama is scared of me

46
00:01:49,575 --> 00:01:52,255
'Cause I don't swallow knowledge
And I spit it for free

47
00:01:52,411 --> 00:01:54,498
Let me clear my throat

48
00:01:55,581 --> 00:01:58,215
I don't know what that was, I don't.

49
00:01:58,917 --> 00:02:01,219
I don't know what that was.

50
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

51
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:43,342
So nice to have the Edison kids
under one roof again.

52
00:02:43,504 --> 00:02:45,591
Remember when we used to
cut carrots for Mom?

53
00:02:45,756 --> 00:02:47,393
- Yes.
- I need a soda.

54
00:02:47,549 --> 00:02:49,222
Oh, okay.

55
00:02:49,676 --> 00:02:51,847
One, two, three.

56
00:02:53,472 --> 00:02:54,646
Door's busted.

57
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:58,318
- Landlord's in jail and money's tight.
- Yeah.

58
00:03:07,236 --> 00:03:08,577
Oh, my God.

59
00:03:08,737 --> 00:03:11,667
- Anthony, thank you.
- Yeah.

60
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:13,994
Hey, Abed, a quick word?

61
00:03:16,995 --> 00:03:19,214
What would you think about
my brother moving in?

62
00:03:19,373 --> 00:03:21,923
- Do I just keep cutting carrots?
- Yes, Anthony.

63
00:03:22,084 --> 00:03:25,346
- He has money. He's handy.
- You're putting me on the spot.

64
00:03:25,504 --> 00:03:28,352
My concern would be he's a Viking,
might only use our home...

65
00:03:28,507 --> 00:03:30,512
...as a temporary base
before moving inland.

66
00:03:30,676 --> 00:03:34,270
A good guy. We can't afford to keep
splitting the rent. Have a better idea?

67
00:03:34,429 --> 00:03:35,983
- How about Rachel?
- That a joke?

68
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,183
Is it cool if I poop?

69
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:41,027
No, Anthony. Just cut the carrots.
You've been dating Rachel for a month.

70
00:03:41,186 --> 00:03:43,737
I don't think you heard his question.
The answer is yes.

71
00:03:45,524 --> 00:03:47,825
We have been dating
for the equivalent of a year.

72
00:03:47,985 --> 00:03:49,954
I've been hearing about that
for two years.

73
00:03:50,112 --> 00:03:54,252
Can't microwave a relationship like a
burrito. Ain't living with your girlfriend.

74
00:03:54,408 --> 00:03:58,288
Ain't living with your "keep cutting
carrots or ask if he can poop" brother.

75
00:03:58,453 --> 00:04:00,957
Rachel's on her way.
I'd like to practise my smile.

76
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:05,218
I guess it was just air.

77
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:14,019
Why are we organising
a storage room?

78
00:04:14,178 --> 00:04:17,061
- How is this not a janitor's job?
- Can I ask you something?

79
00:04:17,222 --> 00:04:19,524
Why the hell do you have
all those muscles...

80
00:04:19,683 --> 00:04:22,068
...if you're gonna bitch
about moving boxes?

81
00:04:22,227 --> 00:04:25,609
Is the air working in here? I'm sweating
like a Catholic on Judgement Day.

82
00:04:25,772 --> 00:04:29,652
- A little Protestant humour. Got more.
- Oh, can't wait.

83
00:04:31,403 --> 00:04:32,447
Nothing.

84
00:04:32,738 --> 00:04:35,835
Wait. There's something in there
blocking the vent.

85
00:04:36,158 --> 00:04:37,202
You gonna open it?

86
00:04:37,367 --> 00:04:40,915
You realise nothing good has ever
been found in a vent, right? It's a vent.

87
00:04:55,511 --> 00:04:58,559
"Intro to Chemistry." Third edition.

88
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:04,437
Mint. Two hundred dollars retail...

89
00:05:04,603 --> 00:05:07,866
- ...160 on the street.
- Why are there books in an air duct?

90
00:05:08,023 --> 00:05:10,953
Why is there hot sauce
in the bathroom? It's Greendale.

91
00:05:11,109 --> 00:05:12,949
- Must be stolen.
- Have to tell the dean.

92
00:05:13,111 --> 00:05:14,404
Hold on.

93
00:05:14,571 --> 00:05:18,628
Let's just calm down
and have a slow, pleasant chat...

94
00:05:18,784 --> 00:05:20,041
...about possibilities.

95
00:05:20,202 --> 00:05:23,381
- What kind?
- All kinds. Anything is possible.

96
00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:25,129
We might one day have hover cars.

97
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:29,466
Kale might be poisonous. And we might
not have to get the dean involved here.

98
00:05:29,628 --> 00:05:31,716
- Jeffrey, these are stolen.
- From who?

99
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,601
By who? How long ago?

100
00:05:33,757 --> 00:05:36,723
It's "from whom," "by whom."
But he nailed the third question.

101
00:05:36,885 --> 00:05:40,433
Look, we are the committee
that deals with Greendale's problems.

102
00:05:40,597 --> 00:05:43,480
You see anything on our list
about a pile of missing books...

103
00:05:43,642 --> 00:05:45,481
...worth more than the school
they're in?

104
00:05:45,644 --> 00:05:48,907
One thing's for sure. If we hand
these over, they'll really go missing.

105
00:05:49,064 --> 00:05:51,698
Think that money's gonna be used
to cut our pay cheques...

106
00:05:51,859 --> 00:05:54,492
...or to make another
rapping peanut costume?

107
00:05:54,653 --> 00:05:57,157
- I can't believe what I'm hearing.
- Wanna go to heaven?

108
00:05:57,322 --> 00:05:59,624
- Walk away, more for us.
- I'm an accomplice now.

109
00:05:59,783 --> 00:06:01,835
I'll only get into heaven
by turning you in.

110
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:04,841
But what about your restaurant?
What about your kids?

111
00:06:05,831 --> 00:06:09,177
Ms. Bennett, when God talks to you,
what language does he use?

112
00:06:09,334 --> 00:06:12,383
Because in my experience, when he
thinks you deserve something...

113
00:06:12,546 --> 00:06:14,847
...he drops it on you
like a ton of bricks.

114
00:06:20,637 --> 00:06:25,941
All right. But if we're gonna do this,
we're gonna do this clean and safe.

115
00:06:26,101 --> 00:06:28,023
We're gonna move these
to my restaurant...

116
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:30,274
...sit on them
until we know they're cold.

117
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:33,536
Price them through a third party
and unload them in a single score.

118
00:06:33,692 --> 00:06:36,705
None of that nickel-and-dime crap.
I don't wanna leave a trail.

119
00:06:36,862 --> 00:06:38,203
- Yeah, great.
- Yeah, great.

120
00:06:38,363 --> 00:06:41,211
- Wonderful.
- Okay. Let's count these babies up.

121
00:06:41,366 --> 00:06:42,458
Yeah, great.

122
00:06:42,951 --> 00:06:44,541
When we were kids...

123
00:06:44,703 --> 00:06:46,839
...Anthony and I would play
Time Machine.

124
00:06:46,997 --> 00:06:50,046
We would go, "Oh, no.
We're in barbarian times.

125
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:52,712
Quick. Back to the time machine."

126
00:06:52,878 --> 00:06:57,054
And then we would run
back to the time machine.

127
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,057
It's true.

128
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:03,018
That's why Abed is like a brother
to me. You guys are alike.

129
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,019
I can't accept that based on one story.

130
00:07:05,182 --> 00:07:08,065
Rachel, did you tell Annie
about your Waterpik?

131
00:07:08,727 --> 00:07:11,741
I suppose now
is as good a time as any.

132
00:07:11,897 --> 00:07:13,238
I own a Waterpik.

133
00:07:13,398 --> 00:07:16,163
Annie has one too. You guys care
for your teeth same amount.

134
00:07:16,318 --> 00:07:18,038
Share a bathroom, it'd go smoothly.

135
00:07:18,195 --> 00:07:21,410
- Anthony could fix our cabinets.
- Rachel used to mop floors at Kmart.

136
00:07:21,573 --> 00:07:24,207
This a real conversation
or are we bugged by the feds?

137
00:07:24,368 --> 00:07:25,578
Abed.

138
00:07:26,578 --> 00:07:28,168
Sidebar.

139
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,421
What do you think happens
after you die?

140
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:37,259
- I don't know.
- You're lucky.

141
00:07:39,424 --> 00:07:42,105
- Stop trying to sell me on Rachel.
- Stop pitching Anthony.

142
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:45,274
- You're like ice cream cake. Overkill.
- We need a roommate.

143
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,558
- I vote Rachel.
- Anthony.

144
00:07:46,723 --> 00:07:48,859
- Flip a coin?
- Coins create parallel timelines.

145
00:07:49,017 --> 00:07:51,735
- Rock, Paper, Scissors?
- That's a nine-sided coin.

146
00:07:52,771 --> 00:07:54,194
What about Pile of Bullets?

147
00:07:54,356 --> 00:07:55,946
You wanna decide on a roommate...

148
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:59,785
...with a 1993 Old West-themed
VCR game?

149
00:08:00,529 --> 00:08:03,792
Rachel or I win, Rachel moves in.
You or Anthony win, I'll surrender...

150
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:07,662
- ...count down days until he eats me.
- All right, it's settled.

151
00:08:09,496 --> 00:08:12,260
- Is this working?
- It's a handshake in progress.

152
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,547
Who wants to play Pile of Bullets?

153
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:15,801
- Not me.
- You have to.

154
00:08:15,961 --> 00:08:18,049
- We don't have to.
- Not okay. We do have to.

155
00:08:18,213 --> 00:08:19,554
One day we'll tell you why.

156
00:08:19,715 --> 00:08:21,720
For now,
let's simply retire to the TV area.

157
00:08:21,884 --> 00:08:24,470
For the highest stakes
1993 interactive VCR game...

158
00:08:24,636 --> 00:08:26,891
...of your entire young adult lives.

159
00:08:31,268 --> 00:08:33,154
Okay, let's see what you got.

160
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,407
Yeah. Okay.

161
00:08:43,572 --> 00:08:45,162
I know somebody that knows people.

162
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:48,207
I can get you a price per book,
find a buyer and make a deal.

163
00:08:48,368 --> 00:08:50,255
- For half.
- That's ridiculous.

164
00:08:50,412 --> 00:08:52,168
I'm assuming more than half the risk.

165
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:53,921
- Half is fair.
- Not really.

166
00:08:54,082 --> 00:08:56,633
Because they're ours,
all 100 percent of them.

167
00:08:56,793 --> 00:08:59,095
Giving you half is not fair, it's silly.

168
00:08:59,254 --> 00:09:01,509
Okay, good luck.
You wanna re-blindfold me?

169
00:09:01,673 --> 00:09:03,761
I know we're in E-9 in the east wing.

170
00:09:03,926 --> 00:09:06,476
I know that
because it smells like weed.

171
00:09:06,637 --> 00:09:08,190
Not my weed.

172
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:11,146
Look, I'm willing to give her half.

173
00:09:11,308 --> 00:09:13,776
- You can have half of Jeff's share.
- Not what I meant.

174
00:09:13,936 --> 00:09:15,775
You're offering her half of the total.

175
00:09:15,938 --> 00:09:18,655
Either half of all of our money
or half of your share.

176
00:09:18,816 --> 00:09:20,821
Either way, you walk
with about 16 percent.

177
00:09:20,984 --> 00:09:22,112
- Not fair.
- Damn right.

178
00:09:22,277 --> 00:09:24,532
Here's what is:
25 percent for each of us.

179
00:09:24,696 --> 00:09:26,037
Take it or leave it, Britta.

180
00:09:26,615 --> 00:09:28,702
Legalize it

181
00:09:28,867 --> 00:09:30,374
Don't Chang...

182
00:09:31,995 --> 00:09:33,585
Hey, guys.

183
00:09:36,834 --> 00:09:37,877
Hey.

184
00:09:38,043 --> 00:09:41,222
Look, if something sketchy
is happening, I don't care.

185
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,883
So I'm just gonna back out...

186
00:09:44,049 --> 00:09:46,350
- ...of the room now and...
- He can't leave.

187
00:09:46,802 --> 00:09:47,846
No! No!

188
00:09:48,011 --> 00:09:51,060
I didn't see anything.
I did not see anything.

189
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:54,071
- Britta, find some rope.
- I've got rope.

190
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:56,729
"Each player starts
with six bullet tokens...

191
00:09:56,895 --> 00:10:00,906
...10 gold certificates,
and a colour-coded posse token."

192
00:10:01,066 --> 00:10:02,407
There's two types of tokens?

193
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:04,074
I'm sure we'll figure it out.

194
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:06,448
Howdy.

195
00:10:06,613 --> 00:10:08,915
You look like a real group
of gunslingers.

196
00:10:09,074 --> 00:10:13,001
Everyone in town's mighty scared
what with all the gold and the outlaws.

197
00:10:13,162 --> 00:10:16,923
- Only one of us can make it out alive.
- Are we robbing the town?

198
00:10:17,082 --> 00:10:20,131
By now, you should have
your bullets, your gold...

199
00:10:20,294 --> 00:10:22,595
...and two Wild West tokens each.

200
00:10:22,754 --> 00:10:24,676
Hang on to those tokens
no matter what.

201
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,679
- There's two kinds of tokens.
- Two each?

202
00:10:26,842 --> 00:10:29,227
Now, when you hear
the word "draw"...

203
00:10:29,386 --> 00:10:31,854
...or see a square
with a colour or number matching...

204
00:10:32,014 --> 00:10:35,775
...one of you or your opponent's cards,
the first one of you to say "bang"...

205
00:10:35,934 --> 00:10:39,945
...wins the challenged player's token
and the amount of their bid in gold.

206
00:10:40,105 --> 00:10:41,861
- What's going on?
- Ready?

207
00:10:42,024 --> 00:10:43,115
- Yes?
- I'm not.

208
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:54,964
- We supposed to be bidding?
- Draw!

209
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,374
- I bid.
- Rattler.

210
00:10:57,539 --> 00:10:58,631
- Bang five.
- Bang?

211
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:02,129
- Bang-bang five.
- Not bad.

212
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:05,307
Collect your tokens
and let's get on to the next round.

213
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:07,801
- What you doing?
- He said, "collect your tokens."

214
00:11:07,966 --> 00:11:11,146
- He can't see you.
- Didn't Abed shoot whoever's five?

215
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:12,810
Draw!

216
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:16,437
Odd-numbered players,
give up two cards! Draw!

217
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,190
We have numbers?

218
00:11:18,352 --> 00:11:20,820
Okay. Okay, I don't think
we're doing this right.

219
00:11:20,979 --> 00:11:22,949
Sure this is a game
and not some art film?

220
00:11:23,106 --> 00:11:24,827
- What do we do?
- Rewind, start over.

221
00:11:24,983 --> 00:11:26,823
Okay, I'll allow it.

222
00:11:26,985 --> 00:11:29,405
No, it's okay.
We gave it our best shot, no?

223
00:11:29,571 --> 00:11:31,826
I'm sorry, Rachel, is this your home?

224
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,331
Oh, God, no, I'm sorry.

225
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:35,663
- We're playing.
- But it doesn't make any sense.

226
00:11:35,953 --> 00:11:39,050
- Sounds like Anthony wants to forfeit.
- He doesn't. Don't forfeit.

227
00:11:39,206 --> 00:11:40,713
Rachel, we can do this.

228
00:11:40,874 --> 00:11:42,844
- Just focus, okay?
- Okay.

229
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:44,628
Okay.

230
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:48,141
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

231
00:11:49,258 --> 00:11:52,188
I love textbooks.
That's why I stole these.

232
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:53,851
- All right, knock it off.
- What?

233
00:11:54,012 --> 00:11:58,521
You gotta make it sound believable
or you're not getting out of here.

234
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:01,649
- I'm trying.
- Try harder. Go.

235
00:12:04,189 --> 00:12:06,111
I love textbooks.

236
00:12:06,275 --> 00:12:07,485
That's why I stole them.

237
00:12:09,236 --> 00:12:11,206
Look at this one.

238
00:12:12,489 --> 00:12:14,541
Stolen textbooks are the best kind.

239
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,792
I stole all these books and put them
in this room so I could come kiss them.

240
00:12:18,954 --> 00:12:20,544
That's all, thank you.

241
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:23,505
Please, I'm on parole.

242
00:12:23,667 --> 00:12:27,179
Exactly. So keep your mouth shut
or we'll send this file to everybody.

243
00:12:27,337 --> 00:12:32,308
- What do you mean "everybody"?
- Everybody.

244
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,941
- I can't do this anymore.
- What?

245
00:12:36,096 --> 00:12:40,319
I'm out. It's too far, it's too evil.

246
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:42,398
Look, you guys can split the money.

247
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:44,068
I'm just gonna leave quietly.

248
00:12:44,229 --> 00:12:45,653
Goodbye.

249
00:12:51,195 --> 00:12:53,413
- What the hell? What the hell?
- Yeah?

250
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:55,411
I can't let you leave until we're done.

251
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:58,077
This is not what God
wants you to be doing today.

252
00:12:58,243 --> 00:13:01,755
We had our chance to think about that.
He dropped this like a ton of bricks.

253
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:03,966
- Right, Hickey?
- Oh, yeah, definitely.

254
00:13:04,124 --> 00:13:06,260
Not to say that this isn't getting insane.

255
00:13:08,086 --> 00:13:10,423
Blackhat Bill
sure ain't the forgiving type.

256
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:12,392
- You! Green player!
- Yes, partner?

257
00:13:12,549 --> 00:13:14,601
- You can do better than that.
- Yes, partner.

258
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,272
- Pick a player that you wanna draw.
- I choose Anthony. Draw a card.

259
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:22,438
Keep this
for when you're in quick draw.

260
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:24,191
- Rachel, your turn.
- What do I do?

261
00:13:24,353 --> 00:13:25,444
You roll. Here.

262
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:27,823
- There. My turn.
- Stop. Snake bite. Lose a turn.

263
00:13:27,981 --> 00:13:29,025
Anti-venom.

264
00:13:29,191 --> 00:13:30,698
- I'll take two.
- Draw!

265
00:13:30,859 --> 00:13:32,449
- I bid five bullets. Eleven.
- Six.

266
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:33,785
Pass. Reverse.

267
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:34,989
Hold it!

268
00:13:35,155 --> 00:13:37,243
Did you remember to say "yee-haw"?

269
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:39,911
Anyone that didn't loses a turn.

270
00:13:40,077 --> 00:13:41,797
Collect your coins.

271
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:44,801
I'll trade you two snakes for a bullet.
Just say yes.

272
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:47,377
- I don't wanna die.
- Stop her, Rachel, stop her.

273
00:13:47,543 --> 00:13:48,966
No. Bid five.

274
00:13:49,127 --> 00:13:51,180
- Tornado!
- Tornado!

275
00:13:51,338 --> 00:13:52,382
Nine, tornado.

276
00:13:52,548 --> 00:13:53,722
- Pass. Seven.
- Reverse.

277
00:13:53,882 --> 00:13:54,926
- Two tornado.
- Pass.

278
00:13:55,092 --> 00:13:56,645
- Double.
- Draw!

279
00:13:58,887 --> 00:14:00,809
- Come on. You son of a bitch.
- Come on.

280
00:14:02,307 --> 00:14:03,980
- Come on, come on.
- Come on, come on.

281
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:05,317
Come on.

282
00:14:08,063 --> 00:14:09,985
If one of you rolled
your bullet number...

283
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,620
...you're the winner.

284
00:14:11,775 --> 00:14:15,536
Fast-forward to the red screen
to get your gold.

285
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:19,120
Well, more food for the buzzards.

286
00:14:19,283 --> 00:14:20,624
Looks like modern times...

287
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:24,464
...have come after all.

288
00:14:24,621 --> 00:14:25,665
See you in the city.

289
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:27,255
I wanna go home.

290
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:28,969
- Me too.
- We have to play again.

291
00:14:29,126 --> 00:14:31,843
Abed, I think you're having
one of your special times.

292
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:34,507
- I'm gonna give you space.
- Want you to move in here.

293
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:37,354
But that's not resolved.
Anthony might move in, so...

294
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:41,103
- We want one of you to live with us.
- Settling it with Pile of Bullets.

295
00:14:41,346 --> 00:14:43,149
That is not an explanation...

296
00:14:43,307 --> 00:14:45,691
...that should make anybody
want to live here.

297
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:50,492
I don't like this side of you...

298
00:14:50,647 --> 00:14:53,365
...and I do not like that side
of VCR technology.

299
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:55,696
I am glad that it's a dead medium.

300
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:57,866
That was very uncomfortable.

301
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,165
I don't really know
how girlfriends work...

302
00:15:05,329 --> 00:15:08,093
...but I don't think
you have one anymore.

303
00:15:15,631 --> 00:15:18,680
Okay, cool. See you there.
I'm meeting my guy in an hour.

304
00:15:18,842 --> 00:15:21,560
He wants to see a sample,
set a price then do the exchange.

305
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:24,735
Oh, brother. Britta doesn't know
how much she's getting...

306
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:28,733
...from this guy none of us will ever see
again. She knows one thing for sure.

307
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:31,575
She'll be right back with it
so you can divvy it up...

308
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,866
...even stephen.

309
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:40,408
Man, that's rich. What's supposed to
stop her from robbing you guys blind?

310
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:43,502
- What are you gonna do, call the cops?
- I'll go with her.

311
00:15:43,659 --> 00:15:46,672
- Oh, yeah. Good plan.
- Leave Hickey, two of you do the deal.

312
00:15:46,829 --> 00:15:49,759
Yeah, what the hell? When
did I volunteer for Guantanamo duty...

313
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:51,920
...while you two traipse off...

314
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:54,303
...to the Cuban equivalent
of Las Vegas?

315
00:15:54,461 --> 00:15:55,754
Havana, right?

316
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:58,056
Don't listen to Jeff.
He's trying to divide us.

317
00:15:58,215 --> 00:16:01,596
Says the woman who's willing
to take care of the cash by herself.

318
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,350
As if you're Mr. Trustworthy.

319
00:16:03,512 --> 00:16:05,683
Why do you have
so much access to rope?

320
00:16:05,848 --> 00:16:08,778
You're the one who left the door
unlocked so Chang could get in.

321
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:12,066
- You didn't do that on purpose?
- Guys. Guys.

322
00:16:12,229 --> 00:16:14,946
Calm down.
I'm sure we can work this out.

323
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:18,453
We just need to stay cool
and talk it through.

324
00:16:19,069 --> 00:16:20,113
I'm sorry.

325
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:23,292
That didn't work out the way I planned.

326
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:26,249
I'm sorry.
But you didn't leave me any choice.

327
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:29,624
You were acting poorly, I didn't know
if I could trust you anymore.

328
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:31,758
You dragged me into this.

329
00:16:31,915 --> 00:16:33,837
I didn't want this.

330
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,642
- You're packing?
- Yeah.

331
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,556
- You're leaving?
- Yeah.

332
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:45,060
Because of last night?

333
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,806
Yeah. I just think there's
some unresolved issues here.

334
00:16:48,599 --> 00:16:49,940
You're right.

335
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,197
I'm still really hurt
by Mom turning her back on me...

336
00:16:53,353 --> 00:16:55,156
...when I went to rehab.

337
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:58,161
And I guess part of me
was mad at you...

338
00:16:58,317 --> 00:16:59,658
...for siding with her...

339
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:03,828
...so I thought you moving in here
was some kind of moral victory.

340
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:08,165
What? No. Unresolved issues involving
the black guy in all these photographs.

341
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:10,332
- Troy?
- Hey, I don't know his name, man.

342
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:13,081
I just know he's clearly left
some kind of vacuum.

343
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,676
And screw you.
What did I have to do with Mom?

344
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:17,674
I was 13.

345
00:17:23,926 --> 00:17:27,140
- Hey.
- Hi. I'm here to do my third-act apology.

346
00:17:27,304 --> 00:17:29,190
- I don't think...
- Wait. Don't reject it...

347
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:31,269
...until the whole thing's
been served up.

348
00:17:33,268 --> 00:17:34,360
Open your locker please.

349
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:44,202
Hey.

350
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:46,202
- Hey.
- I wanna tell you something.

351
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:47,408
This is adorable.

352
00:17:47,574 --> 00:17:50,255
Just because it's adorable
doesn't mean it's not important.

353
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:53,625
Listen. I've been accelerating
our relationship.

354
00:17:53,789 --> 00:17:56,339
I've been worried
I wouldn't pass a lot of the tests.

355
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,386
Because I thought
if Annie was around...

356
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:02,007
- ...I'd have less chance of screwing up.
- You're not screwing things up.

357
00:18:02,589 --> 00:18:04,310
That's good to know.

358
00:18:04,466 --> 00:18:07,563
The problem with me will always be
that I can never know for sure.

359
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:11,516
Not a huge amount of people in my life
that haven't eventually kicked me out...

360
00:18:11,682 --> 00:18:15,858
...and I don't always see it coming.
I don't want it to happen with you.

361
00:18:16,145 --> 00:18:18,399
Don't manipulate me,
don't keep secrets from me...

362
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,900
...and we'll probably be okay.

363
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,990
Cool.

364
00:18:23,861 --> 00:18:25,035
It stopped raining.

365
00:18:27,156 --> 00:18:28,709
Yeah, it sure did.

366
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:33,919
You hired a stunt person.

367
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,716
No, I did not.

368
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:39,591
Where'd you get these?

369
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:41,922
They were an inheritance
from my father.

370
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:44,260
He was a collector.

371
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,012
- How many?
- A hundred and twenty.

372
00:18:47,509 --> 00:18:49,929
- Well, for the whole bunch, maybe 20.
- Thousand?

373
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:51,222
- Dollars.
- $20,000?

374
00:18:51,388 --> 00:18:53,524
Twenty non-thousand dollars.
Regular dollars.

375
00:18:53,682 --> 00:18:58,606
Might get that from a recycling place.
These are misprints. Check page 105.

376
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,906
Well, I can't
because there's no page numbers.

377
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:02,994
Well, that would be a problem.

378
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:06,033
You know, "Class, turn to page..."
"There is no page."

379
00:19:06,195 --> 00:19:09,374
"Oh, well, if there's no page number,
you can't turn to it, so..."

380
00:19:09,531 --> 00:19:12,035
I have better things to do with my life.

381
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:28,805
Though we haven't been saying it...

382
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:32,313
...Troy was an important part
of our apartment. He kept the peace.

383
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:34,061
Yeah.

384
00:19:34,223 --> 00:19:36,643
Going a little crazy without him.

385
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:39,312
Maybe we need to live with a therapist.

386
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:41,448
Or at least someone crazier than us.

387
00:19:49,738 --> 00:19:52,752
- Let's give Craigslist another try.
- Craigslist is the way to go.

388
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:55,662
You guys all wearing
the same clothes from yesterday?

389
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:58,331
- We've been through some stuff.
- We learned something.

390
00:19:58,497 --> 00:19:59,671
No, we didn't.

391
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:02,002
We learned that sometimes
there's no lesson.

392
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,468
- How's that learning?
- We played Pile of Bullets.

393
00:20:04,628 --> 00:20:07,048
- Get this meeting over with?
- How'd the cleanup go?

394
00:20:07,214 --> 00:20:09,136
Don't step, don't step to me

395
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:12,182
I like coffee and water
Don't step to me

396
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:13,732
Damn it, I lost it.

397
00:20:13,887 --> 00:20:15,524
I lost it!

398
00:20:19,059 --> 00:20:21,693
Okay. I will get back to you. Thanks.

399
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:23,360
- Who was that?
- They want me...

400
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:26,701
...for that Wild West videotape
board game thing.

401
00:20:27,568 --> 00:20:30,118
- Pile of Bullets?
- Yeah.

402
00:20:31,738 --> 00:20:35,701
Devon, you pick up that phone now
and tell them you want this part.

403
00:20:36,118 --> 00:20:40,128
These VCR games
is where everything is headed.

404
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:45,093
Can't you see that?
You just became the Luke Skywalker...

405
00:20:45,252 --> 00:20:46,675
...of the new Star Wars.

406
00:20:46,837 --> 00:20:48,391
- We've gotta move.
- We do?

407
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:52,141
Oh, yes, indeedy.
We have got to move to Los Angeles.

408
00:20:52,301 --> 00:20:53,854
But I work here.

409
00:20:54,011 --> 00:20:56,810
Oh, please.
You call Apple Computers work?

410
00:20:56,972 --> 00:20:59,309
What kind of company
offers "stock options"...

411
00:20:59,475 --> 00:21:01,230
...as a Christmas bonus?

412
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:02,864
That ship is sinking.

413
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:08,076
Sweetie, remember when
we were talking about trying cocaine?

414
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:09,407
Yeah.

415
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:12,831
I think we should start
looking for some right now.

416
00:21:12,988 --> 00:21:15,752
Because we're gonna be able
to afford it.

417
00:21:15,908 --> 00:21:18,162
Okay. I mean, if you're sure.

418
00:21:18,327 --> 00:21:21,589
I've never been more sure
about anything in my entire life.

419
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:23,834
Pile of Bullets.

420
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:25,210
Pile of Bullets.

421
00:21:26,627 --> 00:21:27,670
Oh, yes.

422
00:21:28,305 --> 00:21:34,384
