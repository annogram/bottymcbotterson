1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:04,338
And Andre is going as Han Solo.

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,799
The boys are Stormtroopers
and little baby Ben is an Ewok.

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,137
- You don't have enough children.
- Happy Halloween parties.

4
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:13,805
You all look great. Ham.

5
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:15,474
Pig. Let me guess.

6
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:18,894
You're a flimsy excuse to be shirtless,
wearing silk underwear.

7
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:21,146
And you're as wrong
as you are welcome.

8
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:23,982
No, this year I planned
a two-person costume with Annie.

9
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:25,984
She's going as my ring girl.

10
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,949
- Pretty freaky-deaky, huh?
- Annie, no.

11
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:33,575
The boxing match ring girl.

12
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,661
The sexy ones
that hold the round numbers.

13
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:39,540
Yeah, see, this is why
we can't just text about it, Jeff.

14
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:41,083
I don't watch sports.

15
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,961
- There's no boxer in The Ring.
- I don't watch scary movies.

16
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:47,965
"And that's why we leave the couples'
costumes to the couples"...

17
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:50,092
she said wisely.

18
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:51,802
Warn your boyfriend's boyfriend.

19
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:54,513
We're dating. Doesn't mean
we do everything together.

20
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:56,348
You need to do some things
together.

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,100
We do some things.

22
00:00:58,392 --> 00:00:59,392
We do a lot of things.

23
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:01,353
Not all the things.

24
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:03,855
Things.

25
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:07,526
Okay, we're all here, minus Pierce,
who wasn't invited to Vicki's party...

26
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:09,778
for reasons beyond our control
or concern.

27
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,364
No mystery there.
She put a pencil through his face.

28
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,826
- Does Vicki have a TV?
- It's a party. No watching TV.

29
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:18,346
No, I'll be watching Annie.
She watches Cougar Town reruns.

30
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,790
Makes Annie my third-favourite show.
And tonight is their Hallo-wine special.

31
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,543
That's right.
Better not miss the merlot.

32
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:27,296
Clink. What? You fall into it.

33
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:31,550
That was Pierce. He accidentally locked
himself in his panic room. He needs our help.

34
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:32,843
No "oh."

35
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:35,929
"Oh" means we are going
against our will, and we are not going.

36
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:37,514
- He's lying.
- He seemed upset.

37
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:40,726
He's been alone up there in that
mansion ever since I moved out...

38
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:44,021
and his dad,
you know, got killed by Jeff.

39
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:47,941
Calling for help.
A classic call for help.

40
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,777
"Hello, Dr. Perry's office.
Damaged psyche?

41
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,362
Yes, I'll accept the charges."

42
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:55,574
Heads, lock up your brains.
Britta's on the prowl for therapy meat.

43
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:58,493
Maybe we should just stop by
on our way to the party.

44
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,663
I assure you, the only thing Pierce
is trapped in is adolescence.

45
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,081
He's a geriatric toddler...

46
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,751
throwing the most
elaborate tantrums money can buy.

47
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:08,045
And I for one
am not gonna stand by...

48
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:12,382
and allow some lonely ridiculous
person to derail our group's plans.

49
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:15,093
Dean, dean, dean!
To your corners, fighters.

50
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:18,513
Someone save me a towel.

51
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,932
You guys going to Vicki's party?

52
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,393
We just gotta do this thing first.

60
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,346
Holy Helen, this place is huge.

61
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:02,140
Seems spookier than I remember.

62
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:05,227
The only thing spooky
about this place is the tacky decor.

63
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,772
It's like David Lee Roth
threw up Miami Vice.

64
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,148
So tacky.

65
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,027
Maybe Pierce isn't doing so well
since he lost his father...

66
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,322
and then his inheritance
in a video game battle with Gilbert...

67
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,908
an illegitimate half-brother
he never knew he had.

68
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,619
- I guess I've never said it out loud.
- Guys, over here.

69
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,455
Hawthorne's panic room,
one of the 27 stops on the tour...

70
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:28,250
I had to memorize
before moving into Hawthorne Manor.

71
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,669
- Does the house get visitors?
- You're the first.

72
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:34,297
Impenetrable titanium carbonite door,
hacker-proof key-code access panel...

73
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,591
impressive video telecom screen
with remote.

74
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,302
Maximum occupancy one,
with female companion.

75
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:42,347
Purchased June 30th, 1989.
It took me forever to remember that.

76
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,226
June 30th, 1989. Theatrical release
of Do the Right Thing.

77
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,104
Wait, it might be a trap.

78
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:50,564
Or it might let him out.

79
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:53,191
- Either way, we...
- Oh, put a sock in it, shorts.

80
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,821
- Oh, hey, guys.
- Pierce, are you okay?

81
00:03:58,113 --> 00:03:59,531
Oh, sure, fine, fine.

82
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:04,119
I was dusting in here and I must have
bumped a switch or something.

83
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:07,038
As the graceful one in the group,
I'm kind of embarrassed.

84
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,958
Don't be. I've been locked
in way worse places than this.

85
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,127
Oh, not against my will.

86
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:13,419
Been in there long?

87
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,298
No, not long, but I couldn't
remember the damn code.

88
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,885
Sorry to be a burden on you guys,
but I guess that's all I am now.

89
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,220
It's okay. We're happy to help.

90
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,556
- No sweat, Boba Fett.
- Yeah. Do you have a TV?

91
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:27,893
What Abed means is did you write
the code down anywhere?

92
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:32,063
Yes, it's in a red notebook
in my study...

93
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,398
or my bedroom, maybe.

94
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,943
I used to know where everything was
before I fired my maid.

95
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,904
Now there's no reason
to use my safe.

96
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,072
We'll find it. It'll take two secs.

97
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:44,034
Or we take one sec
and just skip to the catch.

98
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:46,036
This place hasn't been dusted
in months.

99
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:48,038
He starts with the panic room?
No sale.

100
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,582
He's not a sad old man.
He's a sad old liar.

101
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:53,001
- Jeffrey!
- No, no, he's right.

102
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,836
I've been lying to you.

103
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,798
The truth is, last night,
I got up to get a glass of red wi...

104
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,425
Water, and on my way
back from the cellar...

105
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,636
I saw something that scared me
so badly...

106
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:04,721
I locked myself in here
on purpose.

107
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,599
The part about not remembering
the code is true.

108
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:10,060
- I'm very thirsty.
- Why didn't you call me sooner?

109
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:12,938
I had to come up
with that awesome dusting story...

110
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,941
because if you knew
what spooked me...

111
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:18,360
you'd probably call me
crazy and old.

112
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,237
No one's gonna call you, Pierce.

113
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:23,031
You can tell us.
We're here to help you.

114
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:25,075
I thought I saw my dad.

115
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,119
Looked like his face was coming
right through the wall.

116
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:32,916
But that's impossible,
because my dad is dead.

117
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:38,797
I mean, not "Aha, your dad is dead,"
but "Aha, I knew it."

118
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:43,301
Ghost dad, exploring your haunted
mansion for secret codes?

119
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:46,555
Nice try, Pierce.
You gotta be kidding me.

120
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,974
What in the Scooby-Doo
is happening to you people?

121
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:50,934
Go to the party.
We'll meet you there.

122
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:53,728
- We're gonna stay and help Pierce.
- He doesn't need help.

123
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,231
He needs attention.
Are you really this naive?

124
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:57,566
Am I naive?

125
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:00,819
I'm sure as stuff
not your sexy little ring girl.

126
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:02,654
- I...
- Can it, ham.

127
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,823
She's also my ride.

128
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:13,081
- Troy said...
- Pierce's bedroom is the third door on the left.

129
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,500
I didn't leave my short-term memory
at Coachella.

130
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,961
- Jeez, Winger, keep it above the belt.
- I'm sorry.

131
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:19,253
Already forgotten.

132
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,630
This house is getting to me.

133
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,341
Kind of weird that a dead person
used to live here.

134
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,760
What's weird is that a living person
lived here...

135
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,804
with his parents well into his 60s...

136
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:31,099
then they died and he's still here
like a paralyzed Peter Pan.

137
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,144
Not for long. I'm gonna set
my shrink ray to "daddy issues"...

138
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:36,479
and blast that sucker
full of closure.

139
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,148
- I guess it can't hurt.
- Exactly.

140
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,192
Because in one way or another,
therapy is always helpful.

141
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:44,279
No, because there's no possible way
you could mess him up worse.

142
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:47,198
It's like practising on a cadaver.
Knock yourself out.

143
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,075
This has gotta be it.

144
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:52,746
Wish I didn't have
so much exposed skin.

145
00:06:58,001 --> 00:06:59,628
Tubular.

146
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,547
I, too, lack the adjectives.

147
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:05,550
How does one search...

148
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,887
for a red notebook that doesn't exist
without looking, touching...

149
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,699
- or creating future nightmares?
- I'll check the nightstand.

150
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:14,559
I'll check my messages.

151
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:15,894
Oh, my God.

152
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:18,897
Pierce keeps his dad's bow tie
by his bed.

153
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:23,068
- Table for Siggy Freud, party of...
- Britta, stop answering phones.

154
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,862
How about we ask Rip van Racism
where the codes are?

155
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,656
- Don't. That's not nice.
- What?

156
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:31,242
He was a tightfisted, philandering
bigot who got to outlive most bridges.

157
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:34,245
We don't owe him reverence.
How about it, you old bag of dust?

158
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:35,664
You got our numbers?

159
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,875
- I'm serious, stop it.
- You don't really believe in ghosts?

160
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,086
I'm just not so quick to rule it out.

161
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:44,589
I believe people can be haunted
by unresolved issues in their past.

162
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,592
- Issues don't turn into ghosts.
- Maybe for Pierce, they have.

163
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,595
Maybe Pierce and his dad have
seriously unfinished business.

164
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,014
No, the dead can't have business.

165
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:56,434
They can't want or think or do.
It's what makes them dead.

166
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,728
It's the living
who choose to be haunted.

167
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,273
Cornelius was barely a dad.
Now he's nothing.

168
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,401
Pierce can keep staring
into that void...

169
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:07,654
or he can turn around,
face his future like I did, and say:

170
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:11,116
"Who gives a crap who my dad was?
I'm my own man now."

171
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:14,786
Wow, pretty slick, Britta.

172
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:18,123
Using ghosts to trick me into
opening up. Too bad it didn't work.

173
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:22,794
Oh, man,
so this is what the zone feels like.

174
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,546
Analyse this.

175
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:30,760
We don't wanna go over
the same area twice, so be thorough.

176
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,721
Thorough. Got it.

177
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:39,269
More of a burnt umber,
but I won't hold that against him.

178
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:42,313
"Pierce Hawthorne's
ideas for ladies"?

179
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,482
Oh, please.

180
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,948
"Blonde, long legs,
with tennis racquet."

181
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,451
Asian Rockette.

182
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:57,203
"Big boobs, redhead, but doctor,
question mark."

183
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,456
Oh, he's not 100 percent
on that one?

184
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,626
This is the greatest thing
that has ever happened to me.

185
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,881
Okay, I don't have the codes.

186
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:11,301
Maybe Shirley and Troy
are having better luck in the library.

187
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,265
Abed?

188
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,311
Abed?

189
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:27,942
If this is supposed to be like that part
in that movie that's like this...

190
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:31,321
I would like to remind you
that I don't watch scary movies...

191
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:35,658
and therefore cannot appreciate
the homage!

192
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,712
Abed?

193
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:59,057
I hate reference humor.

194
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:05,772
Hold on. I've been offended
by this coat rack before.

195
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:07,690
- Are we going in circles?
- Okay.

196
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:10,401
So maybe I spent a little less time
in the library...

197
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:15,657
than, say, the walk-in cereal closet,
but it's definitely near here.

198
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:19,035
- Skipped this door.
- Pierce told me not to go in there.

199
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:22,247
Then it's probably the library.
Racist son of a...

200
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,084
Sodom and Gomorrah.

201
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,628
It's Pierce's special gym.
He never let me use it...

202
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,755
- because he thinks I'm a child.
- Hold...

203
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,341
He's hiding the indoor swing
and I'm the child.

204
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:36,970
No, Troy, get out of there.

205
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,347
Why does he have so many collars?

206
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,266
Secret dogs.

207
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:42,851
It's okay. Come on.

208
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,143
Oh, no.

209
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:46,938
Forget you saw that,
and then forget I knew what it was.

210
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,940
You won't tell me,
Pierce won't tell me.

211
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,234
I have no idea what to Google.
I'll never know.

212
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:54,445
Dating Britta, you'll know too much
too soon, soon enough.

213
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:57,991
- What does Britta have to do with this?
- Well, she's a modern woman...

214
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:01,536
with experienced tastes.
I think it's nice you two are dating.

215
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,663
I hope she doesn't make you
feel pressured.

216
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:06,332
- Pressured to what?
- To fulfil her expectations.

217
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:07,625
Expectations of what?

218
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:09,919
Never mind.

219
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,213
Unsatisfied with what?

220
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:30,648
I lost Abed.
I turned around and he disappeared.

221
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,317
Never let him out of your sight.

222
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,736
That goes double for holidays
and wax museums.

223
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,780
- How are we gonna find him?
- I don't know, but we have to.

224
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,908
He's probably
already looking for us.

225
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:46,623
Oh, well, that's Hallo-wine
in Cougar Town for you.

226
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:50,001
Oh, ladies, I'll follow you anywhere.

227
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:54,589
- I do not have daddy issues.
- You get two minutes.

228
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,467
- Denial is the first step to acceptance.
- That can't be.

229
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,135
- Says the deny-ist.
- Not a word.

230
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,471
Keep digging.
Confronting your daddy issues now...

231
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:04,182
could prevent you from ending up
haunted like Pierce.

232
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:05,850
- I won't be Pierce.
- Won't you?

233
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,852
- No, I'm nothing like him.
- Aren't you?

234
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,479
- Gonna keep doing that?
- Am I?

235
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:12,273
The worst therapist?
No, because you're not a therapist.

236
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,818
Since you're misdiagnosing by a mile,
let me point out some differences.

237
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,862
Pierce was raised by his dad.

238
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,614
Mine took off when I was 8.

239
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,867
Pierce spent his life begging
for scraps of his father's approval.

240
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,703
I moved on.
Maybe Pierce needs a dad, I don't.

241
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,038
- Don't you?
- Stop that!

242
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,499
Okay, if I need a dad so bad...

243
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,210
how come I've had his
phone number for three weeks...

244
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:34,671
without the slightest urge
to call him?

245
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:36,506
You found your dad?

246
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:40,134
- Did I?
- Give it here!

247
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,346
I remember when this show was
about a community college.

248
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:51,312
No, you keep the fish sticks,
senator.

249
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,231
Enjoy the boat show.

250
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:58,319
Cool.

251
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:01,906
Cool, cool, cool.

252
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,744
Just let me see the number!

253
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,579
- For medical purposes!
- No!

254
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:11,499
Help me heal your heart hole!

255
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,168
- Never!
- Jeffrey...!

256
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,839
So this is where Pierce
has been hiding the taste.

257
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,014
Here's to you, Cornelius.

258
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:27,932
Gone, but not forgiven.

259
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,945
Of course.
Otherwise it wouldn't be pointless.

260
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:45,950
This is pointless.

261
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:50,830
We have no Abed, no codes.
Pierce sent us on a wild goose chase.

262
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:52,874
Jeff was right. I am naive.

263
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,459
Oh, don't listen to him.

264
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:58,046
Nothing naive about helping a friend.
Jeff would know that if he wasn't...

265
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,423
- too cool for after-school specials.
- Thanks.

266
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:02,800
Don't worry. Abed's here.

267
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:06,387
I can feel him. Maybe we should
loop back to the indoor swing room.

268
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,932
Indoor swing? That's ridiculous.
Someone's gonna break a lamp.

269
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,976
Break something on it.

270
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:22,487
Britta, while I applaud your
gentle approach to psychoanalysis...

271
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,238
I'm not gonna talk about it.

272
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,575
Hey, cut it out!

273
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,328
You're gonna break the...

274
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,455
door.

275
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,972
- Well, look who came crawling back.
- Not crawling, walking.

276
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,517
Quite briskly. Follow.

277
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,269
I like talking to you, Annie. It's easy.

278
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,730
I hope you feel
like you can talk to me too.

279
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:01,150
- I...
- Spit it out.

280
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:02,610
No secrets between roomies.

281
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,404
- Behind you.
- I'm behind you too.

282
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,322
Hands. Wall!

283
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:09,617
Not sure where you're going here,
but just let it out.

284
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:13,371
Don't let it out!

285
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,664
Don't let it out!

286
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,637
All right, Pierce,
turn off your haunted house!

287
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:33,641
Oh, my God, Pierce is dead.

288
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:37,228
- Cornelius killed him.
- I broke the remote!

289
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,730
Do you think it's expensive?

290
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,735
Please, Pierce.

291
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,155
Please, don't die
slightly before your time.

292
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,907
This means we're next,
and I care about us.

293
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,417
Where...?

294
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,836
- Gotcha!
- What the hell?

295
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,255
I totally had you guys convinced
I was dead.

296
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:06,257
That'll teach you
to value my presence.

297
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:07,629
- Pierce.
- Don't Pierce me.

298
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:09,760
You were going to Vicki's party
without me.

299
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,263
Bet you didn't expect me
to fake a haunted house...

300
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:14,849
- to teach you a lesson.
- Exactly what we expected.

301
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:17,310
Pierce, Vicki's the one
that didn't invite you.

302
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:19,687
- Why didn't you scare her?
- Because I hate her.

303
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,564
Abed, where have you been?

304
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:23,608
I found Pierce's
secret surveillance room.

305
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,944
- He was faking a haunted house.
- Abed Nadir with the late report.

306
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,613
Sorry, good montages take time.

307
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:31,449
Man, it was so easy.

308
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:33,910
Some shadows,
a couple of mirror tricks.

309
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:38,915
A little custom-built latex walls and
you're all crapping in your short pants.

310
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:42,543
Pretty impressive, particularly the
figure you hired to watch you sleep.

311
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,296
- That is creepy.
- Standout performance. Is he SAG?

312
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:49,966
What are you doing?

313
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:51,552
I didn't hire anyone.

314
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,638
Enough, Pierce.
Just open the damn door.

315
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,806
- There's no ghost.
- How do you explain this?

316
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,935
You probably asked someone
to help you with your stupid prank...

317
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:00,478
and then forgot.

318
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,271
LeVar Burton was a hard no.

319
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:03,981
There's only one explanation.

320
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,317
I belittled my father's good name
for a prank.

321
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,945
And his ghost has returned
to scold me.

322
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:11,572
And probably butcher you guys
for going along with it.

323
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,242
You think hiding in this room
is gonna keep you safe?

324
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:17,995
Ghosts can't go through doors, stupid.
They're not fire.

325
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,248
Pierce, I am paying a teenager
by the hour...

326
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,084
to care about my children
so I can go to this party.

327
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:26,712
So you have to ask yourself,
is the real threat out there or in here?

328
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,172
Fine, I'll open it myself.

329
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,258
No, no. He'll scold me!

330
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:33,594
Someone's punching in the code.

331
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,013
Please, tell me one of us is outside.

332
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:46,357
- May I be of some assistance?
- Gilbert!

333
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:48,526
Gilbert, what are you doing
in my house?

334
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:50,278
Well, technically it's my house.

335
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,573
After our father died, I became
the sole inheritor of his estate...

336
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:56,534
including all six houses
and the decommissioned submarine.

337
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:57,826
- What?
- What?

338
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,620
So you came here to kick me out?

339
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:03,541
I came here to give you the deed, but
on the day of my arrival, you were out.

340
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,376
I noticed mail piled up by the door.

341
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:08,963
I took it in, paid the overdue bills,
replaced a few light bulbs...

342
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,507
and, well, that was six weeks ago.

343
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,926
You've been living here in secret
this whole time?

344
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:19,056
Yes, I'm ashamed to say that after
a lifetime as Cornelius's assistant...

345
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,934
I've had a difficult time
adjusting to his passing.

346
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:25,479
It seems his absence has taken a
greater toll than his presence ever did.

347
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,190
Taking care of Pierce
gave my life purpose again.

348
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:31,652
But now that I've been discovered
by your thin friend...

349
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,863
I must apologise
and bid you adieu.

350
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:35,531
Goodbye, Pierce.

351
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,786
There's a load of clean socks
in the dryer.

352
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:45,166
Gilbert, wait, wait. Look, I've been
doing really well since Dad died...

353
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,418
so I don't need anyone
taking care of me.

354
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,421
But if you're having a tough time...

355
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:52,757
well, I guess I could use
a roommate.

356
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,552
Will there be anything else,
brother?

357
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,429
Yes. Bring it in.

358
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,229
Have fun at the party.

359
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:10,232
Tell Vicki I say happy Halloween.
That'll mess with her.

360
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,943
- You don't wanna come?
- I've got a mask for you to wear.

361
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,446
- One that doesn't zip at the mouth.
- No, thanks.

362
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:19,408
I'll hang around here with Gilbert.
He needs me.

363
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,952
- Oh, that's nice.
- What was all that about masks?

364
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,372
- Don't know, don't want to.
- Fair enough.

365
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,082
Hey, how about you and I...

366
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:29,210
- skip out on this party?
- Why? To do what and where?

367
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:32,254
Oh, I was thinking you could show me
some Inspector Spacetime.

368
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:35,841
You're always talking about it.
I've never seen a full episode.

369
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,219
Sure you want to?
It starts pretty slow.

370
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,304
First inspector
couldn't even time-travel.

371
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:43,015
That sounds fine.
After a night of running in circles...

372
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:46,143
trying to untie Winger knots,
I'm looking for something slow.

373
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,484
Sorry I ruined your night.

374
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:56,654
Actually, Pierce ruined my night,
but you were right to let him.

375
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:58,155
Still wanna go to the party?

376
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:01,409
I heard Vicki bought dry ice
and gave Leonard the wrong address.

377
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:02,992
I'll take a pass.

378
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,830
I have some unfinished business
at home.

379
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,460
Troy.

380
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,379
Are you in here?

381
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,715
Abed, was that you?

382
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:01,594
I wanna show you something
on the other side of the bookcase.

383
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:03,971
Troy?

384
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,307
Find me as soon as you can.

385
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:10,603
Who is in my house?

386
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:12,353
Gilbert!

387
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:14,857
Hijinks.

388
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,236
Indubitably.

389
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:20,821
Did it work?

390
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,113
Are you tall?

390
00:21:23,305 --> 00:21:29,199
