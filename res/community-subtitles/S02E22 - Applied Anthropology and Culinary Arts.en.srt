00:06:21,895 --> 00:06:24,830
Oh, and you're gonna squat
in a babbling brook

162
00:06:24,898 --> 00:06:27,633
and a beautiful star child
is going to slide out

163
00:06:27,701 --> 00:06:29,835
on a ray of sunshine
while your cats each half watch

164
00:06:29,903 --> 00:06:31,270
because you're <i>so</i> natural.

165
00:06:31,338 --> 00:06:34,106
[Water breaks, students gasp]

166
00:06:34,174 --> 00:06:35,941
Oh-oh. Okay. Oh, boy.

167
00:06:35,992 --> 00:06:39,211
Can someone please get
every mop on campus?

168
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:42,348
Um, did you break water?
Is that broken water?

169
00:06:42,415 --> 00:06:44,783
- That's broken water!
- Chang baby!

170
00:06:46,893 --> 00:06:49,142
Just nice and easy, careful...

171
00:06:49,262 --> 00:06:51,643
Oh, father, God almighty,
this isn't happening.

172
00:06:51,727 --> 00:06:52,811
It's too soon.

173
00:06:52,895 --> 00:06:54,262
I don't want
my baby's first memory

174
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:57,499
- to be star-burns.
- Oh, goodness. All right.

175
00:06:57,567 --> 00:07:00,468
This is not a big deal. Wait.
I mean, it is a big deal.

176
00:07:00,536 --> 00:07:03,104
It's just not a big bad deal.
It's a big good deal.

177
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:04,506
If I could have everyone's
attention--

178
00:07:04,574 --> 00:07:06,641
Actually would like not
to have your attention.

179
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:08,293
Okay, give me your attention.

180
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:11,046
This student is having a baby.
What am I talking about?

181
00:07:11,113 --> 00:07:12,314
You already know.

182
00:07:12,381 --> 00:07:13,765
Okay, here's--
Okay, here's what it is.

183
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:14,949
I'm gonna go get my Prius,

184
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:16,518
I'm gonna pull around the back,

185
00:07:16,586 --> 00:07:18,119
and I'm gonna drive her
to the hospital.

186
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,788
I drive a Prius,
which I think is pretty cool.

187
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,291
- Dean, go!
- Okay, dean gone.

188
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,593
Can you please call Andre?

189
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:26,461
He's "Sugar Boots" in my phone.

190
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:27,929
That hurts, Shirley.

191
00:07:27,997 --> 00:07:31,333
Oh, oh, I'll get it
because I am here for you.

192
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,134
We came so close
to having one class

193
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:34,636
that wasn't all about them.

194
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,371
Remember when they all took
that fishing trip

195
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:37,572
on St. Patrick's Day?

196
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,973
God, that was a good week.

197
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:41,109
This has got
to be a Chang baby.

198
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,711
Changs are never born
in hospitals.

199
00:07:42,778 --> 00:07:45,780
More like taxicabs,
hardware stores,

200
00:07:45,831 --> 00:07:47,115
bank lines, sewers.

201
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,084
My nephew Jin
was born on a treadmill

202
00:07:49,151 --> 00:07:50,785
at bally total fitness.

203
00:07:50,836 --> 00:07:52,370
20% incline.

204
00:07:52,455 --> 00:07:54,856
"Sugar Boots" says that he'll
meet us at the hospital.

205
00:07:54,924 --> 00:07:58,009
Good. Now can somebody
do something about him?

206
00:07:58,094 --> 00:07:59,827
I'm just saying nobody needs
to freak out.

207
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,731
A Chang is hearty to the core.
We always come out healthy.

208
00:08:02,798 --> 00:08:04,182
That's why there's like
a billion of us.

209
00:08:04,267 --> 00:08:06,134
You ever tried googling me?
Can't be done!

210
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:08,570
Ben, you have to stop
freaking her out.

211
00:08:08,638 --> 00:08:09,771
Hey, show me some respect.

212
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:12,540
I might be that child's
estranged father.

213
00:08:12,608 --> 00:08:15,527
- Well, what's it gonna be?
- What?

214
00:08:15,611 --> 00:08:17,212
I want to buy the rights
to your handshake.

215
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,713
Do we have a deal?

216
00:08:18,781 --> 00:08:20,682
Pierce, we're about to take
Shirley to the hospital.

217
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:22,033
This is not the time.

218
00:08:22,118 --> 00:08:23,351
Oh, it's the time.

219
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:26,571
According to my watch,
it's 1,000 o'clock.

220
00:08:26,656 --> 00:08:28,156
- Deal.
- Deal.

221
00:08:28,224 --> 00:08:30,659
Great.

222
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:31,993
- So how does it work?
- I don't know.

223
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:33,094
We just kind of do it

224
00:08:33,162 --> 00:08:34,746
when one of us
says something awesome.

225
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:37,999
- Yeah.
- All right. Betty Grable.

226
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,921
I said Betty Grable.

227
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,074

228
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,051
- No.
- Yes.

229
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:01,055
- No.
- Do it.

230
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:05,694
Make your money, whore.
[Cries]

231
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,417
Who's Betty Grable?

232
00:09:12,501 --> 00:09:13,868
Yeah, that's the stuff.

233
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:16,738
[Cries]

234
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,740
Try to take deep breaths
and relax.

235
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,742
- Where is the dean?
- Oh, my God!

236
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:22,477
- Okay.
- Everything's wet!

237
00:09:22,545 --> 00:09:24,629
- Eew!
- Oh. Oh, that's okay.

238
00:09:24,714 --> 00:09:26,298
That's okay
because it is natural.

239
00:09:26,382 --> 00:09:29,050
It's natural.
[Inhales deeply]

240
00:09:29,118 --> 00:09:30,251
Are you uncomfortable, Britta?

241
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,287
- You wish.
- Oh!

242
00:09:32,355 --> 00:09:35,457
- Oh. Okay. Ooh.
- $400. $500.

243
00:09:35,524 --> 00:09:37,609
It's like a million bucks
in dog dollars.

244
00:09:37,693 --> 00:09:41,596
Word.

245
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:46,117
- What happened?
- Something's off.

246
00:09:46,202 --> 00:09:49,471
It's like buying candy
from a baby.

247
00:09:49,538 --> 00:09:51,206
What did you do?
You ruined it!

248
00:09:51,273 --> 00:09:52,624
Troy, give him back the money.

249
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:55,293
No, no, no.
Money doesn't matter anymore.

250
00:09:55,378 --> 00:09:58,163
Once you've sold something out,
you can't get it back.

251
00:09:58,247 --> 00:09:59,581
But you didn't even like
our handshake!

252
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,483
I hated it.
Now it's gone.

253
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:05,687
You two are dumber
than Jackie Coogan.

254
00:10:05,755 --> 00:10:09,691
He divorced Betty Grable.

255
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:11,426
Oh oh oh.

256
00:10:11,494 --> 00:10:13,345
Jeff, Pierce tainted
our special handshake

257
00:10:13,429 --> 00:10:14,496
with his blood money

258
00:10:14,563 --> 00:10:15,847
and now we can't get
the magic back!

259
00:10:15,931 --> 00:10:17,849
Holy crap.
You two for real?

260
00:10:17,933 --> 00:10:19,100
Both: Yeah.

261
00:10:19,168 --> 00:10:20,852
Nobody cares
about your stupid handshake.

262
00:10:20,936 --> 00:10:22,470
A baby is coming out
of Shirley's vagina

263
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:23,971
- two feet from us.
- Don't worry.

264
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:25,707
Her contractions are still
six minutes apart.

265
00:10:25,775 --> 00:10:27,842
So unless her cervix is dilated
more than eight centimeters,

266
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:31,946
we still have time
to get her to a hospital.

267
00:10:32,014 --> 00:10:33,248
I delivered a baby
earlier this year

268
00:10:33,315 --> 00:10:34,249
in the back of an SUV.

269
00:10:34,316 --> 00:10:35,350
- What?
- Hmm-hmm.

270
00:10:35,418 --> 00:10:36,451
Where was I when that happened?

271
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:39,537
I don't know.
Off in the background.

272
00:10:39,622 --> 00:10:41,823
- Did you pull your car up?
- Uh, <i>no.</i>

273
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,175
- It's been overturned!
- What?

274
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:47,045
Okay, look, I don't want
to alarm anyone,

275
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:50,331
but the world food festival
has taken a dark turn.

276
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:52,734
I guess some national
ethnicities

277
00:10:52,802 --> 00:10:54,185
don't play nice with others

278
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:58,022
and things have turned
into a bit of a race...

279
00:10:58,107 --> 00:11:00,175
- Kerfuffle.
- You mean riot?

280
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:04,362
Uh, let's use kerfuffle
for now, okay, Mr. Winger?

281
00:11:04,447 --> 00:11:08,516
I was just trying
to feed hungry foodies.

282
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:09,901
I'm going to call an ambulance.

283
00:11:09,985 --> 00:11:11,403
Oh, there's ambulances
out there!

284
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,221
They're overturning those too!

285
00:11:13,289 --> 00:11:16,241
I mean, I didn't even know
there was a difference

286
00:11:16,325 --> 00:11:18,576
between North
and South Korean barbeque.

287
00:11:18,661 --> 00:11:21,096
I mean, <i>M*A*S*H</i> lasted longer
than that war.

288
00:11:21,163 --> 00:11:24,099
Get over it. Am I right?
Don't print that.

289
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:27,368
Let's just quit jotting.
Stop writing!

290
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,370
Okay, 911 says it's gonna take
over an hour

291
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,072
because of a race kerfuffle.

292
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,259
Oh.
Lake Woebegone. Eeh!

293
00:11:34,343 --> 00:11:36,177
Abed, what do we do?

294
00:11:36,245 --> 00:11:37,545
Shirley,
pretend I'm saying this

295
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:40,014
in a soothing, reassuring,
non-robotic voice.

296
00:11:40,065 --> 00:11:41,516
We're not going to make it
to the hospital.

297
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:42,750
Yes, I am.

298
00:11:42,818 --> 00:11:44,152
I'm going to have this baby
in a hospital

299
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,553
with my husband and the father
of my baby.

300
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:46,654
Unless that father is me.

301
00:11:46,722 --> 00:11:48,723
In which case,
what you need to do now

302
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:50,158
is elevate your legs
over your head

303
00:11:50,225 --> 00:11:53,060
while facing the northeast
corner of the room.

304
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,913
But try not to look
at the door, okay?

305
00:11:54,997 --> 00:11:57,198
That's bad luck and Chang babies
are very superstitious.

306
00:11:57,249 --> 00:12:01,202
Also if you can visualize
a rabbit riding a dragon,

307
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,271
it'll increase his chances
of winning lotteries.

308
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:05,907
- [Winces]
- Ben, corner.

309
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:10,178
Listen, Shirley, we're having
the baby right here, right now.

310
00:12:10,245 --> 00:12:12,680
- [Whimpers] Okay.
- Okay.

311
00:12:12,748 --> 00:12:14,415
Troy, get every blanket
and coat you can find.

312
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:15,750
Anything soft for Shirley
to lie on.

313
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:16,851
Annie, I need you to call Andre

314
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:18,252
and tell him
to meet us here instead.

315
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:20,255

00:18:20,451 --> 00:18:21,685
This has been quite a day.

474
00:18:21,753 --> 00:18:23,387
You can expect a cover story
in the next issue.

475
00:18:23,454 --> 00:18:25,455
In a good way?

476
00:18:25,523 --> 00:18:29,726
Like an article
about what a good dean I am?

477
00:18:29,777 --> 00:18:33,330
- Absolutely.
- [Exhales]

478
00:18:33,398 --> 00:18:36,500
I did it.

479
00:18:36,567 --> 00:18:41,505
I did it.
I am a good dean.

480
00:18:41,572 --> 00:18:47,344
I am a good dean!
[Laughs] Whoo!

481
00:18:56,263 --> 00:18:57,793
Are you sure you want
to do this?

482
00:18:58,199 --> 00:18:59,632
I know people do it in movies
all the time,

483
00:18:59,688 --> 00:19:01,452
but there are bound to be
real world consequences.

484
00:19:01,453 --> 00:19:02,786
I know, but if we take
that test today,

485
00:19:02,854 --> 00:19:05,622
we are definitely going
to fail it.

486
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:10,160
Okay, let's do it.

487
00:19:21,506 --> 00:19:22,823
What are you guys doing?

488
00:19:28,163 --> 00:19:30,597
Cancel school today
or we tell everybody about this.

489
00:19:30,665 --> 00:19:32,816
Deal.

490
00:19:33,016 --> 00:19:43,216
