1
00:00:01,324 --> 00:00:05,262
"Always scare Daniel-san,
Miyagi hate fighting."

2
00:00:06,125 --> 00:00:08,125
"Miyagi hate fighting."

3
00:00:08,612 --> 00:00:10,426
- Line?
- "Yeah, but you like karate."

4
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:13,137
Right, right, yeah, but,
y... you like karate though.

5
00:00:13,157 --> 00:00:14,439
So?

6
00:00:15,253 --> 00:00:18,612
- Line.
- Chang, the audition's at 3.00.

7
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,341
Maybe I shouldn't go, you
know, maybe I'm a bad actor.

8
00:00:21,347 --> 00:00:23,486
Being good is
a fraction of acting.

9
00:00:23,512 --> 00:00:26,338
It takes discipline
and confidence.

10
00:00:26,352 --> 00:00:30,178
Discipline, confidence.
Okay from the top.

11
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:33,341
"Always scare Daniel-san.
Miyagi hate fighting."

12
00:00:33,354 --> 00:00:34,889
Line.

13
00:00:34,902 --> 00:00:36,009
I heard Karate Kid quotes.

14
00:00:36,015 --> 00:00:40,000
Chang is auditioning for the stage
adaptation of Karate Kid downtown.

15
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:42,850
Yeah, and it's for the
part of Daniel LaRusso.

16
00:00:42,857 --> 00:00:46,380
- You got a problem with that, racist?
- No, you're acting now?

17
00:00:46,386 --> 00:00:48,773
Yeah, you got
a problem with that?

18
00:00:48,783 --> 00:00:50,264
I'm clear.

19
00:00:50,277 --> 00:00:52,713
They took my snake, and they
turned it into a plumber.

20
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,578
They made the eggs,
into barrels.

21
00:00:54,591 --> 00:00:57,658
The pine tree they made into a
gorilla, but I recognized my design.

22
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,424
Donkey Kong my ass.

23
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,527
That's construction snake.

24
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,100
- I don't practice law anymore.
- But, we have a case, right?

25
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:08,111
- Isn't everyone you'd be suing dead?
- That's not cool, man.

26
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:11,849
- Why would a tree throw eggs at a snake?
- Why would a plumber be fighting a monkey?

27
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,405
I don't know, I don't know.

28
00:01:13,828 --> 00:01:15,328
The Wi-Fi's still broken.

29
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,944
- What happened to good morning?
- It's a bad morning, no Wi-Fi.

30
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,295
Yeah, we really
need Wi-Fi.

31
00:01:19,308 --> 00:01:22,355
Okay, let's not get carried
away. We need oxygen.

32
00:01:22,361 --> 00:01:25,498
We have oxygen,
we need Wi-Fi.

33
00:01:25,513 --> 00:01:29,043
Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi.

34
00:01:29,061 --> 00:01:31,362
Okay, enough, right?

35
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:33,668
Look what I'm doing, look.

36
00:01:33,682 --> 00:01:36,765
Fix, Wi-Fi.

37
00:01:36,771 --> 00:01:40,179
Mm-hm, okay,
boom and boom.

38
00:01:40,185 --> 00:01:43,908
All right. I, I'm trying
to find the IT lady.

39
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,551
My emails to her get bounced back
to me in Aramaic, and when I call,

40
00:01:47,563 --> 00:01:50,661
I hear an undulating high-pitched
whistle that makes my nose bleed.

41
00:01:50,667 --> 00:01:53,388
Well, sounds like
a bad IT lady, right?

42
00:01:53,394 --> 00:01:56,121
- Frankie, hire a new IT lady.
- I'm pretty handy with technology.

43
00:01:56,127 --> 00:01:59,040
I'm assuming it's still the same,
smaller holes, more bytes.

44
00:01:59,054 --> 00:02:01,251
- Now what are we up to now, mega?
- Tera.

45
00:02:01,902 --> 00:02:03,269
Tera.

46
00:02:04,572 --> 00:02:06,846
They did it, those bastards.
They finally did it.

47
00:02:06,856 --> 00:02:09,157
Frankie, hire Elroy.
Elroy, you're the IT lady.

48
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:10,865
- Can I be his assistant?
- Not for money.

49
00:02:10,877 --> 00:02:13,129
- Can I be his friend?
- Elroy, Abed is your friend.

50
00:02:13,143 --> 00:02:17,554
Now the real reason
I came by, I'm dying.

51
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:24,007
Not really, but imagine how bad you
feel for complaining about the Wi-Fi.

52
00:02:24,016 --> 00:02:26,502
Here's the real reason.

53
00:02:26,526 --> 00:02:27,966
Too short?

54
00:02:29,222 --> 00:02:30,758
It is too short?

55
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,843
It's not too short? You
people are no help.

57
00:03:07,675 --> 00:03:10,050
School board come in.

58
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:11,917
School board,
you're surrounded.

59
00:03:11,929 --> 00:03:14,753
If this is about the bonfire, we'll
put it out when the weather breaks.

60
00:03:14,766 --> 00:03:16,586
We come in peace.

61
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:19,967
We've had our ups and downs,
but as of right now.

62
00:03:19,981 --> 00:03:23,090
We love this school, and love
what you're doing with it.

63
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:25,789
What? Why?

64
00:03:25,802 --> 00:03:27,483
What would you think
about moving up?

65
00:03:27,485 --> 00:03:29,299
- Well.
- Joining us on the board?

66
00:03:29,311 --> 00:03:32,230
Me? I would love to be
on the school board.

67
00:03:32,243 --> 00:03:33,944
- Awesome.
- Awesome.

68
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,530
One, one more thing.

69
00:03:35,555 --> 00:03:37,314
You're

70
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,979
gay, right?

71
00:03:38,992 --> 00:03:42,259
I mean, like openly gay.

72
00:03:42,272 --> 00:03:46,396
Ah, I'm not openly anything, and
gay doesn't begin to cover it.

73
00:03:46,415 --> 00:03:48,460
No, no.

74
00:03:49,243 --> 00:03:50,906
Oh, I get it.

75
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:54,278
This is about the uproar over you
guys cancelling the pride parade,

76
00:03:54,292 --> 00:03:55,625
for a school board parade.

77
00:03:55,638 --> 00:03:58,372
Those guys get to dress
fancy all year.

78
00:03:58,377 --> 00:03:59,444
- No, no.
- We have one day!

79
00:03:59,451 --> 00:04:01,598
No, this isn't about that.

80
00:04:01,604 --> 00:04:04,913
This is about adding
a new face to the board.

81
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:07,614
But, if that new face
happened to be openly gay,

82
00:04:07,621 --> 00:04:10,217
it would be because
we're so tolerant.

83
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:11,503
And always were.

84
00:04:11,528 --> 00:04:14,149
But, that's for
us to deal with.

85
00:04:14,162 --> 00:04:18,206
The question you have to
ask is, am I openly gay?

86
00:04:18,218 --> 00:04:21,475
Because, if you are that
gayness could be a rocket,

87
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:23,481
thrusting you
to new gay heights.

88
00:04:23,495 --> 00:04:28,315
And if you're not. Well, there's
a lot of gay guys out there.

89
00:04:29,122 --> 00:04:32,329
I assume that's the selling
point of the lifestyle.

90
00:04:32,341 --> 00:04:34,175
You know, I, I, I never
thought about it that way.

91
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:38,702
Well, I have. Cutting women
out of sex, it's genius.

92
00:04:40,396 --> 00:04:45,608
Gay Dean. Gay Dean.
Gay Dean. Gay Dean.

93
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:51,360
I'm begging you to be a gay
dean of the school board.

94
00:04:55,906 --> 00:04:57,877
This should lead
to the router.

95
00:05:04,831 --> 00:05:06,574
Back up, back up, back up,
back up, back up, back back.

96
00:05:06,586 --> 00:05:07,867
Wh-Wh-What's going on?

97
00:05:07,872 --> 00:05:09,841
There's a birds nest in
there, with babies in it.

98
00:05:09,846 --> 00:05:11,593
The mother must have built
it there because of the heat.

99
00:05:11,598 --> 00:05:13,254
Same reason my mom took
my half brother to Arizona.

100
00:05:13,266 --> 00:05:15,918
That's probably why the Wi-Fi's
down, we'll have to move it.

101
00:05:15,925 --> 00:05:17,774
If you move them the mother
won't come back.

102
00:05:18,507 --> 00:05:21,288
Those birds aren't
the new IT lady, I am.

103
00:05:21,312 --> 00:05:22,745
I'll move it carefully.

104
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:24,519
The mother won't
come back.

105
00:05:25,382 --> 00:05:26,935
Kid,

106
00:05:26,946 --> 00:05:29,523
animals have been murdering each
other for 3 billion years.

107
00:05:29,536 --> 00:05:31,668
Birds have had their 15
million in the spotlight.

108
00:05:31,675 --> 00:05:33,326
The same as lizards
and plants

109
00:05:33,351 --> 00:05:37,514
and they all just use it to murder,
eat, screw and not invent Wi-Fi.

110
00:05:37,526 --> 00:05:39,483
Now we may end up
saving this world,

111
00:05:39,507 --> 00:05:41,420
or blowing it to hell
or making a new one.

112
00:05:41,427 --> 00:05:43,988
But we can't do any of it while
scheduling our evolution

113
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,641
around the needs of
the least lucky birds.

114
00:05:49,106 --> 00:05:51,170
What are you, a demon?
Did Clive Barker write you?

115
00:05:51,177 --> 00:05:54,074
Anyone who finds that nest,
will come to the same decision.

116
00:05:54,648 --> 00:05:56,398
And you don't
have to get mean.

117
00:05:57,132 --> 00:05:58,173
Mean?

118
00:05:58,197 --> 00:06:00,831
You just did a baby
bird murder monologue.

119
00:06:00,843 --> 00:06:02,088
Maybe they're close
to leaving the nest,

120
00:06:02,093 --> 00:06:04,641
until then can't you just stall
by doing what real IT people do?

121
00:06:04,646 --> 00:06:06,545
- What's that?
- Exactly.

122
00:06:09,353 --> 00:06:11,730
I've got one year
to make it all work,

123
00:06:11,755 --> 00:06:15,182
and that's what I'm gonna do,
make it work, all of it.

124
00:06:15,201 --> 00:06:17,237
This place is intimidating.

125
00:06:17,262 --> 00:06:18,776
You're gonna do great.

126
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:22,478
Next up, Ben Chang, for
the role of Daniel LaRusso.

127
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,766
Thank you.

128
00:06:27,774 --> 00:06:30,314
Daniel-san, why you
want learn karate?

129
00:06:30,327 --> 00:06:31,115
Hang on a second.

130
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,882
- Sorry, I can do better.
- Zip it.

131
00:06:33,422 --> 00:06:34,935
Who are you?

132
00:06:34,941 --> 00:06:37,101
Oh, I'm Annie,
a friend of Chang's.

133
00:06:37,115 --> 00:06:39,425
You mind coming up here and
reading with your friend?

134
00:06:41,593 --> 00:06:44,033
Okay, if it helps.

135
00:06:52,884 --> 00:06:56,790
- "Daniel-san, what you want?"
- Okay, no, sorry, no.

136
00:06:56,803 --> 00:06:59,428
You read Daniel-san.
You read Miyagi.

137
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:03,721
We'll do scene seven,
Miyagi's office.

138
00:07:15,225 --> 00:07:17,949
- Are you the repairman?
- Aye.

139
00:07:17,961 --> 00:07:21,154
- The faucet's really leaky there.
- Aye.

140
00:07:21,173 --> 00:07:23,086
When you gonna fix it?

141
00:07:23,778 --> 00:07:25,252
After.

142
00:07:25,266 --> 00:07:27,178
After what?

143
00:07:27,831 --> 00:07:29,497
After after.

144
00:07:30,093 --> 00:07:32,180
Tell everyone
else to go home.

145
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:35,523
- We got the parts!
- Hear, hear.

146
00:07:35,528 --> 00:07:36,523
Parts plural?

147
00:07:36,528 --> 00:07:40,134
Well yeah, Annie got my part
and I got the Asian part.

148
00:07:40,148 --> 00:07:42,127
Chang... Stop!

149
00:07:42,141 --> 00:07:45,659
We were cast as Mr. Miyagi
and the Karate Kid,

150
00:07:45,677 --> 00:07:47,215
because we're a good team!

151
00:07:47,221 --> 00:07:49,567
We're a team, because
one of us is so talented

152
00:07:49,571 --> 00:07:52,840
she got cast outside her
gender and the other one,

153
00:07:52,845 --> 00:07:54,612
got cast because
of eye shape.

154
00:07:54,617 --> 00:07:58,115
I am not letting you
sabotage yourself like this.

155
00:07:58,122 --> 00:07:59,302
Let's say you're right.

156
00:07:59,316 --> 00:08:04,505
And like Sidney Poitier or Meg Ryan
before you, you were cast for race.

157
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:08,755
It's what the actor does with
the role they get, that matters.

158
00:08:08,764 --> 00:08:10,961
- All right?
- You're right.

159
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:14,475
All right, IT lady.
How goes it?

160
00:08:14,483 --> 00:08:16,562
- I found your problem.
- And?

161
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,925
I'll need a little time to fix it.

162
00:08:21,937 --> 00:08:24,168
Wow, need time to fix it?

163
00:08:24,187 --> 00:08:26,300
You sound just like
you work in IT.

164
00:08:26,307 --> 00:08:27,874
I've got some
interesting news,

165
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:30,351
the school board,
offered me a position.

166
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:32,389
- Ooh.
- Great.

167
00:08:32,403 --> 00:08:33,336
Cool.

168
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:36,663
Well I got a part in a play and
we were sort of talking about that,

169
00:08:36,677 --> 00:08:38,977
so read the room Pelton.

170
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,008
Are you gonna
take the job?

171
00:08:41,024 --> 00:08:44,886
I don't know,
there's a catch.

172
00:08:45,467 --> 00:08:48,316
Jeffrey, Frankie, could I see
you in my office please?

173
00:08:49,448 --> 00:08:52,293
They want you to be
a token homosexual?

174
00:08:52,307 --> 00:08:55,115
It's a form of progress,
30 years ago,

175
00:08:55,126 --> 00:08:58,220
the most power an openly gay could
achieve was a center square.

176
00:08:58,225 --> 00:09:01,539
- But I'm not just gay.
- What does that mean?

177
00:09:01,552 --> 00:09:04,024
If coming out is
a magic show,

178
00:09:04,048 --> 00:09:05,984
and gayness is the rabbit
out of the hat,

179
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:09,061
I'm one of those
never-ending handkerchiefs.

180
00:09:10,169 --> 00:09:11,979
The sad truth, Craig?

181
00:09:12,004 --> 00:09:16,033
Anything other than straight,
is plenty gay for a school board.

182
00:09:16,038 --> 00:09:20,524
The most important point is, are you
prepared to make your sexuality,

183
00:09:20,538 --> 00:09:22,554
which is nobody's business,

184
00:09:22,572 --> 00:09:26,173
an aspect of your
role in society?

185
00:09:26,186 --> 00:09:28,386
I know I'm not, so I don't.

186
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,893
No?

187
00:09:29,905 --> 00:09:33,625
When a person becomes symbolic
they gain symbolic power,

188
00:09:33,631 --> 00:09:36,518
at the price of
independent power.

189
00:09:36,524 --> 00:09:38,263
Yep. That's an excellent point.

190
00:09:38,775 --> 00:09:42,888
It could be good for Greendale, for one
of our own to be on the school board.

191
00:09:42,908 --> 00:09:44,520
I mean the fact that
you'd be leaving a few items

192
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:46,793
off your list of your
turn-ons, I mean,

193
00:09:46,798 --> 00:09:51,025
the goal in politics, isn't
transparency, it's winning.

194
00:09:51,033 --> 00:09:54,566
- That's why the politicians always win.
- They do always win, don't they?

195
00:09:54,572 --> 00:09:59,090
But now I get a chance to win. I could
change the system from the inside out.

196
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:03,198
And all I have to do is pare down
my sexuality to simple gayness,

197
00:10:03,205 --> 00:10:06,591
- which is heavily in the mix.
- There you go.

198
00:10:07,644 --> 00:10:09,224
Get ready, America.

199
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:14,581
Dean Pelton is coming out as approximately
two-sevenths of what he is.

200
00:10:16,942 --> 00:10:19,489
Come on. Don't
leave me hanging.

201
00:10:20,201 --> 00:10:21,710
There we go.

202
00:10:24,566 --> 00:10:25,860
I am so curious.

203
00:10:25,871 --> 00:10:27,697
- Oh.
- Intellectually.

204
00:10:28,511 --> 00:10:29,591
All right.

205
00:10:29,616 --> 00:10:31,163
This is a pretty
basic scene.

206
00:10:31,169 --> 00:10:33,855
No real subtext. Let's just
get it up on its feet.

207
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:37,346
There's no wrong answers.
Okay? Great. Go.

208
00:10:43,584 --> 00:10:46,171
Hey, come fix faucet.

209
00:10:50,404 --> 00:10:53,702
Oh, Karate, learn
from book?

210
00:10:53,716 --> 00:10:58,461
Yeah. And a few classes back at
the Y in Jersey where I'm from.

211
00:10:58,474 --> 00:11:00,028
What happened I?

212
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:04,172
Okay, I'm gonna stop you right there.
I guess there are wrong answers.

213
00:11:04,184 --> 00:11:05,245
Quick adjustment, Ben.

214
00:11:05,258 --> 00:11:08,130
- Yeah?
- Act better. Act better.

215
00:11:08,144 --> 00:11:11,065
Thanks. Annie, you're doing great.
Keep doing what you're doing.

216
00:11:11,077 --> 00:11:11,817
Oh.

217
00:11:11,823 --> 00:11:15,118
- Can I ask about by motiv...
- Keep me from puking is your motivation.

218
00:11:15,124 --> 00:11:17,732
Stop making me want to quit
the theater and kill myself.

219
00:11:17,739 --> 00:11:20,308
Go. After "What happened I."

220
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:22,284
Oh. Okay.

221
00:11:22,886 --> 00:11:25,267
Hey. I fell off my bike.

222
00:11:25,287 --> 00:11:28,067
Hm. Lucky no hurt hand.

223
00:11:28,073 --> 00:11:29,640
Okay.

224
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,298
Can I see this tool box?

225
00:11:33,716 --> 00:11:35,841
Great. This is good. Got it.

226
00:11:37,999 --> 00:11:43,245
I got distracted cuz the tools
were doing a better job than you.

227
00:11:43,264 --> 00:11:45,956
What happened I? Say it.

228
00:11:45,967 --> 00:11:47,105
What happened I.

229
00:11:47,116 --> 00:11:50,292
Liar. Stop lying to me.
Say it.

230
00:11:50,304 --> 00:11:53,802
- What happened I.
- What happened actor?

231
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:55,879
You crying?

232
00:11:56,345 --> 00:11:58,106
You cry when
I tell you to cry.

233
00:11:58,524 --> 00:12:03,187
So reabsorb that disgusting droplet of salt
and bad choices back into your doughy body.

234
00:12:03,207 --> 00:12:05,592
And then call your mother
to see if you can be reabsorbed

235
00:12:05,618 --> 00:12:07,645
back into her doughy
body or so help me God,

236
00:12:07,671 --> 00:12:11,177
I will take that tear, I will freeze it,
and I will stab you in the eye with it,

237
00:12:11,191 --> 00:12:14,547
you waste of a soul-shaped
hole forgotten by God.

238
00:12:16,672 --> 00:12:18,048
Okay.

239
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:18,952
What should I...

240
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:22,056
Annie, don't change a thing, you're
perfect. Unless you want to.

241
00:12:22,562 --> 00:12:24,047
Okay.

242
00:12:28,871 --> 00:12:34,428
All right I'm Rich Countee, this is my
man Carl. We work on the school board.

243
00:12:34,442 --> 00:12:36,813
- Yeah, we do.
- We have some exciting news for you.

244
00:12:36,832 --> 00:12:39,491
Your own dean,
Craig Pelton,

245
00:12:39,517 --> 00:12:43,683
has been selected to join the board
of Colorado Community Colleges,

246
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:45,601
and I'll just, go,
go ahead Dean.

247
00:12:45,615 --> 00:12:47,062
Guys. Talk.

248
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:49,568
Okay. Hello Greendale.

249
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:54,635
As you know, this is something
I wanted for a very long time

250
00:12:54,642 --> 00:12:56,975
and I wanted to thank all
of the people at Greendale

251
00:12:56,981 --> 00:13:02,424
that helped me achieve this
and my partner, Domingo.

252
00:13:02,437 --> 00:13:07,214
- Very proud of my Craig.
- Oh, that's, but, oh, oh.

253
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,659
And now let's open it
up to some questions.

254
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:10,500
- Dean.
- Dean.

255
00:13:10,505 --> 00:13:13,844
As a gay dean, what is your opinion
about the recent controversy

256
00:13:13,869 --> 00:13:15,889
surrounding the cancelled
Pride Parade,

257
00:13:15,913 --> 00:13:17,979
and do you think you were
selected to join the board

258
00:13:18,004 --> 00:13:20,345
- because of your sexual preference?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

259
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:24,494
I would just like to say that we are very
proud to have Mr. Pelton on the board,

260
00:13:24,508 --> 00:13:26,400
whatever his
lifestyle may be.

261
00:13:26,413 --> 00:13:28,476
Which happens to be gay!

262
00:13:28,486 --> 00:13:31,076
Which is great,
but irrelevant!

263
00:13:31,654 --> 00:13:34,068
Hey, it gets better!

264
00:13:37,965 --> 00:13:41,259
Oh good. We're so happy.

265
00:13:41,267 --> 00:13:43,274
- I feel like scum.
- Gay people are scum?

266
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,918
Hey, don't play that
card with me young man.

267
00:13:44,923 --> 00:13:46,850
I make gayness look
like Mormonism.

268
00:13:46,864 --> 00:13:48,411
I don't like being
this dishonest.

269
00:13:48,423 --> 00:13:51,077
Dean, I want to say
thanks for doing this.

270
00:13:51,084 --> 00:13:53,671
I never knew. I mean,
people talked, but...

271
00:13:53,677 --> 00:13:56,381
Sure, well, it really doesn't
have anything to do with my work.

272
00:13:56,388 --> 00:14:01,110
Yeah, but it's helpful, to me.
You know, and to a lot of us, so.

273
00:14:01,124 --> 00:14:02,602
Thank you.

274
00:14:06,578 --> 00:14:07,831
Hm.

275
00:14:09,111 --> 00:14:11,480
Confine yourself
to your role, Domingo.

276
00:14:12,789 --> 00:14:13,884
And lose the attitude.

Oh, Daniel-san,
you much-a humor.

284
00:14:44,773 --> 00:14:47,111
Hm, okay.
Let's stop there.

285
00:14:55,306 --> 00:14:59,067
I'm not gonna hit you. And
it's not because it's illegal,

286
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,514
and it's certainly not because
I'm afraid you know karate

287
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:05,043
because there is nothing about
your performance that is believable.

288
00:15:05,048 --> 00:15:08,970
See, we only hit things,
that effect us.

289
00:15:08,981 --> 00:15:11,620
I don't hit water,
or old mayonnaise.

290
00:15:11,636 --> 00:15:14,157
Or the air after
a fart has dissipated.

291
00:15:14,169 --> 00:15:17,216
And I'm not hitting you.

292
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:19,743
You are the worst actor
I've ever directed

293
00:15:19,755 --> 00:15:22,288
and I've directed
both Wahlbergs!

294
00:15:22,749 --> 00:15:23,942
From the top!

295
00:15:23,947 --> 00:15:27,121
Danny does a bit with the floor
sanders, Miyagi is amused,

296
00:15:27,128 --> 00:15:31,284
and Kenny gets me another god damned
cup of coffee with six Splendas in it!

297
00:15:35,147 --> 00:15:37,268
Hare Krishna.

298
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,301
He's so mean to Chang.
I don't know what to do.

299
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:43,707
You could just drop
out of the play.

300
00:15:43,732 --> 00:15:48,446
Well, you know I could.
Or Chang could.

301
00:15:48,452 --> 00:15:50,975
I mean, the director is
not being mean to me.

302
00:15:50,981 --> 00:15:52,841
But you talked Chang
into auditioning

303
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:55,738
and then you got his part
and now he's suffering.

304
00:15:56,721 --> 00:16:00,100
- You're right, I should threaten to quit.
- Or just quit.

305
00:16:00,115 --> 00:16:04,292
Well, if I threaten to quit maybe that will
be enough for him to stop abusing Chang.

306
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:08,201
I was kind of born
to act, Britta.

307
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:12,538
When I do it, I can feel
it pleasing the universe.

308
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:17,519
- That's dramatic.
- See?

309
00:16:24,196 --> 00:16:26,734
The internet says that if they're sparrows
they'll be flying in less than 12 days.

310
00:16:26,746 --> 00:16:29,120
If they're albatrosses,
we're in trouble.

311
00:16:31,393 --> 00:16:34,168
Albatrosses have a 270
day fledgling period.

312
00:16:41,044 --> 00:16:43,009
Thanks for guarding
the nest with me.

313
00:16:45,691 --> 00:16:46,518
Uh-oh.

314
00:16:46,524 --> 00:16:49,097
This is what you do
when you're working?

315
00:16:49,629 --> 00:16:50,730
Must be nice.

316
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:53,423
All right, look. There's a
bird's nest in the router.

317
00:16:53,442 --> 00:16:55,202
Now if you want
to fire me, fire me.

318
00:16:55,216 --> 00:16:59,934
Either way, until those birds are
gone nobody gets any closer.

319
00:17:01,009 --> 00:17:02,277
Well of course not.

320
00:17:02,301 --> 00:17:04,567
If you move them the mother
won't come back.

321
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:06,146
Keep up the good work.

322
00:17:12,744 --> 00:17:14,990
Show me wax on.

323
00:17:14,998 --> 00:17:17,436
This is the worst acting
I've ever seen in my life.

324
00:17:18,935 --> 00:17:21,430
Show me wax, off.

325
00:17:21,442 --> 00:17:24,576
The ghost of your father
just turned his back on you.

326
00:17:24,588 --> 00:17:27,276
Your ancestors are
clawing their way

327
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,673
deeper into the Earth
to get away from you,

328
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,964
you make me embarrassed
to have thumbs,

329
00:17:31,977 --> 00:17:34,022
I can see air
quotes around you.

330
00:17:34,036 --> 00:17:37,397
Show me, paint fence.

331
00:17:37,403 --> 00:17:38,852
Knock, knock, knock,
anybody home?

332
00:17:38,864 --> 00:17:40,968
Oh look, there's nobody
here, oh it's so dusty,

333
00:17:40,973 --> 00:17:42,980
it's almost like nobody's
been here in years.

334
00:17:42,993 --> 00:17:44,424
There's a note.

335
00:17:45,846 --> 00:17:47,567
"Never let me act."

336
00:17:47,579 --> 00:17:51,590
Mr. Lundergard, I'm sorry, but I
cannot stand by while you do this.

337
00:17:51,596 --> 00:17:53,423
That's fine, you can go.

338
00:17:54,329 --> 00:17:55,843
I'm not bluffing.

339
00:17:55,848 --> 00:17:58,791
You can't make an actor more
talented by yelling at them.

340
00:17:58,805 --> 00:18:02,424
And if you don't stop, your lead
character is going to walk.

341
00:18:03,098 --> 00:18:04,378
Lead?

342
00:18:05,044 --> 00:18:06,691
You play Danny LaRusso.

343
00:18:07,098 --> 00:18:09,138
Well I'm the Karate Kid.

344
00:18:09,144 --> 00:18:12,661
The Karate Kid is
about Kesuke Miyagi,

345
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:15,660
an immigrant who fought against
his own people in World War II,

346
00:18:15,673 --> 00:18:19,009
while his wife lost a child
in an internment camp.

347
00:18:19,022 --> 00:18:22,948
Noriyuki Morita was nominated for
an Academy Award for his performance.

348
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,979
Ralph Macchio? Showed up.

349
00:18:25,991 --> 00:18:30,270
I cast you because your measurements allow
me to use the same wardrobe as last year.

350
00:18:30,296 --> 00:18:32,864
I cast Ben because
he has the sadness

351
00:18:32,888 --> 00:18:35,455
and talent that could
make this show great.

352
00:18:35,468 --> 00:18:38,969
If I have to physically
drill into his chest

353
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:41,861
and suck it out
with a straw!

354
00:18:41,874 --> 00:18:44,067
So you can take
a flying kick

355
00:18:44,092 --> 00:18:46,459
and a rolling donut!
You're fired.

356
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:49,529
But I'm talented,
too, right?

357
00:18:49,542 --> 00:18:52,690
What? No. Really? Really?

358
00:18:52,697 --> 00:18:56,069
Oh my God! You're like doing a
terrible Vinnie Barbarino up here.

359
00:18:56,084 --> 00:18:58,394
But, like, I know you're not
capable of anything better,

360
00:18:58,401 --> 00:19:00,906
so, that's why I've been
so nice to you.

361
00:19:00,913 --> 00:19:02,179
Take care Annie.

362
00:19:03,221 --> 00:19:04,635
Yikes, right?

363
00:19:05,247 --> 00:19:06,556
What a diva.

364
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:13,068
- Thanks for sticking up for me.
- No problem?

365
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:17,382
From now on,
she's dead to us.

366
00:19:18,349 --> 00:19:20,727
Hey gay Dean, we got
a problem here.

367
00:19:20,751 --> 00:19:22,092
You ring the local papers?

368
00:19:22,098 --> 00:19:27,073
You've shut down the campus Wi-Fi
until a nest of baby birds can grow?

369
00:19:27,086 --> 00:19:28,487
That's a little too gay.

370
00:19:28,499 --> 00:19:31,212
I didn't do it because I'm gay.
Wait, I'm not gay.

371
00:19:31,226 --> 00:19:33,506
Oh, that did not
just get said to us.

372
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:35,849
You are gay. You are
openly gay and we love it.

373
00:19:35,869 --> 00:19:38,442
But now we are dealing with
more flak from conservatives

374
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:42,214
for appointing you than we ever did
from gays for not having one of you.

375
00:19:42,221 --> 00:19:44,580
Yeah, and the gays aren't
coming to your side.

376
00:19:44,586 --> 00:19:48,040
You know why? Because the whole
point is to get a job by being gay

377
00:19:48,046 --> 00:19:50,347
and then to do as good
of job as the normals.

378
00:19:50,361 --> 00:19:52,021
That's what the gays want.

379
00:19:52,034 --> 00:19:55,470
They don't want a gay dean who
acts like a weird gay monster.

380
00:19:55,476 --> 00:19:58,729
- I'm not a gay dean.
- Whoa, not cool, man.

381
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,693
Don't bring us into
your web of lies.

382
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:02,310
Well,

383
00:20:02,325 --> 00:20:07,539
- now what do you want me to do?
- Figure it out, gay dean. Figure it out.

384
00:20:10,003 --> 00:20:12,478
- Hey, Domingo.
- Hey, what's up?

385
00:20:15,836 --> 00:20:19,548
Guys, the school needs Wi-Fi,
and my job is to run the school.

386
00:20:19,554 --> 00:20:21,688
The school doesn't
need baby birds.

387
00:20:21,701 --> 00:20:25,255
- The nest needs to be moved.
- You are not crossing this line.

388
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,604
- I'm taping this. This is on video.
- Guys...

389
00:20:28,623 --> 00:20:34,291
This is two white security guards versus
one unarmed black man and two baby birds.

390
00:20:34,736 --> 00:20:35,868
Your move.

391
00:20:36,592 --> 00:20:38,632
Stand down. Stand down.

392
00:20:38,644 --> 00:20:40,773
No security, no weapons.

393
00:20:40,779 --> 00:20:46,807
Just one unarmed black man versus
one unarmed, openly gay dean.

394
00:20:49,468 --> 00:20:51,963
Now move that nest, please.

395
00:20:55,036 --> 00:20:58,656
Just a hair back Domingo, it's
like you're breathing for me.

00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:02,936
I have called this
press conference

405
00:22:02,961 --> 00:22:06,464
because I have been less
than honest with the public.

406
00:22:06,477 --> 00:22:09,954
You know me as the openly gay dean
of Greendale Community College,

407
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:14,318
but that doesn't even begin
to describe what I really am.

408
00:22:14,326 --> 00:22:16,300
I belong to one of
the most marginalized

409
00:22:16,305 --> 00:22:20,432
and least openly honest
groups in America.

410
00:22:22,749 --> 00:22:24,662
I am

411
00:22:25,381 --> 00:22:26,828
a politician.

412
00:22:27,481 --> 00:22:28,929
Now what does that mean?

413
00:22:28,949 --> 00:22:31,557
Are politicians like you?
Well we look like you,

414
00:22:31,564 --> 00:22:34,507
but we will say and do
whatever we have to

415
00:22:34,518 --> 00:22:37,111
in order to acquire
and keep our jobs.

416
00:22:37,123 --> 00:22:44,322
It means nothing I say and very few
of the things I think can be trusted.

417
00:22:46,717 --> 00:22:51,665
I am tired of being in this particular
closet so I am coming out now.

418
00:22:53,589 --> 00:22:55,480
I only hope

419
00:22:55,484 --> 00:23:00,232
that you can accept an openly
political person on your board.

420
00:23:01,391 --> 00:23:02,903
If not,

421
00:23:03,821 --> 00:23:05,305
I understand.

422
00:23:06,057 --> 00:23:07,602
Thank you.

423
00:23:12,877 --> 00:23:16,195
It's just faster if I get to my office this
way. We don't need any pictures of this.

424
00:23:16,949 --> 00:23:19,318
I can't believe the Dean got
kicked off the school board

425
00:23:19,332 --> 00:23:21,271
just for admitting
he's political.

426
00:23:21,285 --> 00:23:21,971
Yeah.

427
00:23:21,978 --> 00:23:24,392
Some groups take longer than
others to gain acceptance.

428
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:27,354
We like our politicians in the
closet because we're afraid,

429
00:23:27,366 --> 00:23:29,819
deep down, we're all
a little political.

430
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:33,173
- Any of you guys smell a bird murderer?
- I came here to apologize.

431
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:35,912
Well, I hope your apology comes
with a beak and hollow bones

432
00:23:35,924 --> 00:23:38,423
and a special magnet in its
head it uses to migrate.

433
00:23:38,429 --> 00:23:40,609
- You skipped wings.
- Insects have wings.

434
00:23:40,616 --> 00:23:41,596
I'm sorry.

435
00:23:41,609 --> 00:23:45,809
I'm sorry, Abed. I lost myself
in a role. It won't happen again.

436
00:23:45,828 --> 00:23:46,823
Two of them died.

437
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,003
There's one left. He's hanging on,

438
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:50,832
but I'm worried he's turning into
a symbol of my own innocence.

439
00:23:53,894 --> 00:23:55,207
Isn't Chang's play tonight?

440
00:23:55,218 --> 00:23:57,739
If any of you go, you're
supporting abuse.

441
00:23:57,758 --> 00:23:59,744
- Oh, dial it back, Annie.
- Oh.

442
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,064
Well, I'm definitely in.

443
00:24:01,084 --> 00:24:04,108
It'll be interesting to see how his fake
crying is different from his real crying.

444
00:24:04,122 --> 00:24:06,601
Well I'm a big fan of
the performing arts,

445
00:24:06,618 --> 00:24:08,881
but I'll go to Chang's play anyway.

446
00:24:08,893 --> 00:24:10,828
Karate Kid adaptation?
Karate Kid adaptation?

447
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:12,486
Karate Kid adaptation?
Karate Kid adaptation?

448
00:24:12,498 --> 00:24:14,147
Karate Kid adaptation?

449
00:24:28,409 --> 00:24:29,481
Karate Kid adaptation?

450
00:24:29,493 --> 00:24:33,099
Okay. I might.
I'm catching up.

451
00:24:37,877 --> 00:24:40,278
Directors have a saying.

452
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:45,020
Actors are worthless,
empty-headed homunculi,

453
00:24:45,028 --> 00:24:49,237
but the right one,
in the right role

454
00:24:49,261 --> 00:24:50,801
can change the world.

455
00:24:50,807 --> 00:24:52,061
Hm,

456
00:24:52,086 --> 00:24:53,987
I have found
the right one.

457
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:57,316
He's found the right
role, and tonight,

458
00:24:57,328 --> 00:24:59,362
your world changes.

459
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:00,798
You're welcome.

460
00:25:16,673 --> 00:25:19,012
- He replaced me with Annie Kim.
- Shh.

461
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:20,618
- Hee-ah!
- Ow.

462
00:25:20,631 --> 00:25:22,711
Sorry. You okay?

463
00:25:23,797 --> 00:25:26,298
You must be the new
people in apartment 20.

464
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:30,125
- What was that? Karate?
- Yeah, you know?

465
00:25:30,137 --> 00:25:33,082
Hey, me and some of my friends are
gonna have a party at the beach later.

466
00:25:33,095 --> 00:25:34,461
You should come.

467
00:25:35,453 --> 00:25:38,192
- Hey! Are you the repair man?
- Aye.

468
00:25:38,207 --> 00:25:41,161
- Faucet's really leaking there.
- Aye.

469
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:44,882
- When are you gonna fix it?
- After.

470
00:25:44,888 --> 00:25:46,451
After what?

471
00:25:47,103 --> 00:25:48,663
After, after.

472
00:25:50,973 --> 00:25:53,834
Come ask, leave boy
alone to train.

473
00:25:53,846 --> 00:25:57,964
You got a lot of nerve, old man.
But I like that. I like that.

474
00:25:57,978 --> 00:26:01,249
- Name a place.
- Tournament.

475
00:26:05,179 --> 00:26:06,398
Sergeant Miyagi.

476
00:26:06,421 --> 00:26:10,167
Yes, sir. Regret
to inform wife, sir.

477
00:26:13,797 --> 00:26:17,482
Complication at birth, sir.

478
00:26:19,394 --> 00:26:22,573
No doctor, it can't.

479
00:26:25,035 --> 00:26:26,496
Oh, shit.

480
00:26:27,934 --> 00:26:29,509
Oh, shit.

481
00:26:30,576 --> 00:26:32,561
- Please forgive me.
- Shh.

482
00:26:35,574 --> 00:26:38,807
No need fight anymore,
you proved point.

483
00:26:38,813 --> 00:26:41,721
What? That I could
take a beating?

484
00:26:41,732 --> 00:26:44,577
Every time I see
those guys,

485
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,814
they'll know they
got the best of me.

486
00:26:47,794 --> 00:26:49,227
Close eye.

487
00:27:05,671 --> 00:27:07,394
Get up, Daniel.

488
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:09,420
Get up!

489
00:27:20,067 --> 00:27:21,634
Yeah, woo woo!

490
00:27:22,313 --> 00:27:24,868
- You all right, LaRusso?
- Yeah, you missed my head.

491
00:27:25,464 --> 00:27:28,109
We did it, Mister Miyagi.
We did it.

492
00:27:33,691 --> 00:27:36,917
- I'm speechless.
- I forgot Chang was up there.

493
00:27:36,923 --> 00:27:37,697
Me, too.

494
00:27:37,717 --> 00:27:42,035
It's such a relief to be able to support
him out of something other than fear.

495
00:27:42,041 --> 00:27:43,894
I guess all that suffering
Chang endured paid off.

496
00:27:43,907 --> 00:27:45,651
It's not what the play suggests,
but you have to wonder

497
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:48,048
if it wouldn't have been better
for Daniel to get beat up even more.

498
00:27:48,056 --> 00:27:52,015
I am at a total loss about what
lesson to learn from any of this.

499
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,546
- Maybe that's the lesson.
- Hm.

500
00:27:55,104 --> 00:27:58,082
- I lost a button.
- Maybe we all lost a button.

501
00:28:00,338 --> 00:28:01,657
Hey, hey guys!

502
00:28:04,145 --> 00:28:05,827
Thank you so much.

503
00:28:05,834 --> 00:28:10,596
- Hey, thank you for making me do this.
- You're welcome. Congratulations.

504
00:28:11,515 --> 00:28:13,680
- I'm jealous.
- No, no, don't be.

505
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,107
Believe me, I sit
in my dressing room

506
00:28:15,115 --> 00:28:18,729
and all I dream about is a
white picket fence and a dog.

507
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,882
I don't have those either.

508
00:28:21,734 --> 00:28:23,172
Chang, let's go.

509
00:28:23,637 --> 00:28:26,478
I guess all the actors go to some
sort of actor bar together.

510
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:29,368
So, I'll see you guys at school.
Bye.

511
00:28:37,186 --> 00:28:40,840
Hey, I know this great bar for
people that don't hate themselves.

512
00:28:41,623 --> 00:28:43,214
What do you say?

513
00:28:43,909 --> 00:28:45,731
My lady.

514
00:28:46,942 --> 00:28:48,576
My lord.

515
00:28:53,366 --> 00:28:57,862
We are gathered here today to celebrate
the release of this bird into these skies.

516
00:28:57,875 --> 00:29:01,746
That its now fully formed wings may
find purchase upon the four winds.

517
00:29:01,765 --> 00:29:04,112
If anyone would like to say
something, now's the time.

518
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:11,453
Oh, I'll always remember how you
kept me from getting email for a week.

519
00:29:11,479 --> 00:29:14,450
And that chirp you do
when you want more bread.

520
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:15,769
Yeah, that one.

521
00:29:15,789 --> 00:29:18,593
And now everyone, please put on
your cat masks and finger wings.

522
00:29:23,619 --> 00:29:27,494
With these cat masks, we remind you that
this place can no longer be your home,

523
00:29:27,508 --> 00:29:29,453
but with the fluttering
of these wings,

524
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:31,923
we symbolically join your
flight into the natural world.

525
00:29:31,934 --> 00:29:33,095
Wings everyone.

526
00:29:38,353 --> 00:29:40,313
Okay. You can go now.

527
00:29:40,318 --> 00:29:42,142
Yeah. Off you go.

528
00:29:42,154 --> 00:29:45,220
Time to go, little bird,
that's just the way it is.

529
00:29:45,232 --> 00:29:46,901
Whee!

530
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:50,112
Aw.

531
00:29:51,887 --> 00:29:53,820
- Then it's done.
- You did the right thing, Abed.

532
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:56,847
Thanks to you, that bird has his
whole bird life ahead of him, to fly,

533
00:29:56,866 --> 00:29:58,867
meet lady birds, even
start a bird family.

534
00:29:58,881 --> 00:30:00,255
You made a difference.

535
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,160
- Aw.
- Abed.

536
00:30:12,819 --> 00:30:19,819
