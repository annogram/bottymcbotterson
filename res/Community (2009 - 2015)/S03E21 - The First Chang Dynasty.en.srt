1
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:05,081
A new day has dawned
at Greendale Community College.

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:06,875
Some said we'd never bounce back...

3
00:00:07,073 --> 00:00:09,712
...after the events
of the Star-Burns wake riot...

4
00:00:09,909 --> 00:00:11,718
...instigated
by the Greendale Seven.

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,448
But today, the guilty parties
have been expelled, enrolment is up...

6
00:00:15,647 --> 00:00:17,923
...and tuition
is more affordable than ever.

7
00:00:18,117 --> 00:00:20,064
The architect
of this modern-day miracle?

8
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:22,597
Security Chief
Benjamin Franklin Chang.

9
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:26,100
A man who has brought security,
harmony and success...

10
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:29,272
...to what is becoming the area's
premier community college.

11
00:00:29,461 --> 00:00:33,000
Greendale's never been better.
Thanks, Chang.

12
00:00:33,198 --> 00:00:36,146
- You see? It's not the real dean.
- Of course.

13
00:00:36,335 --> 00:00:39,442
The head of security at Greendale
Community College has kidnapped...

14
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:42,847
...the dean and replaced him
with a "deanelganger."

15
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:45,148
When you say it that way,
it sounds ridiculous.

16
00:00:45,344 --> 00:00:47,154
The word we used
was "doppeldeaner."

17
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:49,588
Look, I hate cops.

18
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:53,130
You have to do something.

19
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:54,320
Isn't this a felony?

20
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:56,659
Chang is holding a man
against his will.

21
00:00:56,856 --> 00:01:00,167
The real dean never would have
expelled us. He loved us.

22
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:03,773
Unfortunately,
love is not admissible evidence.

23
00:01:05,831 --> 00:01:09,075
Love is not admissible evidence

24
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,780
I'm working on a cop opera.

25
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:15,049
- "Copera!"
- "Police-ical."

26
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,346
Fine. We'll get some proof.

27
00:01:17,543 --> 00:01:20,718
No, you won't. If I catch any of you
within 50 feet of Greendale...

28
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,825
...I'll throw you all in jail.

29
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,829
Thanks for the hot water.

30
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:29,060
Wait. Copera!

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

32
00:02:01,453 --> 00:02:03,865
I'm watching you. Move along.

33
00:02:04,957 --> 00:02:08,735
How's the planning going
for my birthday Chang-stravaganza?

34
00:02:08,927 --> 00:02:12,068
Magician's booked, invitations went out
to the board and the Budweiser frogs.

35
00:02:12,264 --> 00:02:15,211
- Perfect.
- Yeah, one little snag.

36
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:17,038
See, we're running out of money...

37
00:02:17,236 --> 00:02:20,115
...with the students dropping out
and the cost of your throne...

38
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:23,514
It's a prescription throne.
I have back mumps.

39
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,018
Don't look it up. It's rare.

40
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:26,383
But you might be right.

41
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:29,526
We should free up some revenue
for entertainment at the party.

42
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:31,592
Where's my "deanel-Chang-er?"

43
00:02:35,487 --> 00:02:36,795
Fire the custodial staff.

44
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,401
Okay. Cool.

45
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:42,805
Think I could get out early?
My wife's getting her braces off...

46
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,271
- No.
- Okay.

47
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:54,882
I love how binoculars make things
seem like they're close.

48
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:57,713
- Like telephones for your eyes.
- Telephones for your eyes.

49
00:02:57,911 --> 00:02:59,413
Snagged one of those flyers.

50
00:03:00,145 --> 00:03:02,251
Chang kidnaps the dean,
now a birthday party?

51
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,096
It's just like Stalin
back in Russia times.

52
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:07,628
Dance-off? Sundae bar?

53
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:09,663
One of those
Ed Hardy street magicians?

54
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:15,098
What kind of monster would...?
Photo booth with props.

55
00:03:15,294 --> 00:03:18,832
Chang's holding the dean, but no way
we're getting past those guards.

56
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,477
We need somebody on the inside.

57
00:03:22,401 --> 00:03:24,278
I may know a guy.

58
00:03:24,469 --> 00:03:28,611
And the Air Conditioning Repair Annex
won't admit to what's going on.

59
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:33,957
But the fact is,
wherever there is air, we have eyes.

60
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:36,490
- Gross.
- Suffice it to say...

61
00:03:36,682 --> 00:03:38,959
...if Chang
were holding your dean captive...

62
00:03:39,151 --> 00:03:41,359
...it'd be pretty foolish
to hold him on campus.

63
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:46,002
It'd be even more foolish to hold him in
the central air room in the cafeteria...

64
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:47,295
...which we monitor.

65
00:03:47,492 --> 00:03:49,028
Oh, no, Jeffrey.

66
00:03:49,228 --> 00:03:52,766
Looks like PB&J again.

67
00:03:53,265 --> 00:03:55,268
You win the bet.

68
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:58,937
- So he's in the cafeteria building?
- Suppose he is. In the basement.

69
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:00,639
Suppose you wanted to get to him.

70
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,945
Suppose you managed to make it
past the guards at the front.

71
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:05,314
There's 50 more inside.

72
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:08,616
Armed to the teeth with stun batons
and misplaced sexual aggression.

73
00:04:08,814 --> 00:04:10,350
Let's say you get past them.

74
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,531
Then you get to meet
Chang's number one, Joshua.

75
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:17,064
A 4-foot-10, 105-pound bucket
of piss and zit cream.

76
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,964
I cannot express to you
how much I hate this kid.

77
00:04:20,158 --> 00:04:23,139
Now, beyond that dog-sneeze
in a pair of Reeboks...

78
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:25,809
...is a state-of-the-art keypad
on the basement door.

79
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:28,809
And just for extra fun,
they change the code every day...

80
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:31,675
...and the only copy
is locked up in Chang's office.

81
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:33,380
Now, just for a lark...

82
00:04:33,572 --> 00:04:35,848
...let's pretend you make it
to the basement door.

83
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,452
Who is there to greet you?

84
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:41,148
Another guard and another lock
to which there is only one key.

85
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:44,259
And where is that key?

86
00:04:49,021 --> 00:04:50,329
Well, where is it?

87
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:53,134
Oh, sorry, it's very clear in my head.

88
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:55,704
Key is around Chang's neck.
The point is...

89
00:04:55,894 --> 00:04:58,136
...you're not getting down there
without our help.

90
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:01,540
- So help us.
- We have no horse in this race, but...

91
00:05:01,733 --> 00:05:04,043
...there is one thing we want.

92
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:08,584
Not a lot of people
get a second chance.

93
00:05:08,774 --> 00:05:11,346
Just you and probably Obama.

94
00:05:13,612 --> 00:05:15,456
Give it some thought.

95
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:21,593
- Troy's intel, Greendale is impregnable.
- So, what do we do?

96
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:23,961
One answer. Elaborate heist?
Elaborate heist?

97
00:05:24,156 --> 00:05:26,363
We'll need disguises.
I do a great swami.

98
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:30,233
Of course, it works best with a cobra,
but cut me a length of garden hose...

99
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,706
Forgetting that if we get caught,
we go to jail?

100
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:36,072
You know how long someone as
sarcastic as I am would last in prison?

101
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:40,615
Such a long time. There's got to be
a practical way to do this.

102
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:41,911
There is another way in.

103
00:05:42,808 --> 00:05:45,050
If I enrol in the a.c. school,
they'll help us.

104
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:47,120
We could walk in and out.

105
00:05:47,312 --> 00:05:49,793
I'll have to move out
and into a.c. school housing...

106
00:05:49,981 --> 00:05:52,656
...and I won't be able to hang out
with you guys anymore...

107
00:05:52,851 --> 00:05:55,764
...or have a relationship,
or use the word sensational.

108
00:05:55,954 --> 00:05:58,798
Troy, we are not losing you
to save the dean...

109
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:01,903
...or Greendale, or anything, ever.

110
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:08,141
Don't be so dramatic, Troy.
The answer is simple.

111
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:11,406
- We have to plan an elaborate heist.
- Yes.

112
00:06:11,603 --> 00:06:12,843
Great, I'll get my turban.

113
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:16,781
Everyone except Pierce
has to plan an elaborate heist.

114
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:27,694
Happy birthday, Ben.
On behalf of the school board.

115
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:31,629
Shower organiser?
Are you guys psychic?

116
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:34,497
Well, you deserve it.
You have worked wonders here.

117
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:37,675
Oh, you boners.
Now, go party your butts off.

118
00:06:37,863 --> 00:06:39,968
Your butt could use it, Richie.

119
00:06:47,372 --> 00:06:50,411
Listen up, men. Keep an extra deep
lookout for the Greendale Seven.

120
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,987
I won't have them
ruining my 25th birthday.

121
00:06:53,178 --> 00:06:56,159
Yes, sir.
By the way, your cake just arrived.

122
00:06:57,649 --> 00:07:01,028
Shirley will enter first through
the loading dock disguised as the chef.

123
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,358
From there,
she'll head into the kitchen.

124
00:07:03,555 --> 00:07:06,661
You had time to build a working
water fountain, and I'm a pinecone?

125
00:07:06,858 --> 00:07:11,329
Chang eats the sun
And drinks the skies

126
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:16,536
And they both go with him
When he dies

127
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:19,012
Once in, she'll unload the goods.

128
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:27,321
This girl in Chicago
won't stop Facebooking me.

129
00:07:27,512 --> 00:07:30,550
Looks like J-swag's
going deep dish.

130
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:35,362
Then it's time forphase two:
toilet trouble.

131
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:38,398
Oh, crap. Somebody call a plumber.

132
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:41,935
Sounds you schnooks got a flood
the size of my wife's attitude problem.

133
00:07:42,127 --> 00:07:43,834
You guys aren't the usual plumbers.

134
00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:46,305
Oh, Mr. Brand Loyalty over here.

135
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:49,877
Okay, give me your names for the
report, in case Chang wants to know...

136
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:52,913
...why his birthday party turned
into The Poseidon Adventure.

137
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:55,084
Okay, okay. Follow me, then.

138
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:57,220
Finally. Oof baboof with you two.

139
00:07:57,409 --> 00:08:00,482
Here's your problem. You people
gotta start chewing your food.

140
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,819
We have to tap
into the hydraulic flap valve...

141
00:08:03,014 --> 00:08:05,016
...so don't be alarmed
if things get noisy.

142
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:07,026
Like my wife's mouth.

143
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,598
If we break through this wall
into Chang's office...

144
00:08:09,788 --> 00:08:11,995
...we'll have access
to the basement door codes.

145
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,329
I'll take care
of cancelling the magician.

146
00:08:14,526 --> 00:08:17,235
Yeah, sorry, Mr. Nightshade,
gig's cancelled.

147
00:08:17,863 --> 00:08:19,774
- How's the guard?
- Boys are pathetic.

148
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:23,413
Two days of Facebook with this Joshua
kid and he's eating out of my hands.

149
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:25,206
"Got a new flavour lip balm.

150
00:08:25,403 --> 00:08:29,011
Meet me at Chili's in 10 minutes."
Sheep.

151
00:08:29,207 --> 00:08:31,518
I wanna reiterate
this should be the only time...

152
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:34,317
- ...you seduce a child over the Internet.
- I know.

153
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,289
Chili's? Sick!

154
00:08:37,482 --> 00:08:39,086
Hey, bro, you watch my post?

155
00:08:39,284 --> 00:08:41,423
Yeah, whatever. What's up?

156
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:45,230
I'm in. Cue the abracadabra.

157
00:08:45,423 --> 00:08:47,062
Is that me in my swami disguise?

158
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:48,966
No, Pierce, for the last time...

159
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:52,734
...you're in the getaway van because
your swami act is notoriously horrible.

160
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:54,808
A, that is racist.

161
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,312
B, swamis can't drive,
they're Indians.

162
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:01,815
Pierce, just do your part. Leave
the entertainment to Britta and me.

163
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:11,822
Ricky Nightshade,
the rock 'n' roll magician.

164
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:14,624
I'm starting. I need a volunteer.

165
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:17,857
I'll kill anyone who raises their hand.

166
00:09:21,192 --> 00:09:23,605
Pick a card and look at it.

167
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:27,033
Strap him!

168
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:39,448
I'm in.

169
00:09:49,087 --> 00:09:52,763
Okay, it was just my head before,
but now I'm really in.

170
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:56,201
Bingo.

171
00:09:58,163 --> 00:10:02,236
Four, one, two, six.

172
00:10:04,135 --> 00:10:06,308
I'm in. Where's the key?

173
00:10:08,807 --> 00:10:10,480
- I'm in.
- I know.

174
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:12,383
Everybody else got to say it.

175
00:10:15,313 --> 00:10:17,191
Is this your card?

176
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:20,357
I don't remember.

177
00:10:23,088 --> 00:10:26,092
Nightshade! Nightshade!

178
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,239
Greetings, greetings,
baba ghanoush.

179
00:10:29,427 --> 00:10:31,032
Take me to the birthday boy.

180
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,109
Wait a minute. Pierce?

181
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,114
No, not knowing this Pierce. I...

182
00:10:37,302 --> 00:10:41,080
I am a mystical swami. I come
to boogie down. I'm boogying down.

183
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:42,774
Hey!

184
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:45,188
Jeff, we've been made. Cover me.

185
00:10:46,011 --> 00:10:47,615
Winger!

186
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,253
- No!
- Everything all right, Ben?

187
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:53,361
Peachy keen, Avril Lavigne.

188
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:55,588
Nathan,
tell me you got eyes on the dean.

189
00:10:57,756 --> 00:11:00,363
Negative,
the pixie has left the toadstool.

190
00:11:00,558 --> 00:11:04,563
- No! Where's my monitor?
- The pixie has left the toadstool.

191
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,442
Gotcha. Code Chang.

192
00:11:09,634 --> 00:11:12,376
All units converge
on the south library hallway.

193
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:14,517
The best part
is that at a certain point...

194
00:11:14,706 --> 00:11:17,312
...it's gonna look like the plan
is failing.

195
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:20,286
But that's when it's gonna turn out
that the failing plan...

196
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,926
...was all part of the plan.

197
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:28,154
Chang eats the sun
And drinks the sky

198
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:45,981
Johnny Passerby, this job's bigger
than my wife's credit bill at Marshalls.

199
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:47,514
They got great stuff, I know.

200
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:49,879
I need your dean for approval.

201
00:11:50,442 --> 00:11:54,015
Craig. Is that A-I or I-A? I forget.

202
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:58,618
Oof baboof,
I spilled plumber's acid all over youse.

203
00:11:58,817 --> 00:12:00,764
- What do I do?
- Take off your clothes.

204
00:12:00,952 --> 00:12:02,796
Nathan,
tell me you got eyes on the dean.

205
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:05,433
Negative,
the pixie has left the toadstool.

206
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:09,765
Repeat,
the pixie has left the toadstool.

207
00:12:11,996 --> 00:12:13,806
Jeffrey! Oh, hey, Britta.

208
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:18,313
How the Chang?

209
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:22,952
I'm contaminated with plumber's acid,
but they're coming back with a lotion.

210
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:40,665
Sarcastic claps.

211
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,168
Pretty clever.

212
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,307
A plan that looked like it failed
and then turned out to work.

213
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,875
Too bad your real plan really failed.

214
00:12:49,467 --> 00:12:51,744
- What's so funny?
- You idiot.

215
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,474
The plan was for the plan
to seem like it was failing.

216
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:57,552
You think you caught us,
but we made it out with the real dean.

217
00:12:57,743 --> 00:12:59,221
Ocean's Eleven, baby.

218
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:02,187
Pierce, I'm the real dean.

219
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,918
Getting caught the first time
was part of the plan.

220
00:13:05,116 --> 00:13:07,791
This time is because we suck.

221
00:13:07,986 --> 00:13:10,729
Shirley, where the hell
did you come from?

222
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:20,976
- You can't hold us here forever.
- I don't need to.

223
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:24,443
I just wouldn't want you to leave
before the big fireworks show.

224
00:13:24,636 --> 00:13:25,672
Fireworks show?

225
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:29,114
It's a surprise for the end of the night
planned by "the dean."

226
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:33,886
Only, silly dean, he stored
all the fireworks in the records room.

227
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:36,024
And when the works
"accidentally" go off...

228
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:38,717
...when I hit final note
on my awesome keytar solo...

229
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:41,797
...they'll burn up the records
and all evidence of my misdeeds.

230
00:13:41,986 --> 00:13:44,626
Chang, you're insane.
You're still into keytar?

231
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:46,427
We'll tell the board what you did.

232
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,934
You think
they'll believe the Greendale Seven...

233
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:52,075
...and worst dean ever over the guy
who nailed an awesome solo?

234
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:55,211
You're gonna burn down the school
and kill everyone.

235
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,313
Fire can't go through doors, stupid.
It's not a ghost.

236
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:06,980
This is a bit of a long shot, but I don't
suppose any of you paid my rent?

237
00:14:07,178 --> 00:14:10,318
Thank you, everyone,
for joining in my celebration.

238
00:14:11,015 --> 00:14:14,428
As many of you know,
I ate my twin sister in utero.

239
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:19,693
So on my birthday,
I try to remember I'm a winner.

240
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:21,962
This one's for you, Connie.

241
00:14:27,232 --> 00:14:31,375
And a one, a two,
a Chang, Chang, Chang, four.

242
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:37,947
- We're all gonna die.
- We have to get out.

243
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:39,485
How?

244
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,668
- It's a miracle.
- Let's go. Let's go.

245
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:05,472
- Yes!
- Let's get out of here.

246
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:11,418
- No, Troy, you didn't.
- There's no time. We gotta go.

247
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,361
Six guards, two on scooters.

248
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:27,696
Chang started his solo. Nine minutes
to get to the records room.

249
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:31,466
- We'll need a distraction.
- You heard the lady. Take your tops off.

250
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:33,875
I might have something.

251
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:37,774
I've been renting the school out
for raves on the weekend.

252
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:42,783
They call it Academania. It's mostly
hard house, some dubstep, but totally...

253
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:45,046
Perfect. Troy and Abed,
you make a run for it.

254
00:15:45,443 --> 00:15:48,447
Dean, I think it's time to party.

255
00:15:50,982 --> 00:15:52,860
- Hey!
- What the freak?

256
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:54,530
What's going on?

257
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,000
- No! No! No!
- You weigh nothing!

258
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,363
I can't see them.
There's too many of them.

259
00:16:10,101 --> 00:16:12,775
- Which wire do I cut?
- There's only one.

260
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:14,984
God, I hope I'm right.

261
00:16:27,852 --> 00:16:30,264
Study group.

262
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:34,630
You did it. So we're done, right?

263
00:16:34,826 --> 00:16:37,067
We're done? Done, done, done?

264
00:16:37,261 --> 00:16:41,369
Not done.
You've foiled me for the last time.

265
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:50,585
So it ends as it began.

266
00:16:50,775 --> 00:16:52,049
It didn't begin this way.

267
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:56,620
- What the hell's going on in here?
- Hey, fellas.

268
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:59,921
I just caught the Greendale Seven
trying to burn down the school.

269
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:02,428
I'm a hero. How about that cake?

270
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,463
He's lying. He kidnapped the dean.

271
00:17:04,655 --> 00:17:07,829
We gathered that much. Found
these two slap-fighting in the hallway.

272
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:12,601
- You stole my life!
- It is hard out there for a fake Moby!

273
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:17,278
Carl, Richie, let me ex-Chang.

274
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:22,349
I'm not getting paid, am I?

275
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:24,818
Hey!

276
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:27,953
So a madman
in a Napoleon costume...

277
00:17:28,146 --> 00:17:30,683
...ran the school into the ground
and almost blew it up?

278
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,295
Yeah. And on our watch.

279
00:17:33,484 --> 00:17:36,557
- What happened to us?
- Well, I have a drinking problem.

280
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:37,926
We're gonna get fired.

281
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:41,297
Only a matter of time until everyone
finds out what happened here.

282
00:17:41,492 --> 00:17:43,369
Nobody can sit
on something this big.

283
00:17:43,561 --> 00:17:45,097
I'll sit on it.

284
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:48,704
When I became dean,
I made a pledge...

285
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,643
...to swallow this school's failures
and spit out degrees...

286
00:17:51,836 --> 00:17:56,444
...because that's what deans do.

287
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:57,779
You'd do that for us?

288
00:17:57,976 --> 00:18:01,445
No. I'd do it for Greendale.

289
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,021
It's great to have you back, Craig.

290
00:18:04,215 --> 00:18:07,288
It's almost as if
you were never unknowingly gone.

291
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:09,227
Yard-margs at Skeeper's.

292
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,527
Perfect. I left my credit card there.
Thanks, Craig.

293
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:16,397
You guys saved me.

294
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,973
I don't know
how I will ever repay you.

295
00:18:20,298 --> 00:18:22,278
You already have.

296
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:30,277
Troy, you don't have to do this.

297
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:32,786
The a.c. school
has no claim on your soul.

298
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:35,253
No, but I do.
A man's only as good as his word...

299
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:38,859
...or his nod through a camera
to a guy with a button.

300
00:18:44,455 --> 00:18:47,368
It's time. Say your goodbyes.

301
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,240
Shirley, never change.

302
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:54,365
Or do, if you want, I'm not your boss.

303
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:56,671
Oh, honey.

304
00:19:03,307 --> 00:19:04,684
Never wear a rubber.

305
00:19:10,548 --> 00:19:11,892
Never listen to Pierce.

306
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:19,595
When you finally finish
that jigsaw puzzle...

307
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,864
...will you tell me what kind of boat
is at the end of that dock?

308
00:19:30,568 --> 00:19:32,412
This is a lock of my hair.

309
00:19:34,405 --> 00:19:35,544
Creepy.

310
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,403
All right, let's go.

311
00:20:09,473 --> 00:20:12,818
Abed? What did he say to you?

312
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:15,991
He said, "I know you hate
when people do this in movies."

313
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:18,355
Sorry I got emotional.

314
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,469
Troy Barnes.

315
00:20:31,829 --> 00:20:34,105
Welcome home.

316
00:20:37,935 --> 00:20:40,609
I'm really digging this hard house.

317
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:44,548
It's quite a groove.
This is my school.

318
00:20:44,742 --> 00:20:49,020
It's called Greendale
and I'm the dean of the entire school.

319
00:20:49,213 --> 00:20:53,720
I mean, I wasn't for a while,
but it's a long story.

320
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,798
You guys, everybody, you should
come by during the day sometime.

321
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,697
It's totally different.

322
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:02,835
Really, stop by.
It'll blow your minds.

323
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:05,234
You can meet my best friend,
Jeffrey.

324
00:21:06,397 --> 00:21:09,709
Sure, I'll take a back rub.
Who's asking?

325
00:21:10,305 --> 00:21:16,531
