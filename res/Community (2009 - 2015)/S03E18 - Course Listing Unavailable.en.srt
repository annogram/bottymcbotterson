1
00:00:04,215 --> 00:00:06,023
Okay. Ahh.

2
00:00:06,143 --> 00:00:10,172
Um, my name is Alex Osbourne,

3
00:00:10,234 --> 00:00:13,632
and if you're watching this,
it means I'm dead.

4
00:00:13,755 --> 00:00:18,092
Or I'm just showing you.
Uh, but I'm probably dead.

5
00:00:18,609 --> 00:00:21,874
To my ex-wife Magda,
I leave herpes.

6
00:00:21,913 --> 00:00:23,780
But she knows that,
it's dealt with.

7
00:00:24,033 --> 00:00:26,228
As for my collection
of Styx albums,

8
00:00:26,243 --> 00:00:27,977
I leave that to no one.

9
00:00:27,999 --> 00:00:30,968
Because that's who appreciated
Styx as much as me.

10
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:34,063
Finally, there's a kid named
Abed who makes movies

11
00:00:34,094 --> 00:00:37,447
at my community college,
and to him I leave the task

12
00:00:37,477 --> 00:00:40,083
of creating a video tribute
of my life.

13
00:00:40,437 --> 00:00:44,757
What follows is some general
purpose footage that he can use.

14
00:00:45,584 --> 00:00:47,018
[Kissing noises]

15
00:00:47,019 --> 00:00:48,586
[Mimics rocket engine]

16
00:00:48,587 --> 00:00:50,188
Where did you get this?

17
00:00:50,189 --> 00:00:52,424
Some one-armed guy with a scar
on his face dropped it off.

18
00:00:52,425 --> 00:00:53,725
He said he was
Star-Burns' lawyer.

19
00:00:53,726 --> 00:00:56,401
How one-armed was he?
Tell me when to stop.

20
00:00:58,564 --> 00:01:00,832
- It was the other arm.
- You guys!

21
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:02,768
I feel oddly compelled
to fulfill his request.

22
00:01:02,769 --> 00:01:04,369
Would you guys help me write
obituary copy?

23
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:06,771
You mean like, "Star-Burns
died how he lived...

24
00:01:06,772 --> 00:01:08,273
in a meth lab explosion"?

25
00:01:08,274 --> 00:01:09,219
Can we turn this off?

26
00:01:09,258 --> 00:01:10,946
I'm not as comfortable
with death as you guys.

27
00:01:10,967 --> 00:01:14,514
- He's in a better place now.
- Yeah. The blu-ray shelf.

28
00:01:15,243 --> 00:01:16,527
What is that?

29
00:01:16,552 --> 00:01:18,134
Star-Burns also left me
his ashes.

30
00:01:18,167 --> 00:01:19,401
He requested they be burnt.

31
00:01:19,402 --> 00:01:20,702
I don't think he knows
how ashes work.

32
00:01:20,703 --> 00:01:22,053
The small one's his lizard.

33
00:01:22,054 --> 00:01:23,422
If we rub that,

34
00:01:23,423 --> 00:01:25,257
will he come out
and do celebrity impressions?

35
00:01:25,258 --> 00:01:27,624
- I don't think so.
- Then I want it out of here.

about this really serious thing
that's happened?

44
00:02:04,407 --> 00:02:06,829
Is it always about
the Holocaust with you people?

45
00:02:06,861 --> 00:02:10,102
I'm talking about Star-Burns,
you know, dying.

46
00:02:10,155 --> 00:02:12,499
I know it's sad, but death
is a natural part of life

47
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,872
and by the time
I finish this sentence,

48

100 people will have
died in China.

49
00:02:16,793 --> 00:02:19,833
Why did you stop talking?

50
00:02:19,862 --> 00:02:21,174
I have to call my pen pal.

51
00:02:21,191 --> 00:02:22,675
Star-Burns was a good man.

52
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,717
He barely sued me that time
I ran over his foot.

53
00:02:24,742 --> 00:02:26,877
I say we honor Star-Burns
by discussing him

54
00:02:26,901 --> 00:02:28,518
the same amount we did
when he was alive.

55
00:02:28,566 --> 00:02:30,680
Jeff, have some respect.

56
00:02:30,715 --> 00:02:32,933
He might have been
a scuzzy weirdo

57
00:02:32,951 --> 00:02:34,935
who shaved his sideburns
into star shapes...

It's Troy.
Are you okay?

60
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:40,859
Okay, good, I gotta go.
This costs $7.

61
00:02:40,899 --> 00:02:45,454
But he was also a classmate,
a kinda sorta friend sometimes

62
00:02:45,474 --> 00:02:47,558
and above all, a human being.

63
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,990
He touched all our lives.

64
00:02:49,014 --> 00:02:50,181
Annie has a point.

65
00:02:50,388 --> 00:02:52,623
The death of a peer,
especially at our age,

66
00:02:52,624 --> 00:02:54,808
can trigger a whole
range of emotions.

Britta, I could use some help
dealing with my grief.

74
00:03:07,155 --> 00:03:07,975
- Great.
- Yeah.

75
00:03:08,008 --> 00:03:13,012
I was hoping you'd say that,
because... I came prepared.

76
00:03:14,418 --> 00:03:16,207
You seemed smarter
than me when I met you.

77

Thank you.

For the purposes
of this exercise,

79
00:03:18,987 --> 00:03:21,323
I am Star-Burns.

80
00:03:21,344 --> 00:03:23,862
Tell me the things you never got
a chance to say to me.

81
00:03:27,737 --> 00:03:30,406
Come on, guys,
you can ask me anything.

82
00:03:30,407 --> 00:03:31,457
What's heaven like?

83
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:33,942
Uh, I don't know.
Glittery.

84
00:03:33,943 --> 00:03:36,245
- Ask me something else.
- Have you seen Tim Russert?

85
00:03:36,246 --> 00:03:39,114
Guys, you are doing this wrong.
Ask me something personal.

86
00:03:39,115 --> 00:03:40,532
Star-Burns,
I didn't know you that well,

87
00:03:40,533 --> 00:03:42,001
but why did you smell
exactly like salami?

88
00:03:42,002 --> 00:03:44,336
- Abed.
- I got one. Where's my comb?

89
00:03:44,337 --> 00:03:45,921
- I don't know.
- Yep, it's him.

90
00:03:45,922 --> 00:03:47,756
Why did you tape that
switchblade to your ankle?

91
00:03:47,757 --> 00:03:49,458
Why did you always poop
with the stall door open?

92
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:50,643
Is it true you made out
with Britta?

93
00:03:50,644 --> 00:03:51,810
I don't see
how that's relevant.

94
00:03:51,811 --> 00:03:53,395
It was Fat Neil's
black light party.

95
00:03:53,396 --> 00:03:55,848
Vicki saw you.
If that's true...

96
00:03:55,849 --> 00:03:59,652
if... maybe it was because
she was really drunk

97
00:03:59,653 --> 00:04:00,802
and she had just found out

98
00:04:00,803 --> 00:04:02,671
that her first boyfriend
was getting married.

99
00:04:02,672 --> 00:04:04,156
If you guys are gonna
do this wrong,

100
00:04:04,157 --> 00:04:05,574
then I'm gonna take these off.

I'm sorry, Chang,
this stuff is too extreme.

117
00:04:53,356 --> 00:04:55,958
This is a community college,
not an inner-city High School.

118
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:58,043
It's a community college
where a degenerate

119
00:04:58,044 --> 00:05:00,329
just blew himself up
with stolen lab equipment.

120
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,331
To be fair,
it was the crystal meth

121
00:05:02,332 --> 00:05:05,334
inside the stolen lab equipment
that blew him up.

how the sausage gets made.

125
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,541
Well, I'll tell you
how the sausage gets made.

126
00:05:12,542 --> 00:05:14,876
It's a lot of ground meat and it
gets stuffed into a casing

127
00:05:14,877 --> 00:05:17,212
that looks like a cross between
a dude's dong and a poop.

128
00:05:17,213 --> 00:05:19,982
I don't know how that helps
me, but please leave.

00:05:49,078 --> 00:05:51,380

00:05:56,386 --> 00:05:59,521
Britta! Why are you making us
feel these things?

142
00:05:59,522 --> 00:06:01,256
We need to bring
our emotions to the surface

143
00:06:01,257 --> 00:06:02,524
and explore them.

144
00:06:02,525 --> 00:06:04,093
Does it always
have to be puppies though?

145
00:06:04,094 --> 00:06:05,611
Oh, come on, everybody.

146
00:06:05,612 --> 00:06:07,613
This is a completely
unnecessary process.

147
00:06:07,614 --> 00:06:09,364
What Jeff's doing right now
is called denial

148
00:06:09,365 --> 00:06:11,433
and it is the first
of five stages of grief

149
00:06:11,434 --> 00:06:13,306
that ends with acceptance.

150
00:06:13,342 --> 00:06:15,276
- Name any other stage.
- What are you, my final?

151
00:06:15,323 --> 00:06:17,358
Maybe we don't need
grief counseling.

152
00:06:17,407 --> 00:06:19,107
But seems like
the least we could do

153
00:06:19,108 --> 00:06:20,743
is have a memorial
or something.

154
00:06:20,744 --> 00:06:23,078
Oh, yes, we could
have a little service

155
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:24,463
and I could bring
some of my brownies

156
00:06:24,464 --> 00:06:26,381
<i>and I guess someone
should sing Ave Maria.</i>

157
00:06:26,382 --> 00:06:28,000

how did the school respond?
