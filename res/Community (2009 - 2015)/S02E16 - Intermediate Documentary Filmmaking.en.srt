1
00:00:01,179 --> 00:00:03,117
It`s H, O... H, A, W, T...

2
00:00:03,117 --> 00:00:05,011
Guys! What happened?

3
00:00:05,046 --> 00:00:06,501
Apparently they found him unconscious

4
00:00:06,503 --> 00:00:07,764
on a park bench.

5
00:00:08,022 --> 00:00:09,195
Oh, my god!

6
00:00:09,214 --> 00:00:10,018
Is he okay?

7
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:11,837
We don't know. We just got here.

8
00:00:12,034 --> 00:00:13,718
He's ready for visitors now.

9
00:00:13,718 --> 00:00:15,189
He's in 10-23.

10
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:18,804
Hi.

11
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:21,510
Oh, welcome, my old friends.

12
00:00:22,417 --> 00:00:24,105
- Welcome.
- Pierce, what happened?

13
00:00:24,106 --> 00:00:25,830
We were all so worried.

14
00:00:25,832 --> 00:00:26,745
It was the pills.

15
00:00:26,745 --> 00:00:28,036
They just took me over.

16
00:00:28,038 --> 00:00:31,489
I saw awful, horrible things.
Demons, aliens,

17
00:00:32,518 --> 00:00:36,570
critters 3, something called
Bruce Willis surrogates.

18
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:38,993
Abed, what are you guys doing?

19
00:00:39,167 --> 00:00:40,731
It's ok, just act natural.

20
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:42,518
Pierce asked me to document his life

21
00:00:42,518 --> 00:00:44,170
for historical purposes.

22
00:00:44,264 --> 00:00:46,061
At first, I said, "no," because at the risk

23
00:00:46,063 --> 00:00:47,856
of sounding overly sensitive,
I feel intensely bored

24
00:00:47,856 --> 00:00:49,490
by Pierce as a subject.

25
00:00:49,776 --> 00:00:51,481
But I'm excited about
the narrative facility

26
00:00:51,481 --> 00:00:52,814
of the documentary format.

27
00:00:52,814 --> 00:00:53,965
It's easier to tell a complex story

28
00:00:53,966 --> 00:00:54,746
when you can just cut to people

29
00:00:54,746 --> 00:00:56,253
explaining things to the camera.

30
00:00:56,253 --> 00:00:58,118
I've called everyone here so that I could

31
00:00:58,118 --> 00:00:59,557
put my house in order,

32
00:00:59,558 --> 00:01:03,962
bequeath parting gifts, say my final words

33
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:05,144
to each of you.

34
00:01:05,144 --> 00:01:06,557
Final words?

35
00:01:06,795 --> 00:01:08,560
- You're gonna kill us?
- No, dummy.

36
00:01:08,561 --> 00:01:10,332
The pills wiped me out.

37
00:01:11,545 --> 00:01:12,659
I'm dying.

38
00:01:14,936 --> 00:01:16,362
I'm not really dying.

39
00:01:17,063 --> 00:01:19,055
Over the last few weeks,
it's become apparent

40
00:01:19,057 --> 00:01:21,655
how little respect this group has for me.

41
00:01:22,353 --> 00:01:26,277
So I've summoned them
here to exact my revenge.

42
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,740
See? Fish in a barrel.

45
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,182
I'm so sad. I don't know what to do.

46
00:01:58,182 --> 00:01:59,365
Usually, if I need to cheer up,

47
00:01:59,366 --> 00:02:01,275
I just make fun of Pierce, but now...

48
00:02:01,805 --> 00:02:03,212
It'd just make me sadder.

49
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:05,296
It's Gregory Hines all over again.

50
00:02:05,296 --> 00:02:06,742
Look, I'm sure he'll be fine.

51
00:02:06,743 --> 00:02:08,866
You know how dramatic Pierce gets.

52
00:02:08,867 --> 00:02:09,663
Remember when he had the hiccups

53
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:11,221
and pulled the fire alarm?

54
00:02:11,222 --> 00:02:12,247
Let's just try to relax.

55
00:02:12,247 --> 00:02:13,804
He's here because we relaxed.

56
00:02:13,805 --> 00:02:15,543
No, he's here because he relaxed,

57
00:02:15,544 --> 00:02:17,322
a handful of pills at a time.

58
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:19,316
That's all over now.

59
00:02:19,317 --> 00:02:20,930
We're here for him, so there's no point

60
00:02:20,931 --> 00:02:22,121
in feeling bad.

61
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,377
We know there's no point, Jeff.

62
00:02:23,378 --> 00:02:24,986
We kind of just felt like feeling it.

63
00:02:24,987 --> 00:02:26,895
Yeah, Jeff. What are you? Abed?

64
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:27,895
Oh, sorry, Abed.

65
00:02:27,896 --> 00:02:29,337
No problem. Doesn't bother me.

66
00:02:29,338 --> 00:02:32,340
Mr. Hawthorne is ready
to commence his bequeathings.

67
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,545
Shouldn't you be telling that
to an orderly?

68
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:37,225
He's gonna give us gifts.

69
00:02:37,227 --> 00:02:38,375
Oh, cool!

70
00:02:39,336 --> 00:02:40,317
I mean...

71
00:02:41,722 --> 00:02:42,733
Cool.

72
00:02:42,865 --> 00:02:44,325
I don't want Pierce to die.

73
00:02:44,473 --> 00:02:47,313
But if I'm gonna get bequeathed upon,

74
00:02:47,314 --> 00:02:49,631
I'd like to be bequeathed a drum kit

75
00:02:49,906 --> 00:02:52,246
or a signed photo of actor Levar Burton.

76
00:02:52,337 --> 00:02:53,986
Those would be my top two wishes.

77
00:02:53,987 --> 00:02:56,471
My third wish would be a million wishes.

78
00:02:57,269 --> 00:02:58,729
But I'd just use 'em all on

79
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,989
a million signed photos
of actor Levar Burton.

80
00:03:02,087 --> 00:03:03,525
Hello, Pierce.

81
00:03:04,068 --> 00:03:04,800
Hi.

82
00:03:04,801 --> 00:03:06,932
I got you some things from the gift shop

83
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:07,705
to cheer you up.

84
00:03:07,706 --> 00:03:09,473
I got you a John Grisham novel

85
00:03:09,473 --> 00:03:11,403
and a funny little coffee mug.

86
00:03:11,405 --> 00:03:13,663
You see how the flea's door mat
says "Dog, sweet dog"?

87
00:03:13,663 --> 00:03:15,816
Yeah. Shirley, we both know

88
00:03:15,817 --> 00:03:17,932
that you and I are the most hated
in the group.

89
00:03:17,933 --> 00:03:18,860
We do?

90
00:03:18,861 --> 00:03:21,932
And since, in my absence,
you'll be the new black sheep...

91
00:03:22,092 --> 00:03:24,120
I'm sorry. That's offensive.

92
00:03:24,276 --> 00:03:25,480
Black swan.

93
00:03:25,836 --> 00:03:27,300
I want you to have this.

94
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,646
It's a compact record and it

95
00:03:30,134 --> 00:03:32,473
contains an audio file of your study group

96
00:03:32,474 --> 00:03:34,759
talking about you while
you're out of the room.

97
00:03:34,817 --> 00:03:37,179
It's all here, burnt into this diskette

98
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,418
by optical lasers.

99
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,259
I don't believe you.

100
00:03:39,259 --> 00:03:41,135
I know it sounds like science fiction.

101
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:43,265
No, I don't believe
there's anything on that.

102
00:03:43,585 --> 00:03:46,877
Then I guess this is good-bye...Forever.

103
00:03:47,903 --> 00:03:49,478
Good... good-bye, Pierce.

104
00:03:55,449 --> 00:03:56,522
Smell you later.

105
00:03:56,808 --> 00:03:58,131
He said it's a recording of you all

106
00:03:58,132 --> 00:03:59,560
talking behind my back.

107
00:03:59,561 --> 00:04:00,550
That's ridiculous.

108
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,424
That's what I told him,

109
00:04:01,425 --> 00:04:03,110
because you all don't do that.

110
00:04:03,169 --> 00:04:04,221
Right?

111
00:04:09,947 --> 00:04:12,949
Mr. Hawthorne is requesting "sour face."

112
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:17,733
Knock, knock.

113
00:04:17,733 --> 00:04:19,144
Is that you, Death?

114
00:04:19,146 --> 00:04:20,711
- It's Britta.
- Oh.

115
00:04:20,711 --> 00:04:22,375
Before you speak, I just want to tell you

116
00:04:22,377 --> 00:04:23,935
that you don't have to give me anything.

117
00:04:23,937 --> 00:04:26,379
I am happy to just spend time with you.

118
00:04:26,735 --> 00:04:28,356
You know what Dylan Thomas
said about death?

119
00:04:28,358 --> 00:04:29,475
No, tell me.

120
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,824
Okay, bluff called.

121
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:33,502
Britta, you're the selfless one
in the group, right?

122
00:04:33,504 --> 00:04:35,502
I wouldn't know.
I haven't thought about myself in years.

123
00:04:35,502 --> 00:04:37,659
That's what makes you
the perfect recipient

124
00:04:37,661 --> 00:04:38,687
of this bequeathment.

125
00:04:38,689 --> 00:04:40,586
It's a check for $10,000

126
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:42,658
with the payee line blank,

127
00:04:42,752 --> 00:04:45,649
so that you can give it
to the charity of your choice.

128
00:04:45,651 --> 00:04:46,577
Wow.

129
00:04:46,899 --> 00:04:50,920
Pierce, this is... surprising.

130
00:04:51,755 --> 00:04:52,795
After what you gave Shirley,

131
00:04:52,795 --> 00:04:54,545
we thought you were playing mind games.

132
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:55,536
Thank you.

133
00:04:59,831 --> 00:05:00,910
Of course, if you are so inclined,

134
00:05:00,911 --> 00:05:02,858
you could always write
your own name in there.

135
00:05:06,716 --> 00:05:07,732
Toodles.

136
00:05:08,257 --> 00:05:10,050
I don't want to die in a place like this.

137
00:05:10,295 --> 00:05:11,367
People shouldn't die in the same place

138
00:05:11,369 --> 00:05:12,492
as People magazines do.

139
00:05:12,494 --> 00:05:14,487
I hope to die surrounded by my family.

140
00:05:14,487 --> 00:05:15,728
That's the only way I agreed to be

141
00:05:15,728 --> 00:05:16,750
surrounded by my family.

142
00:05:16,752 --> 00:05:18,091
Me and Abed have an agreement.

143
00:05:18,091 --> 00:05:19,502
If one of us dies, we stage it to look

144
00:05:19,504 --> 00:05:21,531
like a suicide caused
by the unjust cancellation

145
00:05:21,531 --> 00:05:22,720
of Firefly.

146
00:05:22,932 --> 00:05:24,903
We're gonna get that show back
on the air, buddy.

147
00:05:26,964 --> 00:05:27,978
How'd it go?

148
00:05:28,314 --> 00:05:29,288
Huh?

149
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:30,315
Oh, fine.

150
00:05:30,317 --> 00:05:31,814
He gave me a check for $10,000

151
00:05:31,814 --> 00:05:33,944
to give to the charity of my choice.

152
00:05:34,228 --> 00:05:35,899
See? He's not messing with us.

153
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:38,124
- Maybe he just hates Shirley.
- What?

154
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,536
Yeah, maybe.

155
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,959
I just need to research a few charities,

156
00:05:41,961 --> 00:05:43,893
because some take a lot off the top

157
00:05:43,894 --> 00:05:45,492
and you think you're giving money to people

158
00:05:45,492 --> 00:05:47,115
that really need it,
and you're really giving it

159
00:05:47,117 --> 00:05:50,956
to some middle man
who's gonna pay off their parking tickets,

160
00:05:50,957 --> 00:05:53,014
credit cards, and keep
from getting kicked out

161
00:05:53,016 --> 00:05:56,159
of her place in... April.

162
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,398
Ah!

163
00:05:57,783 --> 00:05:59,487
He'd like to see Annie next.

164
00:05:59,488 --> 00:06:00,961
You know what? No.

165
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:02,213
He'll see Jeff next.

166
00:06:02,214 --> 00:06:03,483
No, but you're not supposed to go...

167
00:06:03,483 --> 00:06:05,408
Or what? You'll do twice
as much work as a doctor

168
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,735
for half the pay?

169
00:06:07,184 --> 00:06:08,206
Thank you?

170
00:06:08,343 --> 00:06:09,254
It's called a complisult.

171
00:06:09,254 --> 00:06:10,822
Part compliment, part insult.

172
00:06:10,822 --> 00:06:13,589
He invented them. I coined the term.

173
00:06:13,863 --> 00:06:15,177
See what I just did there?

174
00:06:15,177 --> 00:06:16,757
That was an explanabrag.

175
00:06:18,026 --> 00:06:18,690
Hello, Jeffrey.

176
00:06:18,692 --> 00:06:19,689
Pierce.

177
00:06:23,261 --> 00:06:25,125
I've thought about this day many times,

178
00:06:25,127 --> 00:06:27,735
but I've always imagined it differently.

179
00:06:27,735 --> 00:06:29,310
For starters, I thought
you'd be the one in bed

180
00:06:29,312 --> 00:06:31,122
and I'd be a hologram.

181
00:06:31,582 --> 00:06:32,305
What?

182
00:06:32,307 --> 00:06:34,946
Ah, never mind.
There's no time for that now.

183
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,471
Pierce, it's starting to seem,

184
00:06:40,473 --> 00:06:42,055
from observing the others,
that you're using

185
00:06:42,055 --> 00:06:45,112
the social leverage afforded you
by your alleged deathbed

186
00:06:45,112 --> 00:06:47,798
to exact complicated acts
of psychological vengeance

187
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,822
on those closest to you.

188
00:06:48,822 --> 00:06:50,331
Vengeance? Oh, no.

189
00:06:50,331 --> 00:06:52,442
I was never one to hold a grudge, Jeffrey.

190
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,432
My father held grudges.

191
00:06:54,757 --> 00:06:56,250
I'll always hate him for that.

192
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,808
Did you get along with your father?

193
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,014
I got along without him.

194
00:06:59,014 --> 00:07:00,685
Oh, that's no good, Jeffrey.

195
00:07:00,685 --> 00:07:01,651
You don't want your dad to die

196
00:07:01,653 --> 00:07:03,283
before you tell him how you feel.

197
00:07:03,283 --> 00:07:04,014
I'm sure you're right.

198
00:07:04,014 --> 00:07:05,637
Look, let's nip this in the bud.

199
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:08,271
Pierce, we're sorry we didn't respond

200
00:07:08,271 --> 00:07:10,321
quickly enough to your pill addiction.

201
00:07:10,322 --> 00:07:13,572
Is there any chance that apology is enough?

202
00:07:13,774 --> 00:07:16,459
Are you ready to be
bequeathed upon, Jeff?

203
00:07:17,091 --> 00:07:18,052
Yeah.

204
00:07:18,144 --> 00:07:19,276
Blow my mind.

205
00:07:19,913 --> 00:07:21,154
I found your father.

206
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,531
Did you now?

207
00:07:23,584 --> 00:07:27,012
William Winger, born Oklahoma City, 1945.

208
00:07:27,386 --> 00:07:29,685
1974, married Doreen Fitzgerald.

209
00:07:29,685 --> 00:07:31,617
Divorced in 1983.

210
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,512
Most recently residing in Dorchester.

211
00:07:33,514 --> 00:07:36,737
Currently sitting in a town car on its way

212
00:07:36,738 --> 00:07:38,591
to this very hospital.

213
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,699
Should be here in an hour or so,

214
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:42,192
give or take a father.

215
00:07:43,841 --> 00:07:44,752
That it?

216
00:07:44,754 --> 00:07:45,552
Yep.

217
00:07:45,553 --> 00:07:46,447
All right.

218
00:07:46,447 --> 00:07:47,901
See you at the funeral.

219
00:07:50,619 --> 00:07:53,163
And so it is bequeathed.

220
00:08:01,651 --> 00:08:02,968
What are you gonna say to your dad?

221
00:08:03,221 --> 00:08:05,358
I'm not gonna say anything
because I won't have to,

222
00:08:05,358 --> 00:08:07,334
because Pierce is playing
head games with us.

223
00:08:07,336 --> 00:08:08,958
I've decided not to listen to it.

224
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,757
What?

225
00:08:09,757 --> 00:08:12,235
I'm not gonna listen to the CD

226
00:08:12,237 --> 00:08:14,384
of you guys talking about me.

227
00:08:15,964 --> 00:08:16,920
Because I forgive you.

228
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,329
But how do we know
what we're being forgiven for?

229
00:08:19,331 --> 00:08:20,824
We don't even know what's on there.

230
00:08:20,824 --> 00:08:22,422
And you never have to.

231
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,204
Hmm.

232
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:28,365
But what if he is coming, though?

233
00:08:28,367 --> 00:08:29,932
What are you gonna say to him?

234
00:08:30,062 --> 00:08:32,203
Here. I'll be him. I'll be him.

235
00:08:33,392 --> 00:08:34,942
Hi. Hey.

236
00:08:34,943 --> 00:08:36,764
Hi, I'm Jeff's dad. Hi.

237
00:08:36,764 --> 00:08:38,133
Hi. Hi, Jeff's dad.

238
00:08:38,134 --> 00:08:39,095
I'm Britta's dad.

239
00:08:39,096 --> 00:08:40,600
- What? Why?
- I don't know.

240
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,092
Got drunk, didn't have a condom,

241
00:08:42,094 --> 00:08:44,048
and her mom gets freaky
when she hears oingo boingo.

242
00:08:44,048 --> 00:08:45,392
Oh, God, I wish I could relate,

243
00:08:45,393 --> 00:08:47,548
but much like my son,
I'm a closet homosexual.

244
00:08:47,548 --> 00:08:48,804
Don't apologize for that.

245
00:08:48,806 --> 00:08:51,062
You're talking to the guy
that banged Britta's mom.

246
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:52,371
I have no standards.

247
00:08:52,373 --> 00:08:53,653
Well, what do you say we take a tumble?

248
00:08:53,654 --> 00:08:54,474
I'll put on a wig.

249
00:08:54,475 --> 00:08:55,793
That's it. You're under arrest.

250
00:08:55,793 --> 00:08:56,655
I'm an undercover cop.

251
00:08:56,657 --> 00:08:57,985
It's not illegal to be gay.

252
00:08:57,986 --> 00:08:59,294
It is here in Iran.

253
00:08:59,296 --> 00:09:00,398
Not when we're in the green zone.

254
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,575
That's Iraq, stupid.

255
00:09:01,576 --> 00:09:02,307
Well, what do I know?

256
00:09:02,307 --> 00:09:04,591
I'm Jeff Winger's dumb, gay dad.

257
00:09:06,876 --> 00:09:08,854
My father was a two-bit con man

258
00:09:08,855 --> 00:09:11,235
of so little substance
he couldn't leave a trail

259
00:09:11,235 --> 00:09:12,606
if he wanted to.

260
00:09:12,691 --> 00:09:14,777
And I don't care if Pierce
hired Scotland Yard.

261
00:09:14,778 --> 00:09:17,350
He isn't gonna track him down
from a hospital bed.

262
00:09:17,351 --> 00:09:19,565
I mean, money can't just
make people appear.

263
00:09:20,423 --> 00:09:21,421
Excuse me.

264
00:09:21,729 --> 00:09:23,916
I'm looking for Troy Barnes.

265
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,707
Pierce Hawthorne sent me.

266
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,091
Hey, Troy?

267
00:09:35,095 --> 00:09:36,059
Hi.

268
00:09:36,203 --> 00:09:37,413
I'm Levar Burton.

269
00:09:40,409 --> 00:09:43,020
Pierce got Levar Burton
to come here for Troy?

270
00:09:43,336 --> 00:09:45,485
Is there anyone he can't produce?

271
00:09:45,534 --> 00:09:47,155
Now I'm really getting mad.

272
00:09:47,192 --> 00:09:49,567
Why am I the only one
he decided to torture?

273
00:09:56,621 --> 00:09:59,222
I told Pierce a thousand times

274
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:02,350
I never wanted to meet Levar in person!

275
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,628
I just wanted a picture!

276
00:10:04,663 --> 00:10:07,355
You can't disappoint a picture!

277
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,674
I hate you, Pierce!

278
00:10:10,847 --> 00:10:13,229
I hate you so much!

279
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,804
Ahem.

280
00:10:17,967 --> 00:10:19,794
Annie, I forgive you.

281
00:10:20,614 --> 00:10:21,916
Annie Edison.

282
00:10:22,475 --> 00:10:24,212
Your bequeathal is at hand.

283
00:10:25,976 --> 00:10:27,982
Do you have a regular job here?

284
00:10:31,286 --> 00:10:34,139
Annie, I know you're being strong for me.

285
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,355
I give you permission to weep.

286
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:38,803
I'm crying on the inside.

287
00:10:39,325 --> 00:10:39,971
Gross.

288
00:10:39,971 --> 00:10:41,392
Well, in any case,

289
00:10:41,393 --> 00:10:42,774
I want to give you this.

290
00:10:42,774 --> 00:10:45,989
It's been in my family for six generations.

291
00:10:46,552 --> 00:10:47,697
Now it's yours.

292
00:10:49,183 --> 00:10:50,211
Thank you.

293
00:11:08,053 --> 00:11:10,023
Jeff, do you want to see your dad?

294
00:11:10,024 --> 00:11:12,157
- He's not coming.
- But do you want to see him?

295
00:11:12,158 --> 00:11:13,123
No.

296
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:14,986
Then why aren't you leaving?

297
00:11:15,816 --> 00:11:17,378
Because I don't care and I'm not

298
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:19,014
gonna let him think that I care.

299
00:11:19,251 --> 00:11:20,270
Your dad or Pierce?

300
00:11:20,272 --> 00:11:21,411
There is no dad.

301
00:11:21,412 --> 00:11:23,105
And get this thing out of my face!

302
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:24,633
And don't you dare intercut this

303
00:11:24,634 --> 00:11:26,259
with footage of me freaking out.

304
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:31,927
Oh!

305
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:33,753
Is there footage of you freaking out?

306
00:11:34,452 --> 00:11:36,476
Abed, I'm gonna kill you

307
00:11:36,477 --> 00:11:38,005
and Pierce and Britta

308
00:11:38,006 --> 00:11:39,398
and anyone else who thinks I care

309
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:40,915
about any of this!

310
00:11:41,472 --> 00:11:43,836
So do you go to school nearby?

311
00:11:45,963 --> 00:11:48,278
Well, are you more familiar with me

312
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:50,538
from Star Trek or Reading Rainbow?

313
00:11:50,822 --> 00:11:52,399
Reading Rainbow was a show
I hosted and produced

314
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,139
for 25 years on PBS.

315
00:11:54,745 --> 00:11:55,845

What does it mean?

325
00:12:19,129 --> 00:12:20,201
What do you mean "what does it mean"?

326
00:12:20,201 --> 00:12:21,230
No riddles.

327
00:12:21,231 --> 00:12:23,009
You're screwing around with everyone.

328
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:25,061
You gave me a tiara. What does it mean?

329
00:12:25,062 --> 00:12:28,359
Are these... are these blood diamonds?

330
00:12:28,966 --> 00:12:31,344
Are they holocaust diamonds?

331
00:12:31,345 --> 00:12:32,176
No!

332
00:12:32,177 --> 00:12:33,731
Well, what does it mean?

333
00:12:34,415 --> 00:12:36,812
It means you're my favorite.

334
00:12:37,255 --> 00:12:38,870
What does that mean?

335
00:12:39,302 --> 00:12:40,238
I did it.

336
00:12:40,239 --> 00:12:41,649
I gave away the money.

337
00:12:43,006 --> 00:12:44,322
The red cross.

338
00:12:44,863 --> 00:12:46,389
You know what that makes me?

339
00:12:46,453 --> 00:12:47,799
A terrible person.

340
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:49,576
Because if that camera wasn't on me,

341
00:12:49,577 --> 00:12:50,876
I would have taken that money

342
00:12:50,878 --> 00:12:52,576
right out of the mouths of crippled,

343
00:12:52,576 --> 00:12:55,600
starving, malaria-ridden refugee kids

344
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,165
and now I know that forever.

345
00:12:58,542 --> 00:12:59,648
Thanks, Pierce.

346
00:13:01,578 --> 00:13:04,750
Britta, you've got to forgive yourself.

347
00:13:04,946 --> 00:13:05,486
Look at me.

348
00:13:05,488 --> 00:13:07,331
I've forgiven all of you
for the horrible things...

349
00:13:07,331 --> 00:13:09,365
Oh, for crying out loud, Shirley,
give me that CD.

350
00:13:09,365 --> 00:13:10,494
- Oh!
- We're gonna listen to it.

351
00:13:10,495 --> 00:13:11,985
I don't want to listen to it.

352
00:13:11,986 --> 00:13:13,697
Britta, please. Britta.

353
00:13:13,698 --> 00:13:14,960
Britta, wait.

354
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:15,869
Britta!

355
00:13:19,705 --> 00:13:20,682
I'll be right back.

356
00:13:20,683 --> 00:13:22,682
Don't learn anything without me.

357
00:13:23,389 --> 00:13:26,120
So how much do we all hate Shirley?

358
00:13:26,173 --> 00:13:27,278
Pierce, knock it off.

359
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,286
Hey, James Bond, stop trying to record us

360
00:13:29,287 --> 00:13:31,240
with that stupid spy pen.

361
00:13:31,568 --> 00:13:33,043
We can see the blinking light.

362
00:13:33,201 --> 00:13:34,470
Why do you keep trying to record us

363
00:13:34,471 --> 00:13:35,682
bad-mouthing each other?

364
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:37,629
Because he thinks friendship
is a competition

365
00:13:37,629 --> 00:13:39,277
and he's always trying
to get the upper hand.

366
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:41,109
Think Shirley's any different?

367
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,631
- Yes.
- Moron.

368
00:13:42,633 --> 00:13:43,663
Hello!

369
00:13:44,255 --> 00:13:45,980
Guess we do owe you an apology, Shirley.

370
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,161
We shouldn't have said
those things about you.

371
00:13:54,476 --> 00:13:55,664
I guess the lesson here is

372
00:13:55,665 --> 00:13:58,514
that I sometimes use guilt as a weapon.

373
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,489
What are you doing?

374
00:14:00,518 --> 00:14:02,869
Oh, just shooting a talking head

375
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:05,323
or did you want me to be the only one

376
00:14:05,325 --> 00:14:06,947
who didn't have one?

377
00:14:07,886 --> 00:14:08,985
No, go ahead.

378
00:14:10,926 --> 00:14:13,011
I think it stems from when I was...

379
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,553
So you found my father?

380
00:14:18,815 --> 00:14:20,482
Yes, he's on his way.

381
00:14:20,789 --> 00:14:22,725
I mean, if this is too much to handle,

382
00:14:22,726 --> 00:14:25,245
I completely understand
and I can call it off.

383
00:14:25,246 --> 00:14:26,950
Actually, I think I'm ready to see him.

384
00:14:26,951 --> 00:14:29,419
Good. Good for you.

385
00:14:32,014 --> 00:14:34,024
Oh, I should probably tell you...

386
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:37,149
If you're lying to me,
if my father isn't coming,

387
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:39,563
if a car pulls up and
anyone other than my father

388
00:14:39,565 --> 00:14:42,211
steps out...
say, an actor or you in a wig...

389
00:14:42,297 --> 00:14:43,884
If you try to pull any Ferris Bueller,

390
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:46,340
Parent Trap, Three's Company, F/X,

391
00:14:46,341 --> 00:14:48,288
The Deadly Art of Illusion Bull,

392
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:49,967
I will beat you...

393
00:14:50,701 --> 00:14:53,154
And there will be nothing
madcap or wacky about it.

394
00:14:54,148 --> 00:14:55,135
Understood?

395
00:14:55,342 --> 00:14:56,336
Crystal.

396
00:15:10,283 --> 00:15:11,407
- Hi.
- Hey

397
00:15:11,408 --> 00:15:13,234
- I'm Levar.
- Oh, I know.

398
00:15:13,235 --> 00:15:14,799
I was a huge fan of Rebop.

399
00:15:14,801 --> 00:15:16,125
It was cancelled before I was born,

400
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,673
but I scored some VHS copies.

401
00:15:19,254 --> 00:15:21,792
I was nostalgic from a very early age.

402
00:15:21,793 --> 00:15:22,753
Cool.

403
00:15:23,253 --> 00:15:25,825
Hey, you know, I assumed
that Troy was a fan,

404
00:15:25,826 --> 00:15:27,817
but he hasn't said a word
to me since I got here

405
00:15:27,817 --> 00:15:29,828
and now I've got to catch this flight.

406
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:31,227
No! No! You can't go.

407
00:15:31,466 --> 00:15:31,966
He loves you.

408
00:15:31,967 --> 00:15:33,484
He talks about you all the time.

409
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,653
How much would it cost
to change your flight till tomorrow?

410
00:15:36,653 --> 00:15:39,720
Is, um, $261 enough?

411
00:15:39,721 --> 00:15:40,995
'Cause that's all I've got.

412
00:15:40,996 --> 00:15:43,232
- That's all you've got?
- Yeah.

413
00:15:43,701 --> 00:15:46,196
No, you... you keep your money.

414
00:15:46,207 --> 00:15:48,828
I'll... I'll reschedule.

415
00:15:49,095 --> 00:15:49,823
Oh, my God. Thank you.

416
00:15:49,825 --> 00:15:51,525
He's gonna be so happy.

417
00:15:51,727 --> 00:15:54,275
You know, you are a very generous friend,

418
00:15:54,711 --> 00:15:56,580
but you're really stupid with your money.

419
00:16:00,081 --> 00:16:01,344
It's not that I'm selfish.

420
00:16:01,345 --> 00:16:04,043
It's just that I'm really stupid
with my money,

421
00:16:04,044 --> 00:16:06,315
which is why I'll never have a lot of it

422
00:16:06,316 --> 00:16:08,789
and because I'm a really generous friend.

423
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,182
Problem solved.

424
00:16:10,196 --> 00:16:11,666
Dilemma deleted.

425
00:16:11,667 --> 00:16:13,288
Britta for the win!

426
00:16:15,379 --> 00:16:17,330
Oh, thank God he didn't take it.

427
00:16:17,331 --> 00:16:20,463
Could you imagine bouncing
a check to Kunta Kinte?

428
00:16:45,836 --> 00:16:46,710
Hello?

429
00:16:47,129 --> 00:16:49,469
Jeffrey, this is your father.

430
00:16:50,658 --> 00:16:51,710
Uh-huh?

431
00:16:51,736 --> 00:16:53,764
It's me here in this sedan.

432
00:16:54,448 --> 00:16:56,277
See? I'm waving.

433
00:16:57,153 --> 00:17:00,011
I'm sorry I can't come any closer, my boy.

434
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,932
This is too difficult.

435
00:17:01,932 --> 00:17:04,136
You look too much like your mother.

436
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:06,151
No, no. Don't come any closer.

437
00:17:06,152 --> 00:17:07,227
As you were.

438
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:09,453
Well, have to catch a flight to Katmandu,

439
00:17:09,454 --> 00:17:11,357
but I just wanted to say
cherish the new friends

440
00:17:11,358 --> 00:17:12,402
that you've made.

441
00:17:13,573 --> 00:17:15,057
They're your true family now!

442
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:18,809
No! Don't open it!

443
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:20,275
It'll be too hard for both of us!

444
00:17:20,728 --> 00:17:21,845
- Oh, Jeff!
- Jeff!

445
00:17:21,846 --> 00:17:23,696
- Son of a...!
- Oh, no!

446
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:26,449
- Oh!
- Jeff!

447
00:17:26,618 --> 00:17:27,702
No, no, no!

448
00:17:27,738 --> 00:17:29,501
When you improvise a plan,

449
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:31,471
sometimes you hit a speed bump.

450
00:17:31,471 --> 00:17:34,548
And sometimes you hit it so hard

451
00:17:34,664 --> 00:17:36,828
that you soar through the air,

452
00:17:36,953 --> 00:17:39,534
far beyond your initial expectations.

453
00:17:39,952 --> 00:17:41,805
I set out to take revenge on Jeff Winger,

454
00:17:42,513 --> 00:17:44,863
to scare him with the ghost of his father.

455
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,333
Instead, I took over
the role of his father,

456
00:17:48,849 --> 00:17:50,711
and helped make him a better man.

457
00:17:51,232 --> 00:17:53,707
It'll be a long time before Jeff Winger

458
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,688
underestimates me again.

459
00:17:58,066 --> 00:17:58,863
Jeff, no!

460
00:17:58,864 --> 00:18:00,835
Why would you do something like this?

461
00:18:00,836 --> 00:18:02,494
Jeff! Come on, Jeff!

462
00:18:03,788 --> 00:18:06,743
Because I'm sick of you people

463
00:18:06,744 --> 00:18:08,847
not taking me seriously!

464
00:18:09,099 --> 00:18:10,900
You forget my birthday!

465
00:18:10,926 --> 00:18:13,795
You don't invite me
to your Dungeons and Dragons games

466
00:18:13,796 --> 00:18:16,003
or your secret trampoline!

467
00:18:16,853 --> 00:18:19,040
You guys think I'm some kind of a joke!

468
00:18:19,191 --> 00:18:21,497
This isn't disproving the theory!

469
00:18:23,884 --> 00:18:24,770
Good point.

470
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,393
What'd you say? What'd you say?

471
00:18:26,394 --> 00:18:27,557
What did you say?

472
00:18:27,664 --> 00:18:31,021
Apparently I need to say
some things to my father.

473
00:18:31,346 --> 00:18:35,286
Things that I may have screamed
at Pierce instead.

474
00:18:36,145 --> 00:18:38,022
I'm not saying he doesn't deserve it.

475
00:18:39,241 --> 00:18:41,054
But my father deserves it too.

476
00:18:43,034 --> 00:18:44,038
Pierce?

477
00:18:45,517 --> 00:18:46,970
I figured out your test.

478
00:18:47,268 --> 00:18:51,478
Crowns, presents, punishments, favorites.

479
00:18:52,094 --> 00:18:53,306
You're trying to show me the dangers

480
00:18:53,307 --> 00:18:54,806
of my own elitism.

481
00:18:54,961 --> 00:18:57,333
My constant striving to be the best.

482
00:18:57,848 --> 00:19:01,301
So I'm requeathing this tiara.

483
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:03,667
Because if I become the kind of person

484
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:05,727
who thinks it's their place
to pick favorites

485
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:10,114
and torture the rest,
I'll die sad and alone.

486
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:13,247
And that's what you were trying
to teach me.

487
00:19:14,018 --> 00:19:15,252
Very good, Annie.

488
00:19:15,816 --> 00:19:16,961
You pass.

489
00:19:22,856 --> 00:19:25,054
She's actually just my favorite.

490
00:19:29,594 --> 00:19:31,191
So I thought the documentary format

491
00:19:31,192 --> 00:19:32,715
would be like fish in a barrel,

492
00:19:32,717 --> 00:19:35,401
but as is the case
with a real barrel of fish,

493
00:19:35,402 --> 00:19:36,797
after a while, it can become cramped,

494
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:38,291
chaotic, and stinky.

495
00:19:38,638 --> 00:19:40,395
In their floor and bats...

496
00:19:40,396 --> 00:19:42,290
Fortunately, if in the end,
your documentary is turning out

497
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:43,986
just as messy as real life,

498
00:19:44,388 --> 00:19:45,670
you can always wrap it up with a series

499
00:19:45,671 --> 00:19:46,970
of random shots, which when cut together

500
00:19:46,971 --> 00:19:48,787
under a generic voice-over,

501
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:51,512
suggest a profound thematic connection.

502
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,405
I'm not knocking it.

503
00:19:54,638 --> 00:19:55,671
It works.

504
00:19:56,538 --> 00:19:57,511
Guys.

505
00:20:03,387 --> 00:20:04,357
Oh.

506
00:20:04,843 --> 00:20:05,965
Aww.

507
00:20:09,362 --> 00:20:10,959
Jeff and I became...

508
00:20:11,531 --> 00:20:13,704
Kind of like father and son today.

509
00:20:14,682 --> 00:20:16,055
No, we did not.

510
00:20:20,073 --> 00:20:21,181
Troy, I am telling you, man,

511
00:20:21,182 --> 00:20:22,835
this salmon is really good.

512
00:20:26,527 --> 00:20:28,330
Would you mind passing me the pepper?

513
00:20:34,584 --> 00:20:37,067

514

Well, more fish for Kunta.
