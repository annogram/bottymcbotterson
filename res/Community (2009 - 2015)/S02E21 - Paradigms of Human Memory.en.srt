and shove it up its own ass?

320
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:20,051
He's not being meta.

321
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,320
He's just pointing out what
none of us want to acknowledge--

322
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:23,321
It's all of us.

323
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:24,923
This group is toxic.

324
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:26,958
We fight about fighting
about fighting.

325
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:28,660
- We're sick.
- I hate us!

326
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:30,228
Well, what do we do now?

327
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,130
Well, we could do
what we always do--

328
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:35,266
Storm out in a huff and say
that the group is breaking up.

329
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:50,014
Troy, pass me
that paintbrush, please.

[Clattering]

331
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:06,364
Does anybody have any iodine?

332
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:09,767
How many vents are you
gonna crawl out of this year?

333
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:17,308
That's it.
We're done.

334
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:20,178
Yeah. We're done.

335
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:22,347
See you all tomorrow.

336
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:24,716
Uh, you guys, wait.
I want to say something.

337
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,651
You don't have to save us
with a speech.

338
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:27,752
We're not breaking up,

339
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:29,487
so we don't need to get
back together.

340
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:31,723
I know I don't have to,
but I want to.

341
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:35,994
Look, we've known each other
for almost two years now.

342
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:37,595
And, yeah, in that time,

343
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:39,497
I've given a lot of speeches,

344
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:41,933
but they all have
one thing in common.

345
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:44,469
They're all different.

346
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,537
These drug runners
aren't gonna execute Pierce

347
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:47,772
because he's racist.

348
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:50,742
It's a locomotive
that runs on us.

349
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:53,177
And the only sharks
in that water

350
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:57,248
are the emotional ghosts
that I like to call fear.

351
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:59,517
Anchovies. Fear.

352
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:02,587
And the dangers
of ingesting mercury.

353
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:06,457
Because the real bugs
aren't the ones in those beds.

354
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:09,494
And there's no such thing
as a free Caesar salad.

355
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,695
And even if there were...

356
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:12,597
<i>The Cape</i> still might find

357
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:14,499
a second life on cable.

358
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:15,967
And I'll tell you why.

359
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:18,436
<i>El corazon del agua es verdad.</i>

360
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,938
That water is a lie!

361
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,041
Harrison Ford
is irradiating our testicles

362
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,976
with microwave
satellite transmissions!

363
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:27,211
So maybe we are caught
in an endless cycle

364
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:29,347
of screwups and hurt feelings,

365
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:32,350
but I choose to believe
it's just the universe's way

366
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:35,286
of molding us
into some kind of supergroup.

367
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,821
Like the Traveling Wilburys.

368
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:40,391
Yes, Troy, like
the Traveling Wilburys of pain--

369
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:43,694
Prepared for any insane
adventure life throws our way.

370
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,196
And I don't know about you,

371
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,598
but I'm looking forward
to every one of them.

372
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:48,966
Oh, Jeffrey.

373
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,335
Oh, Jeff.

00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,573
Jeffrey, Jeffrey.

375
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:58,576
Well, I guess
we can get through anything.

376
00:17:58,610 --> 00:17:59,911
So it's probably okay

377
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:02,647
if you and Britta want to keep,
you know, hooking up.

- I'm cool with it.

379
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,984

- Whatever.

380
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:09,787
Have fun tonight.

381
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:11,789
So...

382
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:15,093
I guess we don't have to keep
sneaking around anymore.

383
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:16,828
Yeah, I guess not.

384
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:21,232
Both:
You want to stop doing this?

385
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,101
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

386
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:24,869
- It's not you, it's me.
- It's you.

I care about you guys.

404
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:22,860
Shut up, dean.
You dress in stupid outfits.

405
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:25,563
Well, you have a right
to your opinion,

406
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:27,598
so I'll just leave.

407
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:29,667
You could have been nicer
to the dean just then, Jeff.

408
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:31,369
So what?
I don't care.

409
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:34,672
I just think there maybe
could be repercussions, yo.

I don't care what you think.

411

I don't care
about repercussions.

412
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:39,443
And I don't care
about the dean.

413
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:41,612
Okay.

414
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:43,948
Meanwhile, at that same moment,

415
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:48,352
a truck full of toxic waste
crashes and spills on the dean,

416

transforming him
into Mega-dean!

417
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:54,425
I don't care about anything.

00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:10,174
Wait. I care now!
Now I care!

419

He's entitled
to a modicum of respect.

422
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,856
You're always
so mean to him. Why?

423
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,425
It's embarrassing to admit,

424
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:30,828
but sometimes I felt jealous
of his interesting outfits.

425

Jeffrey,
if I didn't know better,

00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:36,033
I'd say you had a crush on him.
