2
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:20,311
My name is Kevin.
Or so they tell me.

3
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:24,106
Actually, they told me my birth name is
Benjamin Chang...

4
00:00:24,398 --> 00:00:26,900
but I can't remember anything
before six months ago.

5
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:30,571
But by using a special shiny glass
called a mirror...

6
00:00:30,863 --> 00:00:35,284
I've estimated that I'm 15 years old,
although I have no way of knowing.

7
00:00:35,993 --> 00:00:38,912
Changnesia is a fascinating
and extremely rare disease...

8
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:41,665
on the forefront of
the psychological landscape.

9
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:43,834
Compared with
your garden-variety amnesia...

10
00:00:44,126 --> 00:00:46,628
Changnesia is immeasurably
more complex.

11
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:51,425
Its varied and seemingly
random symptoms...

12
00:00:51,717 --> 00:00:54,886
its resistance to both traditional
and new age medicine.

13
00:00:55,179 --> 00:00:58,891
Why Changnesia affects the memory
but not the ability to make forced puns.

14
00:00:59,433 --> 00:01:02,144
These are all things we can study
now that someone has it.

15
00:01:02,853 --> 00:01:06,147
I first met Chang when I hired him
as a Spanish teacher at Greendale.

16
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,652
Then he became a disgraced student,
a psychopathic music major...

17
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:13,489
a homeless vent dweller,
security guard, keytarist...

18
00:01:13,781 --> 00:01:16,241
power-hungry warlord,
and now Kevin.

19
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,827
It's sad to see him like this.
Well, it's mixed.

20
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,412
He was pretty terrible before.

21
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:23,290
I'm developing a theory
which some find controversial.

22
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,626
Perhaps Chang actually
used to be Kevin...

23
00:01:25,918 --> 00:01:27,461
went crazy, and became Chang.

24
00:01:27,753 --> 00:01:31,173
And then at some point,
Chang hit his head, went un-crazy...

25
00:01:31,465 --> 00:01:34,593
thereby reverting back
to regular old Kevin again.

26
00:01:34,885 --> 00:01:36,761
That makes no sense.

27
00:01:37,054 --> 00:01:40,474
Science tells us hitting his head
would only cure him...

28
00:01:40,766 --> 00:01:43,018
if hitting his head
was the original cause.

29
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:44,770
I told you it was controversial.

30
00:01:45,062 --> 00:01:46,938
Here at Greendale,
we accept all students...

31
00:01:47,231 --> 00:01:49,775
whoever they may be
or have forgotten they were.

32
00:01:50,067 --> 00:01:53,862
But assisting in Kevin's recovery has
put a financial strain on the school.

33
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:55,614
That's why we are appealing...

34
00:01:55,906 --> 00:01:59,284
to the MacGuffin Neurological
Institute for this $40,000 grant...

35
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:02,580
so we can continue to fight
this terrible disease...

36
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:06,292
and hopefully, one day,
pay for this documentary.

37
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:08,919
How was that, Abed? It's too beggy?

38
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:10,211
No, that was great.

39
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:12,756
But I could use a new camera
with a smoother zoom.

40
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:15,217
Okay. Just be sure
to get my good side.

41
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:17,219
This documentary needs
to be convincing.

42
00:02:17,511 --> 00:02:20,889
This needs to be the Hoop Dreams
of things people care about.

43
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,600
We rolling?

44
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:28,230
Dean wants propaganda but I intend to
explore all sides of this serious issue...

45
00:02:28,522 --> 00:02:30,982
including those who don't think
it's a serious issue.

46
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,152
- Hey, Jeff.
- What are you doing?

47
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:36,238
- A documentary on Changnesia.
- You gotta be ♪♪♪♪♪♪♪ kidding me.

48
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:39,324
Got it. Beautiful.
All right, let's get one more for safety.

49
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:41,702
Jeff, back to one. Jeff?

50
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,623

00:02:49,293 --> 00:02:52,129

56
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:11,065
I'm telling you, we should have sprung
for the name-brand glitter.

57
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:15,319
Look, cheap glitter, expensive glitter.
Money talks, people.

58
00:03:15,611 --> 00:03:16,611
Guys, did you hear?

59
00:03:16,862 --> 00:03:19,531
The History of Ice Cream class
had another heart attack.

60
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:22,034
- Three more and we're all in.
- Yes.

61
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,662
What's the MacGuffin Institute?

62
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:27,873
Fine. I'll tell him.

63
00:03:28,165 --> 00:03:31,585
But one day, you'll all be old
and slow and lose at things...

64
00:03:31,877 --> 00:03:34,963
and when that day comes,
I won't remember what I'm doing now.

65
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,300
The MacGuffin Institute is coming
to Greendale...

66
00:03:38,592 --> 00:03:41,720
because they might give the school
money to study Changnesia.

67
00:03:42,012 --> 00:03:44,556
Changnesia isn't a disease.
It's a con.

68
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:48,477
You're seriously helping this lunatic?
He kept the dean in a dungeon.

69
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:51,438
He tried to kill us.
He ate his twin in utero.

70
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:55,067
- That was Chang. This is Kevin.
- They're the same idiot.

71
00:03:55,359 --> 00:03:57,736
How would you know?
Have you ever spent time with him?

72
00:03:58,028 --> 00:04:00,196
I was reluctant to accept Kevin
at first too...

73
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:05,619
but he's just so sweet.
The world is brand new to him.

74
00:04:05,911 --> 00:04:09,706
He approaches everything with
the wonder of a child or cartoon alien.

75
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:14,836
- This makes things smaller.
- No, bigger.

76
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:16,922
Oh, bigger.

77
00:04:17,214 --> 00:04:19,216
Well, enjoy your collective delusion.

78
00:04:19,508 --> 00:04:23,178
I'm gonna go get a sandwich,
which, unlike Changnesia, is real.

79
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,389
Jeff, wait.
We wanna know how you feel...

80
00:04:25,681 --> 00:04:27,432
about the MacGuffin people
visiting.

81
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:28,725
- It's stupid.
- What?

82
00:04:28,934 --> 00:04:30,810
- The whole thing.
- Put it together for me.

83
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:33,355
All right. Thanks, buddy.
I'll cut it together.

84
00:04:35,649 --> 00:04:36,649
Shirley.

85
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:38,611
You don't seriously think
Chang is Kevin?

86
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:41,363
I believe the Lord made Chang,
Chang. Kevin is a choice.

87
00:04:41,655 --> 00:04:43,114
I'm worried about the group.

88
00:04:43,407 --> 00:04:45,367
Not only have they drunk
the Kevin Kool-Aid...

89
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:48,453
they're in the study room,
making banners, debating glitter.

90
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:50,539
I'd love to talk but I gotta get to work.

91
00:04:50,831 --> 00:04:52,874
No, Shirley,
you've got to help me stop this.

92
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:54,877
You're the only sane person left.

93
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:58,630
Welcome to Shirley's Sandwiches,
where the food is Kevin-ly.

94
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,132
You hired Chang?

95
00:05:00,424 --> 00:05:03,301
The customers love Kevin.
It's because he's a good listener.

96
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,971
Most words are new to him,
so it's still fascinating.

97
00:05:06,263 --> 00:05:09,474
- I'm Kevin. And you are...?
- Not calling you Kevin.

98
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:13,312
Hi, Not-Calling-You-Kevin.
What are you having?

99
00:05:14,438 --> 00:05:16,398
- None of this.
- Okay.

100
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:19,984
Listen. I don't care what he calls
himself, he's a hard worker.

101
00:05:20,277 --> 00:05:23,571
We're all broken people, Jeffrey.
We all deserve a second chance.

102
00:05:23,864 --> 00:05:27,075
Like I gave Andre a second chance.
Doesn't mean I forgot. I just forgave.

103
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:30,079
Chang didn't sleep with a stripper.
He tried to kill us.

104
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,664
- Why does everyone forget that?
- But he didn't.

105
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:34,792
And you used to be a sleazy lawyer.

106
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:37,586
What if Greendale never gave you
a second chance?

107
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,756
What Shirley said
really made me think.

108
00:05:41,048 --> 00:05:43,675
I mean, all my friends believe
this guy.

109
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:46,428
What does it say about me
that I don't?

110
00:05:47,596 --> 00:05:49,139
Yes?

111
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:53,727
And cue Wet Blanket Winger to tell us
that we're all wasting our time.

112
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:55,520
Actually, no.

113
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:57,898
I had a really good conversation
with Shirley...

114
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,192
and I realised
I've been acting like a jerk.

115
00:06:00,484 --> 00:06:03,528
If it's not too late,
I'd love to help out in any way I can.

116
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:05,948
Jeffrey, that's amazing.
I knew you'd come around.

117
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,699
Abed, get us in panning singles.

118
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:10,953
Can you say "powwow" instead
of "conversation"? It sounds more you.

119
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:13,205
Action. You gonna make an entrance?
Great.

120
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:15,749
What does it say?

121
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:19,044
It says I have gullible friends
who will believe anybody...

122
00:06:19,336 --> 00:06:21,880
and I need to make
that anybody me...

123
00:06:22,172 --> 00:06:24,799
by exposing Chang
in front of the whole school.

124
00:06:25,092 --> 00:06:27,844
Much like the classic documentary
Capturing the Friedmans...

125
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,180
my story took a completely
unexpected turn.

126
00:06:30,472 --> 00:06:33,391
Jeff, if you want this done right,
I need a Steadicam for Garrett.

127
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:35,686
That's showbiz.

128
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,692
We were all pretty happy
when Jeff came around.

129
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:44,403
He became really gung ho
about Abed's documentary...

130
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:47,280
and had ideas about how to impress
the MacGuffin people.

131
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:51,243
And that's why Pierce should host
the reception.

132
00:06:51,535 --> 00:06:52,661
He speaks their language.

133
00:06:52,953 --> 00:06:54,996
Finally, somebody's making
some sense.

134
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:59,084
I've got a blackface Senor Wences bit
I've been workshopping.

135
00:06:59,376 --> 00:07:02,087
Perfect. Annie, we need to find out
what happened to Kevin...

136
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:03,880
before he showed up
at Greendale.

137
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:07,217
What hellish experiences did
he overcome during those months?

138
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:10,595
You think you can use your forensic
know-how to do some investigating?

139
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:14,099
- Investigating? Obvi.
- Can I help?

140
00:07:14,391 --> 00:07:16,226
If you're willing to learn,
sure, partner.

141
00:07:16,518 --> 00:07:18,436
Partner. I like that.

142
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:21,898
I'm gonna call you Houlihan.
Partner and Houlihan.

143
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:23,483
Okay.

144
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:26,153
The postman found Kevin here.

145
00:07:26,445 --> 00:07:28,864
He said he was soaking wet
and smelled like fish.

146
00:07:29,156 --> 00:07:32,284
- I know it's not a lot to go on...
- It's almost too much to go on.

147
00:07:32,576 --> 00:07:35,787
Look, Sullivan's Trout Farm
is just quarter mile away.

148
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,124
- Who do you think you're dealing with?
- I don't know. Seems thin.

149
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:42,961
In an investigation, one dude always
has to go opposite the other dude.

150
00:07:43,253 --> 00:07:45,713
- That's how they get things done.
- You guys work it out.

151
00:07:46,006 --> 00:07:48,967
- Yeah, we will.
- No, we won't.

152
00:07:49,718 --> 00:07:51,136
- Britta, Shirley.
- That's me.

153
00:07:51,428 --> 00:07:54,764
I want you to take this camera and
follow Chang around for his day-to-day.

154
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:57,726
Really get into the life of
a functioning Changnesiac.

155
00:07:58,018 --> 00:08:02,022
I want you to go inside his home,
work, pod. Just get everything.

156
00:08:02,314 --> 00:08:04,482
That's great advertising for
my growing business.

157
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:07,152
Okay, I'll do it.
And with my photography skills...

158
00:08:07,444 --> 00:08:09,154
Jeff, thank you.

159
00:08:09,446 --> 00:08:12,490
When the dean told me you were
gonna help me, I couldn't believe it.

160
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:16,787
A cool, smart lawyer like yourself
reaching out to a little nobody like me?

161
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,164
I never told you I was a lawyer.

162
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,460
No, you didn't.
Shirley said it, remember?

163
00:08:23,752 --> 00:08:26,254
You said, "You hired Chang?"
I said, "Kevin. You are...?"

164
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,924
"Not calling you Kevin."
"Hi. What are you having?"

165
00:08:29,216 --> 00:08:30,300
You said, "None of this."

166
00:08:30,592 --> 00:08:33,678
Shirley said, "I don't care what
he calls himself. He's a hard worker."

167
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,514
We all deserve a second chance.

168
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:39,142
"Like I gave Andre a second chance.
Doesn't mean I forgot. I just forgave."

169
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:42,354
You said, "Chang didn't sleep
with a stripper. He tried to kill us."

170
00:08:42,646 --> 00:08:44,022
Why does everyone forget that?"

171
00:08:44,314 --> 00:08:48,443
And then Shirley said, "But he didn't.
And you used to be a sleazy lawyer."

172
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,028
Her words.

173
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:52,197
That's quite a memory you have.

174
00:08:52,489 --> 00:08:54,491
My short-term memory
has actually improved.

175
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:57,660
My doctor calls it a...

176
00:08:59,496 --> 00:09:00,872
side effect.

177
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:05,294
Well played, Chang.
The chess match has begun.

178
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:07,546
What...? I'm Chinese?

179
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:10,048
Do you wanna get footage
while we wait for Kevin?

180
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,842
Maybe we could take shots
of my delicious bread baking...

181
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:14,886
or the affordable prices
on our new...

182
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:17,097
Shirley's Sandwiches
Super Saver Menu.

183
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:20,642
Or we could get to know the Shirley
behind the sandwiches.

184
00:09:20,934 --> 00:09:22,602
- Here, give me that camera.
- Okay.

185
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,105
- Be careful now. It's Abed's camera.
- All right.

186
00:09:25,397 --> 00:09:29,776
- Watch it.
- Oh, where is the stop button on this?

187
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,863
Oh, here it is.
Okay. You wanna hear my pitch?

188
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:36,908
A strong, independent woman,
starting her own business.

189
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,620
An entrepreneu-her, if you will.

190
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:43,415
- Or maybe a businesswoman?
- Okay, fine. Think inside the box.

191
00:09:43,707 --> 00:09:46,876
All right. Are you ready? Action.

192
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,506
Cut. Beautiful.

193
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,175
You think the song was too much?

194
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:55,594
Are you kidding me?
It made the scene.

195
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:58,221
I wanna get some better lighting
up in this noise.

196
00:09:58,514 --> 00:09:59,681
Let's go hit up Abed.

197
00:09:59,973 --> 00:10:03,393
- I never told anybody that story, Britta.
- It was beautiful.

198
00:10:03,685 --> 00:10:06,688
- I was dead for three minutes.
- Three minutes?

199
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,940
Three whole minutes.
They thought I was gone.

200
00:10:09,733 --> 00:10:13,194
- Pierce, how's your act coming?
- Blackface Senor Wences?

201
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:16,030
How do you think it's coming?

202
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:21,036
In the unlikely event
I fail to expose Chang...

203
00:10:21,328 --> 00:10:24,039
I'm confident Pierce will make sure
we don't get a grant.

204
00:10:24,331 --> 00:10:26,458
What you talking about, honky?

205
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,793
That bit could not get
any more perfect.

206
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:33,586
Wait a minute. I haven't introduced you
to my Asian wife yet.

207
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:37,385
I was wrong.

208
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:43,809
- This is the place.
- No, it's not.

209
00:10:46,645 --> 00:10:48,605
- Garrett, here he comes. Get up.
- I can't.

210
00:10:48,897 --> 00:10:52,025
- It's too heavy.
- Garrett, now. Now.

211
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:57,656
Excuse me, Mr. Sullivan. This is
Houlihan. I'm her partner, Partner.

212
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:00,450
- Wait, I'm Partner.
- No, you're not.

213
00:11:01,201 --> 00:11:04,120
- We'd like to ask a couple questions.
- What are you, trout police?

214
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:07,165
If you are, you're legally bound
to tell me or it's entrapment.

215
00:11:07,457 --> 00:11:11,335
We're not the trout police.
Have you seen this man?

216
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,120
One morning I see something
come out of the trout tank...

217
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:17,133
and at first I was scared...

218
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:20,345
because I'm the last face
that a lot of trout ever see.

219
00:11:20,637 --> 00:11:23,264
I'm not saying
that the trout are a vengeful breed...

220
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:27,936
but if they were, I'd probably be
public enemy number one.

221
00:11:28,228 --> 00:11:30,688
So the figure that emerged,
it was that man?

222
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:33,858
Yeah. I was relieved when I found out
it was a naked Asian guy...

223
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,486
- and not an angry trout.
- And when was this?

224
00:11:36,778 --> 00:11:38,613
It must have been around June.

225
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,782
I remember
because my milkweed allergies...

226
00:11:41,074 --> 00:11:42,700
were acting up something fierce.

227
00:11:43,118 --> 00:11:44,369
I gave him some clothes...

228
00:11:44,661 --> 00:11:48,039
sent him on his way the next morning.
I don't know what happened to him.

229
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:51,001
Mr. Sullivan, how many employees
do you have here?

230
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,878
Employees?
What do I look like, TroutWorld?

231
00:11:55,422 --> 00:11:59,384
No employees. Just me and my dog.

232
00:11:59,968 --> 00:12:01,344
I knew he was hiding something.

233
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:05,474
A spike in production in June at
the peak of milkweed allergy season?

234
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:09,853
Something on this trout farm
was starting to smell wrong.

235
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:13,106
The problem was,
I didn't have any way to make him talk.

236
00:12:13,398 --> 00:12:14,482
Or did I?

237
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:18,653
Well, looks like everything checks
out here. Right, Troy?

238
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:21,657
No, Houlihan,
I don't think anything checks out here.

239
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:24,284
No, don't fly off the handle, Partner.

240
00:12:24,576 --> 00:12:26,744
Oh, I will fly off the handle,
Houlihan.

241
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:29,831
- What the hell are you talking about?
- I'm sorry.

242
00:12:30,123 --> 00:12:32,583
Clearly, you have nothing to hide.

243
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:36,880
- What are you hiding?
- Fine. You got me.

244
00:12:37,172 --> 00:12:39,424
I'd been using that Asian guy
as unpaid labour...

245
00:12:39,716 --> 00:12:42,385
for three months
before I drove him into town.

246
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,763
But he wanted me to!

247
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:49,555
We were friends and I treated him
with respect and dignity.

248
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:52,854
Partner and Houlihan.

249
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:54,814
Shut up, Kevin!

250
00:12:55,315 --> 00:12:57,734
Partner and Houlihan.

251
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:00,487
I don't understand.
Why work for no money?

252
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:04,115
He doesn't know about money,
labour laws or 40-hour work weeks...

253
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,034
or that dude named him
after a dog.

254
00:13:06,326 --> 00:13:08,411
I had a cat named Troy,
a bird named Troy...

255
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:10,372
and a hamster named Troy.

256
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:12,624
They were all older than me.

257
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:14,542
Oh, my God.

258
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:18,421
I think Kevin's struggle
just got a lot sexier, grant-wise.

259
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:20,757
This is horrible.

260
00:13:21,049 --> 00:13:24,343
It was horrible. They were supposed
to come back with a smoking gun.

261
00:13:24,636 --> 00:13:28,139
All they found was a little human rights
abuse. Which, normally, is terrible.

262
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:31,309
- So do you believe Kevin now?
- No. I want all your footage.

263
00:13:31,601 --> 00:13:32,727
I know Chang slipped up.

264
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,147
He's not smart enough
to play dumb all the time.

265
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:36,690
Shirley and Britta's footage?

266
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,150
- It's unusable crap.
- I don't care. I want it all.

267
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,945
Bad enough to rent a crane
and licence an expensive song?

268
00:13:42,237 --> 00:13:43,237
Yeah. Whatever.

269
00:13:53,915 --> 00:13:56,167
"Unusable crap" is generous.

270
00:13:57,085 --> 00:13:58,336
It goes on for 12 hours.

271
00:13:58,628 --> 00:14:02,173
I couldn't even get through it all
and I sat through The Tree of Life.

272
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,677
Wait, right there. What's that?

273
00:14:06,928 --> 00:14:09,347
Oh, come on, you slippery snake,
slip up.

274
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:12,308
Doubtful. When alone,
he just practises smiling and frowning.

275
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,019
We've all done it.

276
00:14:22,652 --> 00:14:25,905
- Who's he calling?
- Good question.

277
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,618
We figure that out,
we've got our smoking gun.

278
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,537
- And all thanks to Britta.
- Don't ruin this.

279
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,333
The stage was set for a climatic
final set piece.

280
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,545
The MacGuffin people were on campus.
Jeff prepared quite the presentation.

281
00:14:40,837 --> 00:14:43,297
And I didn't urinate on a...
You shut up.

282
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,590
But I love you.

283
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,551
You get in the kitchen,
make me a burrito.

284
00:14:46,843 --> 00:14:48,803
Oh, okay. Oh, thank you.

285
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:51,056
Okay, thank you,
Pierce Hawthorne...

286
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:54,559
for your special blend of playful
racial humour...

287
00:14:54,851 --> 00:14:57,228
and genuine thoughts on
Geraldine Ferraro.

288
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,022
He's an old teddy bear.

289
00:14:59,314 --> 00:15:03,151
And now, I believe, Jeff Winger
has a presentation.

290
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:07,030
Thank you. I must confess...

291
00:15:07,322 --> 00:15:11,659
I was, just a short while ago,
quite skeptical about Changnesia.

292
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:14,621
With the help of my friends,
we have uncovered a lot about...

293
00:15:14,913 --> 00:15:18,583
this terrible, newly discovered,
completely real disease.

294
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:21,586
I think you'll find it as eye-opening
as I did.

295
00:15:21,878 --> 00:15:23,254
Wait till you see what we found.

296
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,757
Kevin was a victim
of human trafficking.

297
00:15:26,049 --> 00:15:30,549
Our purpose here tonight is
to help cure Kevin of his Changnesia.

298
00:15:31,721 --> 00:15:33,431
Who better to jog his memory...

299
00:15:33,723 --> 00:15:36,892
than someone special
from his allegedly-erased past.

300
00:15:37,185 --> 00:15:38,728
So please welcome to the stage...

301
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:42,273
the former Mrs. Ben Chang,
Alessandra.

302
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:45,360
- Alessandra, come on up.
- Thank you.

303
00:15:49,739 --> 00:15:52,533
Ben, do you remember me?

304
00:15:55,495 --> 00:15:57,205
I'm sorry.

305
00:15:58,415 --> 00:15:59,415
I don't.

306
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:02,001
Admit it, Kevin. You remember her.

307
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:05,088
This is the woman you never
stopped loving.

308
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,381
Hit the lights!

309
00:16:19,644 --> 00:16:21,604
You love her so much...

310
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:25,567
you called her over and over
and over again...

311
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:28,152
though you don't know her
or how to use a phone...

312
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:30,822
or what a number is.

313
00:16:32,115 --> 00:16:34,992
What's going on here?
You told me I was here to help him.

314
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:37,328
Oh, we are here to help him, all right.

315
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:42,121
We are here to help him admit that
he has been faking this whole time.

316
00:16:42,417 --> 00:16:45,962
- Where'd you get the number, Chang?
- I found it in the vents.

317
00:16:46,838 --> 00:16:49,632
It's 555-0190.

318
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,677
And it was the most beautiful thing
I'd ever seen.

319
00:16:53,428 --> 00:16:56,556
But I always hung up
because I didn't know...

320
00:16:56,848 --> 00:17:00,142
if the person on the other end
would ever want to talk to Kevin...

321
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:01,811
after knowing Chang.

322
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:03,980
You seem so nice.

323
00:17:04,272 --> 00:17:06,065
If we were really married...

324
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:09,277
I wish I could remember for even
one moment how lucky I was.

325
00:17:10,862 --> 00:17:11,862
Oh, Ben.

326
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:16,826
Jeffrey, what are you doing?

327
00:17:17,118 --> 00:17:20,121
If he doesn't remember her,
then this wouldn't bother him.

328
00:17:20,413 --> 00:17:22,331
My logic is flawless.

329
00:17:24,292 --> 00:17:26,335
Doesn't that bother you?
That bothers you.

330
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:29,047
Things got so ugly,
I hesitate to show you this footage.

331
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:30,965
I will let you see me reacting to it.

332
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,343
That'll probably be more
than you can handle.

333
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:43,061
Actually, it's not that bad
but this keeps the story moving.

334
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:47,648
Hey, Alessandra, his last girlfriend
was a charred mannequin leg!

335
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:50,902
- Jeffrey, have you lost your mind?
- You never believed Kevin?

336
00:17:51,194 --> 00:17:53,821
You were lying to manipulate us
into helping you hurt him?

337
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,907
Jeffrey, I trusted you,
believed in you...

338
00:17:56,199 --> 00:17:58,701
fantasised about celebrating
over mimosas with you.

339
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:03,331
If this is the sort of battle you're facing
in the fight against Changnesia...

340
00:18:03,623 --> 00:18:06,000
then you're gonna need
all the help you can get.

341
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:09,504
On behalf of the MacGuffin
Neurological Institute, grant granted.

342
00:18:10,505 --> 00:18:12,256
- Granted?
- That's nice.

343
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,842
- Partner and Houlihan.
- Jeffrey.

344
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:18,930
So I guess I did help.
Just not in the way I wanted to.

345
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:23,351
But on the bright side, this is the most
well-documented failure of my life.

346
00:18:27,647 --> 00:18:28,731
- Thank you.
- I know.

347
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,942
By trying to make Kevin a pariah...

348
00:18:31,234 --> 00:18:34,904
I accidentally became more
Chang than Chang at his Changiest.

349
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:37,699
That's funny.

350
00:18:38,241 --> 00:18:40,034
Well, I didn't try to kill anyone.

351
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:43,580
Which no one seems to care about,
but you know what I'm saying.

352
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:46,624
Can I sit here?

353
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,087
You sure you wanna be seen
with me?

354
00:18:51,379 --> 00:18:53,964
You have a brand-new reputation
to uphold.

355
00:18:55,383 --> 00:18:57,760
- I like you.
- Really?

356
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:02,553
Even after everything I did to
whoever you are?

357
00:19:02,974 --> 00:19:06,227
Okay, I get it.
Changnesia's hard to understand.

358
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:08,187
At least, that's what people tell me.

359
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,816
I don't know a thing about it, which,
apparently, is one of the symptoms...

360
00:19:12,108 --> 00:19:14,068
and it's so frustrating.

361
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:19,157
Look, I know Chang was a bad guy.

362
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:23,161
So he probably deserved everything
you did to him.

363
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:27,039
But you're not a bad guy,
you just made a mistake.

364
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:31,002
And I'm willing to start over fresh
if you are.

365
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:35,506
Hi. My name's Kevin.

366
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:39,177
I'm not saying I believe him...

367
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:43,347
but I have gotten an idea
of what it feels like to be Chang.

368
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,352
Wanting to leave that name behind is
the sanest decision anyone can make.

369
00:19:53,316 --> 00:19:56,193
Hi. I'm Jeff.

370
00:20:09,457 --> 00:20:12,293
Thanks. A lot of filmmakers use
crane shots to elicit emotion.

371
00:20:12,585 --> 00:20:13,585
What the heck, Abed?

372
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:16,130
You knew what Jeffrey was planning
the whole time?

373
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:19,676
Why can't you make a documentary
about the thing you plan to?

374
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:22,720
Don't censor him. Censorship.

375
00:20:23,012 --> 00:20:24,138
This is the documentary.

376
00:20:25,306 --> 00:20:27,891
Abed, you gotta teach me
how to use that camera.

377
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:33,856
Guys, I'm sorry.
I really screwed up.

378
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,900
I hope you can forgive me.

379
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,276
Already forgotten.

380
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:41,239
- Kevin.
- What we laughing about?

381
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:42,907
- Oh, Kevin.
- Kevin.

382
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:45,535
- Adorable.
- Good job.

383
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:46,827
I don't get it.

384
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,175
Hi, it's me.

385
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:05,263
They all finally bought it.
Hook, line and Winger.

386
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:07,682
I patiently await
your further instructions.

387
00:21:07,974 --> 00:21:10,226
Chang out.

388
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:16,316
Why did I do that?

388
00:21:17,305 --> 00:21:23,694
