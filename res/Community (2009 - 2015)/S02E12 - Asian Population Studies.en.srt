1
00:00:09,063 --> 00:00:10,770
- Da-da-doom.
- Ba-dip ba.

2
00:00:11,283 --> 00:00:11,994
Did everyone have a good break?

3
00:00:11,995 --> 00:00:13,440
Yeah, I discovered
a new back muscle

4
00:00:13,441 --> 00:00:14,500
to work out.

5
00:00:14,501 --> 00:00:17,303
Ladies, you'll thank me
come tank top season.

6
00:00:17,304 --> 00:00:18,656
I checked all of
Pierce's wardrobes

7
00:00:18,657 --> 00:00:20,244
for portals to magical worlds.

8
00:00:20,245 --> 00:00:22,483
All I found was something
called Emmanuelle in Space

9
00:00:22,484 --> 00:00:24,036
on laserdisc...
I couldn't watch it,

10
00:00:24,037 --> 00:00:25,989
but it sounded sexy.

11
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:27,743
Laserdisc.

12
00:00:27,744 --> 00:00:30,118
I joined a campus volunteer
group that cleans the city.

13
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:31,316
We picked up litter on the freeway

14
00:00:31,317 --> 00:00:32,398
and dredged the river.

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,395
Dredged it for what?

16
00:00:33,396 --> 00:00:34,948
You know, garbage and stuff.

17
00:00:34,949 --> 00:00:37,641
Tires, condoms, needles.

18
00:00:37,981 --> 00:00:39,821
At one point, we found a finger.

19
00:00:39,822 --> 00:00:42,334
Why are you using your
I-love-butterflies voice?

20
00:00:42,335 --> 00:00:43,744
What? Am I?

21
00:00:43,745 --> 00:00:44,560
I don't know.

22
00:00:44,561 --> 00:00:45,645
Volunteer work is nice.

23
00:00:45,646 --> 00:00:47,051
You do nice things.

24
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:48,076
With nice people.

25
00:00:48,077 --> 00:00:49,852
Ooh.

26
00:00:49,853 --> 00:00:53,315
Somebody's finding river
fingers with a cute boy.

27
00:00:53,316 --> 00:00:55,256
What? No.

28
00:00:55,451 --> 00:00:58,168
Well, okay, yes,
but it doesn't matter.

29
00:00:58,169 --> 00:01:00,377
It's not like I'm seeing anyone.
There's just a guy.

30
00:01:00,378 --> 00:01:02,001
- A guy that goes to Greendale?
- Mm.

31
00:01:02,002 --> 00:01:03,840
Is it the Russian guy that
looks like a short Johnny Depp?

32
00:01:03,841 --> 00:01:05,020
- It doesn't matter.
- Is it the guy who looks

33
00:01:05,021 --> 00:01:06,826
a little like Vince Vaughn
but smells a lot like fish?

34
00:01:06,827 --> 00:01:08,347
I don't want to talk about it.

35
00:01:08,348 --> 00:01:10,091
Well, I have someone in my life

36
00:01:10,092 --> 00:01:11,124
that I'm happy to talk about.

37
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:12,604
Again with the Jesus.

38
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:14,096
Well, Jesus is
always in my life,

39
00:01:14,097 --> 00:01:15,932
but things have been
looking better every day

40
00:01:15,933 --> 00:01:17,614
with my ex-husband.

41
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:20,412
Is it the guy that looks
like Anderson Cooper

42
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,717
but with a soul patch
and the ponytail?

43
00:01:21,718 --> 00:01:23,518
- No.
- Is it black Michael Chiklis?

44
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:25,068
- No.
- The white George Foreman?

45
00:01:25,069 --> 00:01:26,705
You guys are talking
about the same person.

46
00:01:26,706 --> 00:01:28,412
He's biracial, his name is David,

47
00:01:28,413 --> 00:01:29,436
and he's a human being.

48
00:01:29,437 --> 00:01:30,825
Guys, stop guessing.

49
00:01:30,826 --> 00:01:32,171
It's not a thing at all.
It's just a friend.

50
00:01:32,172 --> 00:01:35,432
- Change the subject.
- Chang the subject.

51
00:01:36,673 --> 00:01:38,654
What are you doing up there?

52
00:01:39,548 --> 00:01:41,936
It's the beginning of a new
semester of Anthropology.

53
00:01:41,937 --> 00:01:43,645
And I'm here to get
what I was promised.

54
00:01:43,646 --> 00:01:45,897
Sure. Who has Chang's
pile of nothing?

55
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:48,563
- You know what I mean.
- I am sick of the runaround.

56
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,821
I'm here to demand
an immediate answer

57
00:01:50,822 --> 00:01:52,465
about whether I'm
joining the study group.

58
00:01:52,466 --> 00:01:54,840
Well, if we have to
give an immediate answer,

59
00:01:54,841 --> 00:01:55,958
it would have to be no.

60
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:57,011
Take your time.

61
00:01:57,167 --> 00:01:58,448
Sleep on it.

62
00:01:58,449 --> 00:01:59,772
Then get back to me.

63
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,026
Or else.

64
00:02:04,011 --> 00:02:06,735
Jeff, you did say we would
let him in eventually.

65
00:02:06,736 --> 00:02:09,291
That was before he started
using his name as a pun.

66
00:02:09,528 --> 00:02:11,282
It makes me so changry.

67
00:02:11,283 --> 00:02:12,426
Oh, God, it's happening to me.

68
00:02:12,427 --> 00:02:14,013
Let's get back to who
Annie's in love with.

69
00:02:14,014 --> 00:02:15,668
- Is it Fat Neil?
- Blue Streak?

70
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:16,428
Mud Flaps?

71
00:02:16,429 --> 00:02:18,223
Okay, even I know some
of these are Transformers.

72
00:02:18,224 --> 00:02:20,381
Who cares who it is?
Let's just study.

73
00:02:20,382 --> 00:02:21,857
Study what? We haven't
had our first class yet.

74
00:02:21,858 --> 00:02:22,706
Well, could we
talk about something

75
00:02:22,707 --> 00:02:23,631
other than Annie's love life?

76
00:02:23,632 --> 00:02:25,475
We could talk
about my love life.

77
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:28,532
Is it Jean-Claude van Overbite?

78
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,474
We should really start
learning people's names.

79
00:02:30,475 --> 00:02:32,619
I agree with brown
Jamie Lee Curtis.

Duncan's late.

89
00:03:02,073 --> 00:03:04,590
I hope he didn't drive his
car into another marathon.

90
00:03:04,591 --> 00:03:06,720
Shirley, how can you want
to date your ex-husband

91
00:03:06,721 --> 00:03:08,684
- after what he did to you?
- He apologized.

92
00:03:08,685 --> 00:03:10,150
Oh, he apologized.

93
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:12,432
Well, I guess that completely
unbangs that stripper.

94
00:03:12,433 --> 00:03:15,167
Well, forgive me
for being forgiving.

95
00:03:15,168 --> 00:03:17,179
Oh, that's right.
You don't know how.

96
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,931
I'm relieved Shirley
is seeing her ex-husband

97
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:19,912
and not Chang.

98
00:03:19,913 --> 00:03:21,780
Chang? Why would
she be with Chang?

99
00:03:21,878 --> 00:03:24,054
Why do I have to say
everything I'm thinking?

100
00:03:24,092 --> 00:03:26,618
I wish my mouth was further
away from my brain.

101
00:03:26,774 --> 00:03:28,717
I wish my brain had its own brain.

102
00:03:28,731 --> 00:03:30,736
I wish Chang hadn't
had sex with Shirley.

103
00:03:30,737 --> 00:03:32,661
What? When?

104
00:03:32,742 --> 00:03:33,752
Where?

105
00:03:35,187 --> 00:03:36,122
How?

106
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:37,389
I can't talk about it.

107
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,260
Troy, I'm your roommate.

108
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:39,808
I can keep a secret.

109
00:03:40,779 --> 00:03:42,770
Okay, remember
that Halloween party

110
00:03:42,771 --> 00:03:43,771
that none of us can remember?

111
00:03:43,772 --> 00:03:45,477
I don't remember
anything we can remember.

112
00:03:45,478 --> 00:03:47,072
Well, Chang left me
a message that night

113
00:03:47,073 --> 00:03:48,161
saying that they did it.

114
00:03:48,162 --> 00:03:50,490
But... but you can't tell anybody.

115
00:03:51,055 --> 00:03:53,405
You have my word
as your roommate,

116
00:03:53,406 --> 00:03:56,629
and that is a bond I
will never violate.

117
00:03:57,808 --> 00:03:59,212
You can't tweet it either.

118
00:03:59,213 --> 00:04:00,674
We never discussed new media.

119
00:04:00,675 --> 00:04:01,928
Sorry all that
stuff got dragged out

120
00:04:01,929 --> 00:04:04,605
about me having a
crush on somebody.

121
00:04:04,606 --> 00:04:05,977
Why would you be
sorry about that?

122
00:04:05,978 --> 00:04:08,404
You know. Awkward.

123
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,853
Annie, you don't think
I actually care, did you?

124
00:04:10,854 --> 00:04:13,653
No, no, I just didn't want you
to think I thought you cared.

125
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:14,808
Greetings, all and sundry,

126
00:04:14,809 --> 00:04:17,413
and welcome to your second
semester of Anthropology,

127
00:04:17,414 --> 00:04:19,756
where it is about to get real.

128
00:04:20,338 --> 00:04:23,081
Now I forget where we
left off last year.

129
00:04:23,092 --> 00:04:25,056
- Fat Neil.
- The bronze age.

130
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:26,474
Thank you, Fat Neil.

131
00:04:26,514 --> 00:04:27,105
Neil's fine.

132
00:04:27,106 --> 00:04:28,705
Not from an
actuarial standpoint.

133
00:04:28,706 --> 00:04:30,429
Now please forgive my lateness,

134
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:34,143
but I wasn't sure how
to find Greendale sober.

135
00:04:34,617 --> 00:04:36,825
Yes, you heard me right.

136
00:04:37,058 --> 00:04:39,155
I have stopped drinking.

137
00:04:39,543 --> 00:04:42,593
Mainly due to the fact that I
could no longer get an erection.

138
00:04:42,594 --> 00:04:43,604
Now that I'm on the wagon,

139
00:04:43,605 --> 00:04:45,445
you can expect both this class

140
00:04:45,446 --> 00:04:50,096
and my penis to be more
focused and rewarding.

141
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,131
Also, there's gonna be
more than one diorama.

142
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:54,183
Lame!

143
00:04:54,184 --> 00:04:56,472
- Boo.
- I am so sorry.

144
00:04:56,834 --> 00:04:59,983
I train seeing-eye dogs,
and today was graduation.

145
00:05:00,098 --> 00:05:02,158
I couldn't leave without
shaking all their little paws.

146
00:05:02,159 --> 00:05:04,225
- Aww.
- Rich.

147
00:05:04,226 --> 00:05:05,790
- Jeff.
- Rich!

148
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:08,062
- Annie.
- Annie? Rich?

149
00:05:08,063 --> 00:05:09,308
You're taking Anthropology?

150
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,200
Well, you made it sound so fun.

151
00:05:11,201 --> 00:05:12,575
We spent the holiday break

152
00:05:12,576 --> 00:05:14,213
dredging a river together.
We found...

153
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:15,420
A finger. Yeah.

154
00:05:15,421 --> 00:05:16,996
It sounds gruesome, I know,

155
00:05:16,997 --> 00:05:18,551
but I'm used to seeing
that kind of thing,

156
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:20,283
- because I'm a doctor.
- All: Ohh.

157
00:05:24,156 --> 00:05:26,969
I can't believe Rich actually
enrolled in our class.

158
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:28,115
It means he likes me, right?

159
00:05:28,116 --> 00:05:30,256
Why wouldn't he,
Annie? He is so sweet.

160
00:05:30,257 --> 00:05:32,150
Yeah, sweet and wise.

161
00:05:32,151 --> 00:05:34,235
He has lived such a long,
full life.

162
00:05:34,236 --> 00:05:35,355
How old is he again?

163
00:05:35,356 --> 00:05:36,584
30-something, I'm assuming.

164
00:05:36,585 --> 00:05:39,033
He has a landline and
uses the word "album."

165
00:05:39,034 --> 00:05:40,842
You guys don't think he's
too old for me, do you?

166
00:05:40,843 --> 00:05:43,231
- No.
- No. Come on.

167
00:05:43,232 --> 00:05:46,092
By that logic, I wouldn't have a
shot with anybody at this table.

168
00:05:46,093 --> 00:05:46,955
Ugh.

169
00:05:46,956 --> 00:05:48,348
Oh, speaking of creepy,

170
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:50,545
sober Duncan is worse
than drunk Duncan.

171
00:05:50,546 --> 00:05:52,675
I think this class is
about to get really hard.

172
00:05:52,676 --> 00:05:54,063
I have an idea about that.

173
00:05:54,064 --> 00:05:55,146
Rich is really smart,

174
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:56,892
and he knows a lot
about anthropology.

175
00:05:56,893 --> 00:05:58,127
If we were to start
studying with him,

176
00:05:58,128 --> 00:05:59,180
I think it could help a lot.

177
00:05:59,181 --> 00:06:00,970
Plus, you know...

178
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,976
Oh, you know what, though?

179
00:06:03,977 --> 00:06:07,493
I just realized,
so unfair to so many people.

180
00:06:07,494 --> 00:06:09,206
Right? Britta,
you're always talking

181
00:06:09,207 --> 00:06:09,919
about how it's weird

182
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,496
we have no one of Latin descent

183
00:06:11,497 --> 00:06:12,521
- in our group.
- Si.

184
00:06:12,522 --> 00:06:14,104
And, Pierce,
you're always looking

185
00:06:14,105 --> 00:06:15,182
for someone old enough

186
00:06:15,183 --> 00:06:16,989
to find your racism subversive.

187
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,473
I could go on and on.

188
00:06:18,597 --> 00:06:20,349
It is a process.

189
00:06:20,418 --> 00:06:21,319
It takes time.

190
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,225
Well, then I say we
gather all the candidates

191
00:06:24,226 --> 00:06:26,604
and make an informed,
democratic decision.

192
00:06:26,605 --> 00:06:27,807
We can have a little mixer

193
00:06:27,808 --> 00:06:30,330
and invite the people we're
submitting for consideration.

194
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:33,134
- All in favor of tonight?
- Oh, I am.

195
00:06:33,284 --> 00:06:34,227
Thank you. I'm finished.

196
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:36,831
No, I'd say you got
about two more good years.

197
00:06:37,443 --> 00:06:38,920
Oh, everyone,

198
00:06:39,534 --> 00:06:42,264
this is Andre,
my ex-husband and boyfriend.

199
00:06:42,265 --> 00:06:43,963
He came to spend the day with me.

200
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:44,952
Hey, nice to meet you guys.

201
00:06:44,953 --> 00:06:47,409
You know, I've heard a lot
about every last one of you.

202
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,483
We haven't heard a lot
about you or what you've done

203
00:06:49,484 --> 00:06:50,794
or with who.

204
00:06:50,971 --> 00:06:53,464
Well, I hope you give
me a chance to make up

205
00:06:53,465 --> 00:06:55,663
for everything you
haven't heard about me.

206
00:06:55,776 --> 00:06:58,227
Hey, how about a round
of soft serve on me?

207
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,784
Shirley, I've been
fed a lot of soft serve

208
00:07:03,785 --> 00:07:04,869
by a lot of guys.

209
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,140
Sometimes it's rent money,

210
00:07:06,141 --> 00:07:07,708
sometimes it's Chili
Peppers tickets,

211
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:09,147
and, yeah, I'll admit it,

212
00:07:09,148 --> 00:07:11,309
one time it was a gym
bag full of nickels,

213
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:14,266
but it never lasts,
and they never change.

214
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,949
Britta, I'm a grown-ass woman,
and I made my decision.

215
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,278
But how do you know
it's the right one?

216
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:20,303
Because I'm pregnant, okay?

217
00:07:24,108 --> 00:07:27,032
I was going to wait to
share my exciting news,

218
00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:28,899
but I guess now is as good
a time as any to tell you

219
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,788
that I am eight weeks along.

220
00:07:30,789 --> 00:07:32,694
Which is a little surprising.

221
00:07:33,882 --> 00:07:34,893
Halloween.

222
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,645
- What?
- Both: Nothing.

223
00:07:38,728 --> 00:07:42,185
Thanks for coming,
fellow Anthropology students.

224
00:07:42,426 --> 00:07:43,349
For the first semester,

225
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,818
you knew us as "that study group."

226
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:48,060
But, tonight,
we want to get to know you.

227
00:07:48,061 --> 00:07:49,254
Please forgive the spread.

228
00:07:49,255 --> 00:07:50,486
The vending machines
haven't been restocked

229
00:07:50,487 --> 00:07:51,685
since before winter break.

230
00:07:51,686 --> 00:07:54,268
So help yourselves
to tropical skittles,

231
00:07:54,269 --> 00:07:55,663
cigarettes, or mouthwash.

232
00:07:55,664 --> 00:07:58,757
And have a good time.

233
00:08:00,941 --> 00:08:03,619
Okay, so I have to figure
out if Shirley did it

234
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,004
with her ex-husband the
week after Halloween.

235
00:08:06,551 --> 00:08:07,867
How are you gonna do that?

236
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:10,201
I got moves.

237
00:08:10,715 --> 00:08:12,852
So...Bun in the oven.

238
00:08:12,853 --> 00:08:15,504
Guess it's no surprise after
working on it all this time.

239
00:08:15,505 --> 00:08:17,157
Well, I wouldn't quite
say working on it.

240
00:08:17,158 --> 00:08:18,156
Just kind of happens, you know.

241
00:08:18,157 --> 00:08:19,694
Oh, yeah, I do.

242
00:08:19,695 --> 00:08:21,641
Especially when the
season's right.

243
00:08:21,772 --> 00:08:24,188
Dead leaves, pumpkins everywhere...

244
00:08:24,528 --> 00:08:26,983
Nature's Viagra. Right?

245
00:08:27,483 --> 00:08:27,991
I guess.

246
00:08:27,992 --> 00:08:29,264
And then when all the pumpkins

247
00:08:29,265 --> 00:08:30,915
just start to rot

248
00:08:31,035 --> 00:08:33,404
and all the children have
removed their outfits

249
00:08:34,143 --> 00:08:37,211
because they've already
gotten their candy...

250
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,193
I'm gonna go talk to some
other people, all right?

251
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:50,164
- So?
- His mind is like a fortress.

252
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,008
Why don't we just tell Shirley,

253
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:54,046
"Hey, look, you slept with Chang"?

254
00:08:54,047 --> 00:08:55,217
Let her deal with it.

255
00:08:55,218 --> 00:08:56,750
Pierce, if someone
had sex with Chang

256
00:08:56,751 --> 00:08:58,771
and they get to not
remember that happened,

257
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:00,357
that's a gift from God.

258
00:09:00,358 --> 00:09:02,474
I'm not taking that away from
her without a good reason.

259
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:03,471
Well, here's a good reason.

260
00:09:03,472 --> 00:09:04,343
You ever go to the bathroom

261
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:05,446
and find parsley in your teeth

262
00:09:05,447 --> 00:09:07,935
that your friends
hadn't told you about?

263
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,782
Now imagine your
teeth are a uterus

264
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:12,552
and that parsley is
a half-Chinese baby.

265
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:13,408
Hey, guys.

266
00:09:13,484 --> 00:09:14,922
I want you to meet someone.

267
00:09:15,367 --> 00:09:16,731
My name is Quendra,

268
00:09:16,768 --> 00:09:18,393
and I spell it with a Q-U.

269
00:09:18,394 --> 00:09:20,779
She's thinking about
taking Anthropology.

270
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:23,162
So maybe she would make
a nice addition or two

271
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:25,567
to our study group.
Something to consider.

272
00:09:25,568 --> 00:09:27,084
Are you Abed?

273
00:09:27,085 --> 00:09:28,765
I love Star Wars.

274
00:09:28,766 --> 00:09:31,477
- That's Troy.
- I love footballs.

275
00:09:31,478 --> 00:09:33,379
Jeff, we're dealing with
heavier things right now

276
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,092
than your shameless lobbying.

277
00:09:35,093 --> 00:09:36,570
Rich brought kettle corn!

278
00:09:36,571 --> 00:09:38,849
Kettle corn!
That's a fun-time snack.

279
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,953
- Oh, looks great.
- I make it in my garage.

280
00:09:41,621 --> 00:09:43,173
I'll take some of that.

281
00:09:44,696 --> 00:09:46,649
I spell kettle corn with a Q-U.

282
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,077
Well, don't.

283
00:09:48,466 --> 00:09:49,946
What is this? What's going on?

284
00:09:49,947 --> 00:09:50,636
It's a mixer.

285
00:09:50,637 --> 00:09:52,786
Why is everyone from
Anthro class here?

286
00:09:53,263 --> 00:09:55,439
Are you guys picking a
new study group member?

287
00:09:55,501 --> 00:09:57,135
And you didn't invite me?

288
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:58,427
We didn't know how to reach you.

289
00:09:58,428 --> 00:10:00,797
What are you talking about?
I'm everywhere.

290
00:10:01,073 --> 00:10:02,174
We didn't know how to reach you.

291
00:10:02,175 --> 00:10:04,233
That's not a true. That's a lie.

292
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:06,133
It's a mixer. We didn't
know how to reach you.

293
00:10:06,134 --> 00:10:07,933
It's a mixer. It's a mixer.
It's a mixer.

294
00:10:07,934 --> 00:10:09,610
It's a mixer. It's a mixer.

295
00:10:11,735 --> 00:10:12,830
Works every time.

296
00:10:16,108 --> 00:10:18,632
$50? What a pig.

297
00:10:25,388 --> 00:10:27,963
Jeff, I think we
should vote now.

298
00:10:27,964 --> 00:10:29,800
Most people left after
we ran out of skittles,

299
00:10:29,801 --> 00:10:31,348
and, come on, it's pretty obvious

300
00:10:31,349 --> 00:10:32,254
Rich is the best candidate.

301
00:10:32,255 --> 00:10:34,187
Yeah. Looks like he's our guy.

302
00:10:34,188 --> 00:10:35,241
I'll be right there.

303
00:10:36,841 --> 00:10:38,482
This can't be happening.

304
00:10:38,797 --> 00:10:40,233
I agree.

305
00:10:44,837 --> 00:10:46,351
You can't talk and
then do a slow clap.

306
00:10:46,352 --> 00:10:47,888
You don't know that.

307
00:10:48,035 --> 00:10:49,201
But I know this.

308
00:10:49,487 --> 00:10:52,505
Unless you want a front row
seat to Annie loves Richie,

309
00:10:52,506 --> 00:10:55,938
it's time to Chang
your point of view.

310
00:10:55,939 --> 00:10:57,195
It's not even clever.

311
00:10:57,196 --> 00:10:59,334
You keep using it
as the word change.

312
00:11:02,209 --> 00:11:03,952
Okay. Okay.

313
00:11:03,953 --> 00:11:07,720
Okay. Just do me a favor.

314
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:09,880
Let me do all the talking
and follow my lead.

315
00:11:09,881 --> 00:11:11,435
- Deal.
- Okay.

316
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:14,921
Seriously,
do you have brain damage?

317
00:11:14,922 --> 00:11:17,295
Rich is also board-certified
in pediatrics,

318
00:11:17,296 --> 00:11:19,527
and, once a month,
he flies down to volunteer

319
00:11:19,528 --> 00:11:22,051
in the rain forest,
fixing children's cleft palates

320
00:11:22,052 --> 00:11:24,057
and teaching them acoustic guitar.

321
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:24,944
Other than that,

322
00:11:24,945 --> 00:11:27,656
well, his kettle corn
speaks for itself.

323
00:11:27,657 --> 00:11:28,956
I couldn't agree more.

324
00:11:28,957 --> 00:11:31,255
It looks like this is
an open-and-shut case.

325
00:11:31,256 --> 00:11:33,230
Did someone say case?

326
00:11:33,232 --> 00:11:34,966
Because I haven't made mine yet.

327
00:11:34,967 --> 00:11:36,987
What? What's your case?

328
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:39,563
Ben Chang is my case.

329
00:11:39,564 --> 00:11:40,938
You can't be serious.

330
00:11:40,939 --> 00:11:42,308
Oh, I'm serious, baby.

331
00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:43,623
I am yahoo serious.

332
00:11:43,624 --> 00:11:44,634
I'm serious F.M.

333
00:11:44,635 --> 00:11:47,009
Welcome to the world
serious of seriousness,

334
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:49,185
sponsored by honey nut serios.

335
00:11:49,186 --> 00:11:50,465
Are you stalling right now?

336
00:11:50,466 --> 00:11:51,670
Stalling?

337
00:11:53,726 --> 00:11:54,788
Stalling?

338
00:11:54,789 --> 00:11:56,834
No, Annie, in fact,
you're gonna wish

339
00:11:56,835 --> 00:11:58,859
I was stalling...
Oh, I just got it. Thank you.

340
00:12:02,094 --> 00:12:03,729
I want to say some names to you.

341
00:12:04,719 --> 00:12:05,847
Jeffrey Dahmer.

342
00:12:06,763 --> 00:12:07,929
Ted Bundy.

343
00:12:09,506 --> 00:12:10,480
Rich.

344
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:12,849
What do they have in common?

345
00:12:13,822 --> 00:12:16,395
We don't know them very well.

346
00:12:16,746 --> 00:12:18,803
What do we know about Ben Chang?

347
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,564
- We know he's nuts.
- Let him finish!

348
00:12:21,644 --> 00:12:24,639
We know he's dangerous,
unpredictable, selfish.

349
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,292
We know he uses his
name to make bad puns.

350
00:12:27,293 --> 00:12:28,530
Guilty as changed.

351
00:12:28,531 --> 00:12:31,792
When he talks,
he over and underemphasizes words

352
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,123
seemingly at random.

353
00:12:33,124 --> 00:12:35,281
When he eats, he holds his fork

354
00:12:35,282 --> 00:12:36,926
like a murderer's knife,

355
00:12:36,927 --> 00:12:40,727
gnawing at its skewered payload
like a deranged woodland rodent.

356
00:12:40,728 --> 00:12:41,627
Bring it home!

357
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:43,370
We know he smells
like band-aids.

358
00:12:43,371 --> 00:12:45,613
We know he dresses like
a Cuban cab driver.

359
00:12:45,614 --> 00:12:49,262
We know he exhibits,
nay, flaunts proudly

360
00:12:49,263 --> 00:12:51,946
obvious symptoms of over
half a dozen disorders

361
00:12:51,947 --> 00:12:54,474
you wouldn't wish on
your worst enemy's pets.

362
00:12:54,475 --> 00:12:55,558
Feel the heat!

363
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:58,969
We know these things
about Ben Chang.

364
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:02,408
And so much more than we ever
wanted to know about him.

365
00:13:02,409 --> 00:13:03,302
Why?

366
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,943
Because it's there.

367
00:13:06,255 --> 00:13:08,427
It's on the surface.

368
00:13:08,434 --> 00:13:11,352
What you see may be
what you don't want,

369
00:13:11,353 --> 00:13:14,926
but it's also what you get.

370
00:13:16,064 --> 00:13:16,999
Wow.

371
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,504
Who is this
kettle-corn-popping phantom?

372
00:13:20,739 --> 00:13:22,468
This human question mark?

373
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:25,002
This number eight scoop
of vanilla tapioca

374
00:13:25,003 --> 00:13:27,343
with a Ph.D in being swell

375
00:13:27,344 --> 00:13:29,874
and a master's in
"everybody loves me"?

376
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:30,925
Who is it?

377
00:13:33,921 --> 00:13:35,164
We may never know.

378
00:13:37,138 --> 00:13:39,631
I only know one thing.

379
00:13:41,043 --> 00:13:43,567
Nobody is this good a person.

380
00:13:45,326 --> 00:13:48,393
And nobody can get any worse

381
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:49,520
than this.

382
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:54,727
Now.

383
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,234
Who's voting for Chang?

384
00:14:06,157 --> 00:14:08,136
Who's voting for Rich?

385
00:14:11,669 --> 00:14:13,649
- Shirley.
- Wow, what you gonna do, baby?

386
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,011
I don't know.

387
00:14:17,081 --> 00:14:20,177
Shirley, this is the best
kettle corn I've ever had.

388
00:14:20,178 --> 00:14:21,959
If you don't vote for Rich,

389
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,510
I'll shatter your world.

390
00:14:23,511 --> 00:14:24,296
You're gonna what?

391
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:25,833
I'll shatter your world.

392
00:14:25,834 --> 00:14:27,583
I heard you. I vote for Chang.

393
00:14:27,584 --> 00:14:30,307
- Yes!
- Yes! In your face!

394
00:14:30,308 --> 00:14:31,699
- No!
- Yes!

395
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,594
No!

396
00:14:33,569 --> 00:14:36,089
Chang and Shirley had
sex on Halloween.

397
00:14:37,062 --> 00:14:37,920
What?

398
00:14:38,037 --> 00:14:39,401
- What?
- You may be pregnant

399
00:14:39,402 --> 00:14:43,260
- with his baby.
- No. No, no, no, no. Mm-mm.

400
00:14:43,261 --> 00:14:44,157
Pierce!

401
00:14:44,668 --> 00:14:45,948
She crossed me.

402
00:14:45,949 --> 00:14:49,839
Is that why you were subtly
interrogating me?

403
00:14:50,229 --> 00:14:52,118
- Troy?
- Chang left me a voice mail

404
00:14:52,119 --> 00:14:55,512
on Halloween to say
that you two did it.

405
00:14:55,513 --> 00:14:57,132
I could hear you
in the background.

406
00:14:57,913 --> 00:14:59,670
Shirley,
what is he talking about?

407
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:01,547
I don't remember that night.

408
00:15:01,745 --> 00:15:02,889
Nobody remembers anything.

409
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:05,952
Oh, now I understand
these photos.

410
00:15:07,635 --> 00:15:09,606
Do you mind if I forward
these to my brother?

411
00:15:09,607 --> 00:15:12,053
Oh! I want this man out of here.

412
00:15:12,054 --> 00:15:13,820
Well, you just
voted him in, so...

413
00:15:13,821 --> 00:15:15,389
What is wrong with you?

414
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,567
Shirley is in crisis.

415
00:15:16,568 --> 00:15:18,139
This isn't silly anymore.

416
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,577
I don't understand.

417
00:15:19,773 --> 00:15:21,339
Just... just wait, baby.

418
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,118
I don't understand either,
but we can work this out.

419
00:15:23,119 --> 00:15:24,400
We'll figure it out.

420
00:15:27,976 --> 00:15:29,220
Andre, no.

421
00:15:31,858 --> 00:15:35,431
I think that this
is a good time to go.

422
00:15:35,432 --> 00:15:36,440
Rich!

423
00:15:36,441 --> 00:15:37,453
No!

424
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,166
You finally did it, Jeff Winger.

425
00:15:43,551 --> 00:15:46,269
You finally hurt this group
in a way that'll never heal.

426
00:15:48,728 --> 00:15:49,918
Kettle corn!

427
00:15:56,481 --> 00:15:57,498
There you are.

428
00:15:58,268 --> 00:15:59,476
Can you please explain to me

429
00:15:59,477 --> 00:16:00,422
what the hell you've been doing?

430
00:16:00,423 --> 00:16:02,339
Well, Annie, when a man

431
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,075
loves food and beverages very much

432
00:16:04,076 --> 00:16:05,609
and they pass through his system,

433
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,495
- they make...
- I'm not in the mood, Jeff.

434
00:16:07,496 --> 00:16:08,320
Explain your behavior

435
00:16:08,321 --> 00:16:09,529
with Rich today.

436
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,476
Sorry, not everyone
is as in love

437
00:16:11,477 --> 00:16:13,720
with Dr. Do-No-Wrong as you are.

438
00:16:13,721 --> 00:16:15,232
And don't say it's
because I'm jealous

439
00:16:15,233 --> 00:16:16,053
of him being with you.

440
00:16:16,054 --> 00:16:18,252
Oh, come on, Jeff!

441
00:16:18,253 --> 00:16:19,286
I'm sick of this.

442
00:16:19,287 --> 00:16:20,789
One minute, I'm too young to date.

443
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:23,062
The next, you're trying
to get rid of guys I like.

444
00:16:23,063 --> 00:16:24,862
Either you want me or you don't.

445
00:16:24,863 --> 00:16:25,797
What's it gonna be?

446
00:16:25,798 --> 00:16:27,202
I wish I could
give you an answer

447
00:16:27,203 --> 00:16:30,284
that makes sense, but
relationships are complicated,

448
00:16:30,285 --> 00:16:31,830
and we're in the men's room.

449
00:16:31,831 --> 00:16:35,221
Fine. Well,
I'm gonna ask Rich out.

450
00:16:35,478 --> 00:16:37,070
Nothing complicated about that.

451
00:16:40,993 --> 00:16:42,060
- There you are.
- Did I walk

452
00:16:42,061 --> 00:16:43,132
into the wrong bathroom?

453
00:16:43,133 --> 00:16:44,819
You have to find
Andre and talk to him.

454
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,186
Shirley is devastated.

455
00:16:46,187 --> 00:16:48,286
Since when do you want
him back in her life?

456
00:16:48,287 --> 00:16:50,250
I don't deny that I'm
not a fan of the guy,

457
00:16:50,251 --> 00:16:51,214
but I'm a fan of Shirley,

458
00:16:51,215 --> 00:16:52,893
and this is what she wants.

459

460
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:02,449
There you are.

461
00:17:09,747 --> 00:17:10,990
Mezzanine?

462
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:20,179
- Nice sweater.
- Thanks.

463
00:17:20,444 --> 00:17:21,813
My dad gave it to me.

464
00:17:22,981 --> 00:17:26,786
- So, um...
- Look, I'm not mad at Shirley.

465
00:17:26,955 --> 00:17:27,964
You're not?

466
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,450
No. I'm mad at myself.

467
00:17:31,111 --> 00:17:32,632
You know, if I hadn't
left her like I did,

468
00:17:32,633 --> 00:17:34,310
then none of this
would have happened.

469
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:38,175
You ever have something that
you didn't truly appreciate

470
00:17:38,176 --> 00:17:40,023
until you didn't have it anymore?

471
00:17:40,024 --> 00:17:43,387
Oh, yeah. Keristina.

472
00:17:43,737 --> 00:17:44,439
Old girlfriend?

473
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,708
Almond facial scrub.

474
00:17:45,709 --> 00:17:47,142
They only make it in Finland.

475
00:17:48,357 --> 00:17:51,005
The old me would have
been long gone by now.

476
00:17:51,545 --> 00:17:52,891
I didn't think I
could ever change,

477
00:17:52,892 --> 00:17:55,064
but I'm gonna tell you,
the love of a good woman

478
00:17:55,065 --> 00:17:56,557
makes anything possible.

479
00:17:59,664 --> 00:18:01,864
Well, it looks like I'm
gonna be a daddy again.

480
00:18:02,255 --> 00:18:03,691
- Yeah, but...
- Hey.

481
00:18:03,846 --> 00:18:06,028
Doesn't matter who
the baby's father is.

482
00:18:06,178 --> 00:18:07,799
I'm in it for the long haul.

483
00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:09,584
And if it's mine,

484
00:18:09,868 --> 00:18:11,578
it's gonna be a great
football player.

485
00:18:12,005 --> 00:18:13,327
And if it's Chang's,

486
00:18:14,699 --> 00:18:16,098
we'll go for golf.

487
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:26,209
- Hey.
- Hey.

488
00:18:28,772 --> 00:18:30,211
Annie just texted me.

489
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,533
She asked Rich out.

490
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,536
Cool.

491
00:18:33,537 --> 00:18:34,548
He said no.

492
00:18:35,635 --> 00:18:37,771
He said she's great but too young.

493
00:19:11,206 --> 00:19:13,692
Don't say anything until
I've said what I've got to say.

494
00:19:14,637 --> 00:19:16,723
I've known you for
almost two years now,

495
00:19:16,724 --> 00:19:20,298
and I've never taken you as
seriously as I should have.

496
00:19:20,843 --> 00:19:25,607
You are the strangest,
coolest, most genuine person

497
00:19:25,608 --> 00:19:29,600
I've ever met,
and the thing that scares me

498
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:33,080
about you is how good
you make me wish I was.

499
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,383
Help me, Rich.

500
00:19:36,705 --> 00:19:38,299
Help me become like you.

501
00:19:39,389 --> 00:19:43,814
I mean, I am so amazing.

502
00:19:45,448 --> 00:19:47,118
But I'm not perfect.

503
00:19:48,713 --> 00:19:49,644
You are.

504
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:53,064
Give me that power.

505
00:19:54,423 --> 00:19:56,016
So I can abuse it.

506
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:59,915
Jeff, you are one funny bunny.

507
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:01,577
You can't just fake being good

508
00:20:01,578 --> 00:20:03,207
in order to get away
with doing bad things.

509
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,172
Oh, I completely understand.

510
00:20:05,521 --> 00:20:09,606
And do you understand
that I still have to try?

511
00:20:10,225 --> 00:20:12,634
And if you don't help me,

512
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,422
you're a bad person.

513
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:17,736
You got me there, guy.

514
00:20:17,871 --> 00:20:19,466
Come on in and dry off.

515
00:20:20,891 --> 00:20:23,590
Oh, it smells delicious.
Are you baking?

516
00:20:23,591 --> 00:20:25,315
Yeah, muffin tops.

517
00:20:26,904 --> 00:20:28,252
And we're back.
Today, we'll show you

518
00:20:28,253 --> 00:20:30,286
how to make homemade
kettle corn with Dr. Rich.

519
00:20:30,287 --> 00:20:31,090
Rich, how do I get

520
00:20:31,091 --> 00:20:32,421
one of those giant spoons?

521
00:20:32,422 --> 00:20:34,724
Well, actually,
I carved this one myself

522
00:20:34,725 --> 00:20:36,946
after lightning struck an
oak tree in my backyard.

523
00:20:36,947 --> 00:20:38,919
- Ooh.
- And then I made my nephew

524
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,687
a rocking horse.

525
00:20:39,688 --> 00:20:42,055
- That's adorable.
- It smells heavenly.

526
00:20:42,056 --> 00:20:43,986
Dr. Rich, what sets
your kettle corn apart?

527
00:20:43,987 --> 00:20:45,754
Well, it's a secret ingredient...

528
00:20:45,755 --> 00:20:47,143
a couple extra pinches of love.

529
00:20:47,144 --> 00:20:48,900
Oh, you can't beat that.

530
00:20:48,901 --> 00:20:50,470
- It feels good.
- Not this again.

531
00:20:50,471 --> 00:20:53,202
Rich, you know they're
doing a fake morning show?

532
00:20:53,514 --> 00:20:54,796
There are no cameras.

533
00:20:55,152 --> 00:20:56,048
I know.

534
00:20:56,203 --> 00:20:58,181
It's just a fun way
to start the day.

535
00:20:58,182 --> 00:20:59,576
So grab a paddle, partner,

536
00:20:59,577 --> 00:21:01,004
and hop on in here.

537
00:21:01,005 --> 00:21:02,677
You know what,
that does sound...

538
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:03,628
Yeah.

539
00:21:05,552 --> 00:21:08,195
Troy and Abed in the morning.
