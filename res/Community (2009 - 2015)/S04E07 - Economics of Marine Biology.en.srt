1
00:00:01,084 --> 00:00:02,586
His name is Archie DeCoste.

2
00:00:02,878 --> 00:00:05,881
Age: 22.
Total years spent in high school: Seven.

3
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:07,966
SAT score: Zero.

4
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:12,346
And he was recently arrested for
selling marijuana to a police officer...

5
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:13,764
at a police station.

6
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:16,308
So you want us to help
you recruit this idiot...

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,019
instead of an honours student
or a science genius?

8
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:21,021
Do we go to the same Greendale?

9
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:24,399
But let me reveal the fortune
inside this cookie.

10
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,319
Family net worth: $8 million.

11
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:29,279
Ladies and gentlemen...

12
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:33,200
this is what we in the community
college recruiting game call a whale.

13
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:37,496
The perfect mix of low intellect,
high lack of ambition...

14
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:39,289
and limitless parental support.

15
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,750
So a rich dumb-dumb
who will never graduate...

16
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,670
and keep dropping money into
the school. Got it.

17
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:46,296
Is there much money in this...

18
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:49,841
or is it like that endorsement deal
you made with Let's Potato Chips?

19
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,594
If you don't like the crispy-licious
taste of Let's...

20
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,222
feel free to eat
that other greasy brand.

21
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:58,350
- Splingles? Not this guy.
- Thank you, Troy.

22
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:01,937
And I will explain the value
of this whale...

23
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:05,315
by describing one who's been
swimming right under your nose.

24
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:10,862
Pierce Hawthorne has taken 80 percent
of Greendale's classes more than twice.

25
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:14,741
He is the only Greendale student who
has ever paid for a premium locker...

26
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,077
or the extended pencil warranty.

27
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:19,538
Pierce cannot know about this,
okay?

28
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,584
He's a big baby who throws tantrums
when anyone else gets attention.

29
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,169
Remember when Kerri Strug
visited our campus?

30
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:27,461
That was horrible.

31
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:32,259
I have scheduled Archie's visit for
tomorrow when Pierce has no classes.

32
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:36,096
Guys, I'm asking,
as treasurer of the Forensics Club.

33
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:39,099
The dean said we could use
whale money for a new body farm.

34
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:41,643
- Who wants to help?
- I'm in. Sounds like a romper.

35
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,813
We do need money. The Biology
Department has been dissecting...

36
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,773
the same dead pig for 10 years.

37
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:49,526
If we land this kid,
we can buy a hundred dead pigs...

38
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,028
and make everybody happy.

39
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,155
I'll help, but I started a new PE class.

40
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:56,527
I've been avoiding it for three years,
but you can't run from running forever.

41
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:58,910
I'm in PE too.
I made room in my trophy case.

42
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,580
Then I remembered classes
don't give out trophies...

43
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:03,498
so I put a fishbowl there instead.

44
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,292
It's been quite the week.

45
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:07,919
So the rest of us will have
to pick up the slack...

46
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,422
and, yes, Jeffrey,
I assume you're out...

47
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:14,009
because of your track record
of literally being too cool for school.

48
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,637
Actually, you can count me in
on this one.

49
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:19,139
- What?
- You had me at "no Pierce."

50
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:21,767
He's been all over me lately
to hang out. It's weird.

51
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:23,977
You just want to be a part
of something.

52
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:27,814
Admit it, Thanksgiving softened
that Winger underbelly.

53
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,067
Britta.

54
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:32,986
Now, let's set sail
and hunt that whale.

55
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,822
- Yeah.
- Hey, let's do this.

56
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,658
You know
what the commercial says.

57
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,285
"Keep your damn hands
off my Let's."

58
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:44,206
♪ Give me some more
Time in a dream ♪

59
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:47,584
♪ Give me the hope

64
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:10,982
Hey, Jeff, there you are.

65
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:14,152
I was thinking we could swing by
this great barbershop I know.

66
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:17,948
You're looking a little stubbly and
nobody handles a razor like an Italian.

67
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,493
They develop nimble fingers
from pleasing their mistresses.

68
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:24,371
Thank you for opening my eyes
to two new stereotypes.

69
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:28,375
Now, how can I put this?
No, I don't want to go.

70
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:31,628
Not now, not ever. No.

71
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,506
No prob.

72
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,717
We'll work around your skedge.

73
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,636
- Okay. Pierce is gone.
- Yes.

74
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:42,305
Walking Dead has left.
Resume Operation Deadliest Catch.

75
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:46,476
Archie is gonna love this banner.
The name-brand glitter really shows.

76
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:51,648
- School board guys in the hizzy.
- Richie. Richie, pace yourself.

77
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,276
Hey, there, dean.
Just thought we'd pop in...

78
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,194
and check on the big whale hunt.

79
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:59,030
What a day we have planned
for young Archie.

80
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:02,159
Library tour,
calculator lab demonstration...

81
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:06,371
And it all culminates in
the Spirit of Greendale reception.

82
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:07,998
Magnitude is a soft yes.

83
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,750
That's a get.

84
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,585
As much as we love
that Magnitude...

85
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:15,714
- your tour may be lacking a little...
- Tour sucks, bro.

86
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,924
- What?
- You gotta think big.

87
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:21,428
- Hookers, blow, hookers.
- Oh, my.

88
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,848
He's been mixing.
But there is some wisdom there.

89
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,018
We need this whale money.
The kid likes snowboarding.

90
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:32,189
Maybe Shaun White finds his way
on the faculty roster.

91
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:35,984
He likes to party.
Maybe Greendale suddenly has a frat.

92
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,361
The Delta Cubes or whatever.

93
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:41,865
- You're not considering this, are you?
- No. Greendale stands on its own.

94
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:44,618
No hookers, no blow,
no Shaun White frat.

95
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,620
College dean threatening
a fraternity.

96
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,749
You'll never shut down
the Delta Cubes.

97
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,376
- What?
- Delta Cubes, Delta Cubes...

98
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,879
Look, it's your call, Craig.

99
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,548
Don't let this whale swim away.

100
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,635
Cruise by Skeeper's Express
for a refill?

101
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:03,094
I'll second that motion.

102
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,808
Been working on victory dances.

103
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,601
Basketball...

104
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,603
football...

105
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:14,147
and crab soccer.
That one's the hard one.

106
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,816
That's nice.

107
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,901
Hey, when I was in grade school...

108
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:21,446
PE was about being picked on
and picked last...

109
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,615
but you'll put me on your team,
right?

110
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,283
Right. But also wrong.

111
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:29,162
- PE is about survival of the fittest.
- Line up, class.

112
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,167
Welcome to PEE.
I'm Coach Jason Chapman.

113
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,211
Physical Education Education?

114
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,672
Thought that was a typo
in the course "cartalog."

115
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:40,257
It started as a typo...

116
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:43,593
but it's grown into one of Greendale's
most successful programmes.

117
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,136
Anyone can take PE.

118
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,848
I teach my student coaches
to teach PE.

119
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:52,310
- Something funny, Coach Barnes?
- No, it's just...

120
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,354
You're teaching us
how to be gym teachers.

121
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:58,024
Gym teachers?
A gym is a building...

122
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:01,945
a man-made structure inside
which physical education teachers...

123
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:05,657
teach physical education
to physical education students.

124
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:08,952
Pop quiz, Coach Barnes. A student is
choking on a plastic golf ball.

125
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:10,453
- What do you do?
- I...

126
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:13,206
How many cones does it take
to line a soccer field?

127
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,209
What if students are talking
during stretches?

128
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:20,130
When my kids talk past bedtime,
I use my angry voice and I say:

129
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:23,633
"The next peep I hear will be the last."
And I give them one of these:

130
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:24,925
Not bad, Coach Bennett.

131
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,221
- Look at me.
- I see you.

132
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,058
Two hours late?

133
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,395
It's the lack of follow-through
that makes Archie so appealing...

134
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,188
but still send a text, right?

135
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:41,067
Okay, Abed, I told you
we're not doing the fraternity idea.

136
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,987
Delta Cubes will never die.
We've only just begun to fight.

137
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:46,072
You only began yesterday.

138
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:49,576
- Whale, ho. Look alive, everyone.
- What are you guys all doing out here?

139
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:52,662
- Oh, no. Pierce will ruin everything.
- What's an Archie?

140
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:55,206
- Why does he get a banner?
- Jeff, do something.

141
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,300
There you are, Pierce. Thought
you were gonna cancel our plans.

142
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,510
- Plans?
- To spend the entire day together...

143
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,220
away from everyone else.

144
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,933
Oh, yeah. Those plans.

145
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,436
Suck it, bozos. You're getting ditched
by the cool kids.

146
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:19,940
Oh, what a day we're gonna have.
Text me the instant I can ditch him.

147
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,068
Hey, guys. Sweet campus.

148
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,569
Welcome to Greendale.

149
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,948
I'm Bean Pelton. "Bean" Pelton?
Dean Pelton. Gosh, I'm nervous.

150
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,116
Please enroll in our school,
please, please.

151
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,202
Nice scooter, Archie.

152
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:34,204
City College gave it to me
as a present.

153
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:36,873
City College?
City College bought you a Vespa?

154
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,792
Brand-new.

155
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,588
So, Archie, have you heard about our
Half-Pipes and Hash Pipes class?

156
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,257
- Taught by Professor Shaun White.
- What?

157
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,552
Yeah. Let me tell you about it
in our Mountain Dew Cool Zone Tent.

158
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,484
Put up a tent,
write "Mountain Dew" on it.

159
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:54,057
Here we go. Let's keep going.
This is our library.

160
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,815
Okay. Archie, why don't you
hang 10 on the web...

161
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,401
while I talk business.
And you know what?

162
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,945
- You can take that computer.
- Sweet.

163
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:10,490
- I can drop it off an overpass.
- I shouldn't have heard that.

164
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,410
Dean, you're giving him
our computers?

165
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:17,372
Because he is a 22-year-old stonerhead
whose parents bought him a GED.

166
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,165
Which college is
he going to choose?

167
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:22,335
Vespa State
or Look at our Library University?

168
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,129
Those school board guys were right.

169
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,297
- Britta, where do we get drugs?
- Really?

170
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:28,299
Look who stumbled
onto the high road.

171
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:29,634
This is a slippery slope.

172
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,887
City College slipped that slope
when they slipped him that scooter.

173
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,558
But they sure slipped up
when they let him set foot on our soil.

174
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,936
Three, two, one.

175
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,605
Time!

176
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:47,694
Coach Barnes, it seems dodge ball
storage isn't quite in your skill set...

177
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:50,280
much like table tennis prep.

178
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:51,948
Excellent job, Coach Bennett.

179
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,118
You have the spatial reasoning skills
of a young Kevin Miller...

180
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,203
a really good PE teacher I know.

181
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:01,041
The skill of ranking others
in order of ability is crucial.

182
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,918
In this next drill,
our two best student coaches...

183
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,297
will split the rest of the class.
Coach Bennett, Coach Neil.

184
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:08,715
- Yeah.
- Pick your teams.

185
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:10,675
- Coach Donovan.
- Coach Goldman.

186
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,207
- Coach McKenna.
- Coach Cutler.

187
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:14,054
- Coach Winston.
- Coach Dornetto.

188
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,638
- Coach Guest.
- Coach Panos.

189
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,892
Choose wisely.

190
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:23,229
You're one decision away
from victory or defeat.

191
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:27,192
Coach Marzec.

192
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:31,696
Well picked, Coach Bennett.
Your team wins.

193
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,573
We won. Nice.

194
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:35,742
The barbershop.

195
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:38,745
A reminder of a bygone era
when men were men...

196
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:41,915
and women were sex cooks
who did laundry.

197
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,042
I've been getting a shave here
for decades.

198
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:47,337
And, apparently, reading the same
eight magazines the entire time.

199
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:51,466
Yeah, National Geographic's got some
tribal boob shots that are exquisite.

200
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:55,095
There's something about a breast that's
never been touched by white hands.

201
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:57,263
You are a complicated man.

202
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,349
Silvio, spin up lucky number seven.

203
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:09,484
You know what?
That feels good, I'll give you that.

204
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,947
Now that soda goblet gets
you free refills in the cafeteria...

205
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:17,200
and it was painted
by our Professor Ed Hardy.

206
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,954
- Who teaches bikini class.
- Oh, yeah!

207
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:25,125
Check out that bling. I want that.

208
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,919
You heard him, Annie.
Bling the king.

209
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:30,630
- Just take it off of him. There you go.
- Thank you.

210
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:33,967
Delta Cubes, prepare to bond
through embarrassment.

211
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:36,094
Pacifiers in.

212
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,638
Commence...
Code Dean! Code Dean!

213
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:42,642
Gosh dean it, Abed.
I told you, no fraternities!

214
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:44,727
There's soda all over my kicks.

215
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,814
Britta, give Archie your scarf
so he can dry his kicks.

216
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:50,150
- Dry his kicks. Put your back into it.
- No.

217
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,318
Line drawn.

218
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,737
If I wanted to wait on a rich man
hand and foot...

219
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,991
I would've gone to Dubai
with that sheik I met at Trader Joe's.

220
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:04,414
Don't worry about her, Archie.
Onward to the microbrew pizzatorium.

221
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:08,376
I think all a man needs in life is
a close shave, a cold beer...

222
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,379
and, you know,
maybe a faithful dog.

223
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,883
I had a chocolate lab growing up.
Rosie.

224
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,844
She used to wake me up
every morning by licking my feet.

225
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:20,513
Mine was Walter,
a German Shepherd.

226
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,473
Followed me to school every day.

227
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,518
I'd look out the window
and there he was...

228
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,354
dropping a steaming fat one
on the lawn.

229
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:32,025
Would someone please tell me
why I've been shaving my own face...

230
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:34,986
all these years like a sucker?

231
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,991
This state-of-the-art
mock locker room...

232
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:42,285
or "mocker room,"
simulates conditions...

233
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:45,538
- of an actual locker room.
- Don't we have an actual locker room?

234
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,208
You think you're ready for that,
Coach Barnes?

235
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,795
For our next drill, drama students
will play the role of PE students...

236
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,506
and you will oversee them
in a mocker room setting.

237
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:58,176
My character just had
her first period.

238
00:11:58,468 --> 00:11:59,510
Mine has eczema.

239
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:02,222
- Coach Bennett, care to go first?
- Yes.

240
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,229
Keep your hands to yourself!
Running will get you five laps, mister.

241
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:13,233
Joey! I will come in that shower
and kick your bare ass!

242
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,525
Sorry, Coach Bennett.

243
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,820
I have never seen
such natural disciplinary skills.

244
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:21,032
You're up next, Coach Barnes.
Entertain us with your ineptitude.

245
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,412
How's the foam machine coming,
Leonard?

246
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,248
Memories will be made tonight.

247
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,042
Destiny. Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

248
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:35,296
Oh, I did get your Christmas card.
No. So... No, no. No time to pre-party.

249
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,132
You and the girls get in position
and wait for my signal.

250
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,093
- Strippers?
- Oh, tons.

251
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:41,761
It's good for the school.

252
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,765
The whale is here. Balloon drop, go.

253
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:51,938
There you go. Release the whores.

254
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:54,691
- Oh, yeah.
- No way!

255
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,612
Pierce.

256
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:03,908
I was wrong about this shop.
It really is special.

257
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,287
Well, if you like the place so much,
why don't you gay marry it?

258
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:17,964
You probably didn't notice, Jeff, but I've
been trying to get us some alone time.

259
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:19,966
I might have picked up on that.

260
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:22,468
I'm no stranger to father issues.

261
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,138
I know confronting your dad
couldn't have been easy.

262
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,016
And I just wanna say
I'm proud of you.

263
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,600
Well...

264
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,645
if you're so proud...

265
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,815
why don't you gay marry me?

266
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:41,571
You guys, behave! Hit the showers!
Everybody in the showers!

267
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,490
Please, stop hitting each other!
Hit the showers!

268
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:45,782
Cut! Scene!

269
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,454
Shirley, help. I can't control these
drama students or their characters.

270
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:51,331
No! No!

271
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,458
PE is survival of the fittest, Troy.

272
00:13:58,212 --> 00:13:59,797
Hey, your phone's buzzing.

273
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:03,593
It's from Annie. You sly dog.

274
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:07,513
"Need more time.
Keep Pierce busy."

275
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,474
Keep me busy?

276
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:12,852
Look, the group is giving
some big shot a tour...

277
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:16,939
so it's my job to keep you busy.
You know how you get jealous.

278
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,359
So that's why you spent the day
with me?

279
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,695
- You drew the short straw.
- Well, that's how it started...

280
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,989
but I really did end up having
a good time.

281
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:29,327
Yeah, I used to regret not having a son
to bring here.

282
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:35,124
I'm glad I didn't have kids.
They just end up disappointing you.

283
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:45,676
So, Archie, having a good time?
Getting cray up in this club?

284
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,721
Sicker than ever, bro.
I've made my decision, dean.

285
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,224
I'm about to get all up
in this Greendale.

286
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,062
Human Beings, it's official.

287
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:59,565
Say hello to our newest Greendalian,
Archie DeCoste!

288
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,821
- Pop, pop!
- Pop, pop!

289
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:06,739
I want that to be my thing now.

290
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,992
I don't think you can do that.

291
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:16,666
Magnitude, you're not to say
"pop, pop" ever again.

292
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,544
- Not pop?
- That's right. Find a new thing.

293
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,921
Get him out of here.

294
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:24,674
Here we go! We're back!

295
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

296
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,434
Pop, pop!

297
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:43,275
Well, we did it.

298
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:45,736
We did what we had to do
and I feel great about it.

299
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,989
- It's all for Greendale.
- All for Greendale.

300
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,366
You look sad for someone
whose Forensics Club...

301
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,619
can now afford that
state-of-the-art body farm.

302
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,121
I can smell the corpses now.

303
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,290
None of this is weighing on you?

304
00:15:57,582 --> 00:16:00,626
The only thing weighing on me
is tons and tons of whale money.

305
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,753
- Jeffrey.
- Hey. Landed a whale, huh?

306
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,298
Yeah, but I'm starting to feel
like maybe we...

307
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,134
Archie goes to Greendale now.
Moving forward, Annie.

308
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:10,553
We all paid a price.
Don't hear Jeffrey grumbling.

309
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:12,805
And he had to spend a day
with Walking Dead.

310
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,297
- That's true.
- You know what?

311
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:16,309
I can't believe I'm gonna say this.

312
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:18,102
Don't talk about Pierce like that.

313
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,937
Look, maybe the only reason...

314
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:23,232
he can be so unpleasant is
because we expect him to be.

315
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:25,443
If we don't treat him
like such a dick...

316
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,904
Well, he'll still be one
98 percent of the time...

317
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:31,824
but the 2 percent he's tolerable,
it might be worth it.

318
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,413
Who put the salt in his cereal, huh?

319
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:40,333
Look, I for one am still proud of
what we did for Greendale.

320
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:46,589
I've been up all night
trying out new catchphrases.

321
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:51,636
Diggity doo?

322
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,347
My God, what have we done?

323
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:58,142
I thought you dropped PEE.

324
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:01,187
I did, but I lost my keys
in the mocker.

325
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:04,023
I had to hitchhike home last night
in a burrito truck.

326
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:05,525
It's not as fun as it sounds.

327
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,028
- I'm sorry for how I acted in class.
- Don't apologise.

328
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,030
You were the fittest. You survived.

329
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:14,534
Still, no one deserves to be mocked
for being mock-locked...

330
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,244
in a mock locker.

331
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,496
Friends should help friends survive.

332
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:20,998
Oh, jeez! Hi.

333
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:27,672
So I'm gonna help you learn to teach
the most unteachable student there is.

334
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,414
Well done, Coach Barnes.

335
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:03,040
You as well, Coach Bennett.

336
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:06,502
You know, I was supposed to teach
you two to teach other people...

337
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:09,755
but, instead,
you ended up teaching me.

338
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:13,259
I did it.

339
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,595
I used the water fountain.

340
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,724
Archie, wake up.

341
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:22,393
Chillax, bro. It's not even noon.

342
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,770
I will neither chill nor relax.

343
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,523
All this hoopla is not
what Greendale really is.

344
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,735
Greendale is a nice welcome banner.

345
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:33,613
Greendale is a foamless cafeteria.

346
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:38,284
And Greendale is Magnitude saying,
"pop, pop."

347
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:41,746
Now, I am a man of very little integrity
and I let students get away...

348
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,706
with practically anything
on campus.

349
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:48,794
But I will not allow Greendale to lose
the things that make it Greendale.

350
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,297
I would love for you to enroll
in my school...

351
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:53,549
but I will not change it for you.

352
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:58,471
Greendale will stay Greendale,
no matter what.

353
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:03,059
You know what?
Everybody kisses my ass...

354
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:05,144
because my dad is loaded.

355
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:09,482
And they always give me free stuff,
like that Jet Ski I sunk.

356
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:12,818
But it would be pretty sweet
to be treated like a normal dude.

357
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,488
So I'm in.

358
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:21,827
Magnitude. You usually have
the perfect blend of brevity and wit...

359
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,163
that sums up situations like this.

360
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,123
Pop, pop!

361
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,336
- Oh, that's so good!
- So good!

362
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:34,632
I think we all learned today that
all human beings deserve dignity.

363
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:38,344
Delta Cubes, Delta Cubes,
Delta Cubes!

364
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:42,056
Delta Cubes, Delta Cubes,
Delta Cubes!

365
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,350
Delta Cubes,
Operation Slack Attack.

366
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:46,352
- Slack Attack?
- Oh, yeah.

367
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,438
Delta Cubes, Delta Cubes...

368
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:53,526
Mark my words, Delta Cubes,
you'll pay for this!

369
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,329
- Is this seat taken?
- Free country.

370
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:13,796
You know, I was thinking...

371
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:16,757
I might start coming here
more often.

372
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,510
I like the vibe.

373
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,642
You know what sport I never got?
Golf.

374
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:29,812
No argument here.

375
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:32,189
They lost me immediately
with the clown clothes.

376
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:35,484
You know, I belong to a dozen
country clubs. Never played.

377
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,403
I just hit on the waitresses.

378
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:39,780
Something about
a country club waitress...

379
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,700
that just makes you wanna
pay your dues every year.

380
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,888
Get your damn hand off of my Let's.

381
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,768
Honestly, after all that,
you still eat Splingles?

382
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,645
Yeah, Troy. Splingles have
30 percent less fat.

383
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,731
They're the fit chip.

384
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:17,067
You know, I kind of have a headache.
Maybe you should go home.

384
00:21:18,305 --> 00:21:24,481
