1
00:00:02,091 --> 00:00:06,275
Hi, everybody. I'm Jeff.
Uhm... Mr. Winger.

2
00:00:06,294 --> 00:00:10,231
And this is Fundamentals of Law.

3
00:00:13,891 --> 00:00:15,257
Any questions?

4
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:17,379
You, Red Hair. I'm not
gonna learn names.

5
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:19,403
- Will there be a syllabus?
- "Will there be a syllabus?"

6
00:00:19,417 --> 00:00:22,327
Is good example of a question.
Moving on.

7
00:00:22,341 --> 00:00:24,175
- Ski Cap.
- How are we gonna be graded?

8
00:00:24,193 --> 00:00:26,327
Oh, no spoilers, Ski Cap.

9
00:00:27,971 --> 00:00:29,722
- Maybe we better do names.
- Dave.

10
00:00:29,756 --> 00:00:31,539
What percent of our grade
will the final be?

11
00:00:31,561 --> 00:00:34,460
Come on, guys, percentages,
grades, that syllabus thing...

12
00:00:34,466 --> 00:00:37,652
Are we human beings or just
question-and-answer machines?

13
00:00:38,106 --> 00:00:42,143
We're students.
And you're a teacher.

14
00:00:43,338 --> 00:00:44,765
Yeah.

15
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,746
I'm a teacher.

16
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,337
Did you see that? That
teacher just leered at me.

17
00:00:54,365 --> 00:00:56,026
- Ew.
- Hey, look,

18
00:00:56,045 --> 00:00:58,122
it's the star of "Head of the Ass."

19
00:00:58,149 --> 00:00:59,969
Shut up, Leonard!
Nice earring.

20
00:00:59,982 --> 00:01:02,103
You look like the road manager
for the California Raisins.

21
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:05,424
Whoa! What kind of teacher
talks to a student like that?

22
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:07,141
- Right?
- Yeah.

23
00:01:14,078 --> 00:01:17,353
- Fresh meat, huh?
- Yeah, Jeff Winger, law.

24
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,414
Buzz Hickey, criminology.

25
00:01:20,426 --> 00:01:22,757
You can have that half of the
office, but come spring,

26
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:25,721
that corner is stacked to the
rafters with fetal pigs.

27
00:01:25,734 --> 00:01:28,498
I won't be here that long. This is
sort of a temporary gig for me.

28
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:29,597
Mm, I get it.

29
00:01:29,634 --> 00:01:32,540
Teaching to make ends meet
until a real job comes along,

30
00:01:32,558 --> 00:01:35,225
- yeah, me too.
- Oh, cool. How long have you been...

31
00:01:35,245 --> 00:01:36,932
15 years.

32
00:01:38,656 --> 00:01:40,977
15 years and counting.

33
00:01:41,473 --> 00:01:43,298
"Temporary gig."

34
00:01:43,966 --> 00:01:46,353
Oh, I like you.

44
00:02:12,088 --> 00:02:15,235
Oh, the new table
turned out great, Abed.

45
00:02:15,262 --> 00:02:16,812
Splendid varnishing.

46
00:02:16,864 --> 00:02:18,977
- "Table Mark II"?
- I added that,

47
00:02:19,002 --> 00:02:21,354
and a few custom upgrades.
It's voice activated.

48
00:02:21,401 --> 00:02:23,141
Table, resume table mode.

49
00:02:23,424 --> 00:02:25,538
- Huh?
- Oh.

50
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,998
Table, power down.

51
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:29,054
Wait! I got a cup on there.

52
00:02:29,074 --> 00:02:31,173
- Oh, teacher man!
- Ee!

53
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:33,079
It's Professor Winger!

54
00:02:33,106 --> 00:02:35,343
Please don't razz me
about being a teacher.

55
00:02:35,368 --> 00:02:38,088
Teaching is the most noble
profession in the world.

56
00:02:38,108 --> 00:02:39,879
Yeah, tell that to the guy
that shares my office.

57
00:02:39,918 --> 00:02:41,359
He fixes cuckoo clocks for fun.

58
00:02:41,385 --> 00:02:44,079
Ugh. That sounds like Mr. Hickey,
my criminology professor.

59
00:02:44,091 --> 00:02:46,256
I certainly hope you'll be
a better teacher than him.

60
00:02:46,276 --> 00:02:47,829
Annie, I don't know law.

61
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,734
I wasn't a real lawyer, remember?

62
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:51,920
I can't just pretend I'm teaching.

63
00:02:51,942 --> 00:02:53,902
I'm not Mythbusters.

64
00:02:53,914 --> 00:02:56,087
There's a two-day course called
"Nicolas Cage: Good or Bad."

65
00:02:56,114 --> 00:02:58,503
I'm signing up. I've
always wanted to know.

66
00:02:58,537 --> 00:03:00,587
Nicolas Cage is one of pop
culture's greatest mysteries.

67
00:03:00,609 --> 00:03:02,212
Oh, there's a course
on Nicolas Cage,

68
00:03:02,225 --> 00:03:04,590
but if you mention Jesus to your science
teacher, you get a written warning.

69
00:03:04,615 --> 00:03:05,889
Well, Jesus wasn't in 70 movies.

70
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,610
I'm in. Cage class, sounds fun.

71
00:03:07,623 --> 00:03:09,530
Jeff, you don't have time
to take a blow-off class.

72
00:03:09,555 --> 00:03:11,776
You need to figure out what
you're gonna teach your students.

73
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,828
Thanks, Annie, for one glorious
second, I forgot I was a teacher.

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,948
Oh! Look at Mr. Smarty Pants!

75
00:03:46,003 --> 00:03:49,463
I am so excited! Jeff is gonna
help me save the school.

76
00:03:49,484 --> 00:03:52,713
Not all by himself.
I am learning Excel.

77
00:03:52,741 --> 00:03:54,437
- Jeff, do you know Excel?
- No.

78
00:03:54,457 --> 00:03:57,287
Well, it looks like you do.

79
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,751
Yay, teaching!

80
00:04:02,396 --> 00:04:06,820
I, as you know, am dramatic
professor Sean Garrity,

81
00:04:06,826 --> 00:04:09,901
and you are now embarking
on an odyssey of discussion

82
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,667
about an actor
who keeps the world asking:

83
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:14,949
Nicolas Cage, good or bad?

84
00:04:14,975 --> 00:04:16,055
Yes, young man?

85
00:04:16,077 --> 00:04:18,550
- So you don't know?
- Mr. Nadir.

86
00:04:18,576 --> 00:04:21,817
Mr. Nadir drove our
TV Studies professor

87
00:04:21,836 --> 00:04:24,846
out of his mind by proving
that there was an answer

88
00:04:24,867 --> 00:04:26,439
to the question "Who's the Boss?"

89
00:04:26,451 --> 00:04:29,317
- Angela.
- I admire your brain, Mr. Nadir.

90
00:04:29,343 --> 00:04:32,872
I did not admire
Professor Sheffield,

91
00:04:33,403 --> 00:04:36,569
but I promise you, this
question has no answer.

92
00:04:37,048 --> 00:04:42,266
Your homework is to watch five Nicolas
Cage films by Wednesday, no marathons.

93
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:44,033
Space out your viewings.

94
00:04:44,045 --> 00:04:45,915
Five, that's it?

95
00:04:46,146 --> 00:04:47,978
Be careful, Abed Nadir.

96
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:51,336
Promise me you will be careful.

97
00:04:52,072 --> 00:04:54,350
I have no idea how to
make a curriculum.

98
00:04:54,369 --> 00:04:56,713
Becoming a teacher
was a huge mistake.

99
00:04:56,733 --> 00:04:58,677
Without a doubt.

100
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:01,740
That said, there
are certain perks.

101
00:05:01,764 --> 00:05:03,016
- Excuse me.
- Wow.

102
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:04,649
I didn't know teachers
could cut in line.

103
00:05:04,668 --> 00:05:07,041
I can actually experience this
food warm and disgusting.

104
00:05:07,067 --> 00:05:09,168
Winger, what are you doing?

105
00:05:09,187 --> 00:05:12,572
This line is for food, not
for Lionel Richie tickets.

106
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,747
This is my house.

107
00:05:16,187 --> 00:05:17,567
Come here.

108
00:05:18,278 --> 00:05:21,463
This man's name is Mr. Winger,

109
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:25,348
and Mr. Winger is a teacher.

110
00:05:25,598 --> 00:05:27,437
You know what that means?

111
00:05:28,072 --> 00:05:30,670
It means he gets your meatballs.

112
00:05:31,704 --> 00:05:33,351
Ah, please.

113
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:35,749
That's all I have.

114
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:39,584
Get outta here.

115
00:05:40,252 --> 00:05:42,646
Place is a zoo. The trick is,

116
00:05:42,665 --> 00:05:45,579
you gotta show the other baboons
you got a bigger, redder ass.

117
00:05:45,598 --> 00:05:46,951
Let's hit the lounge.

118
00:05:49,913 --> 00:05:51,461
Whoa.

119
00:05:52,382 --> 00:05:55,375
Everybody, this is
the new guy, Winger.

120
00:05:55,401 --> 00:05:58,846
He's having trouble
planning his curriculum.

121
00:06:00,177 --> 00:06:01,658
What?

122
00:06:02,357 --> 00:06:04,108
Here's all you need to know...

123
00:06:04,134 --> 00:06:06,620
Break into groups, grade
each other's papers,

124
00:06:06,641 --> 00:06:09,274
and please enjoy the seven-disc
edition of Planet Earth.

125
00:06:10,047 --> 00:06:14,067
Yoo-hoo! Is there a
Mr. Winger in here?

126
00:06:14,112 --> 00:06:16,678
Jeffrey, we need to carve out
some time to learn Excel.

127
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:18,605
Do you guys know Excel?
I'm learning.

128
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:21,475
You know the rules, Pelton.
Drop the checks and move on.

129
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:24,211
Oh. Jeffrey, I'm gonna boot up my
computer and download the tutor...

130
00:06:26,194 --> 00:06:28,274
- What was that about?
- Union rules.

131
00:06:28,302 --> 00:06:31,180
Management's not allowed
in the faculty lounge.

132
00:06:31,737 --> 00:06:33,403
I could get used to this.

133
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,512
Nicolas Cage is so weird.

134
00:06:42,531 --> 00:06:46,057
I mean, he seemed scared to smell
that flower but happy to get shot.

135
00:06:46,086 --> 00:06:48,084
He's a complex performer.
He'll give you The Rock,

136
00:06:48,098 --> 00:06:50,298
Con Air, then Face/Off,
and you think you understand,

137
00:06:50,322 --> 00:06:52,362
but then Windtalkers, Guarding
Tess, The Wicker Man.

138
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,896
He begs you to stop
watching, but you can't.

139
00:06:56,177 --> 00:06:58,463
That was an odd choice.

140
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,971
Would you say it was
odd good or odd bad?

141
00:06:59,983 --> 00:07:01,555
Maybe he's just good
in good movies

142
00:07:01,564 --> 00:07:03,916
and then acts crazy in crap
to make drug money.

143
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,338
But is he good, or is he bad?
Every actor is something.

144
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,529
Robert Downey Jr., good,
Jim Belushi, bad.

145
00:07:08,548 --> 00:07:11,305
Van Damme, the good kind of bad,
Johnny Depp, the bad kind of good.

146
00:07:11,327 --> 00:07:13,696
There's a spectrum,
and Cage is on it.

147
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:15,451
I just have to find him.

148
00:07:15,495 --> 00:07:18,048
- I'm gonna go check on Jeff.
- Oh.

149
00:07:19,665 --> 00:07:23,427
- Hello. - Hey, Jeff, how's
the old curriculum going?

150
00:07:23,446 --> 00:07:26,360
Great. Consider our nation's
youth pre-inspired.

151
00:07:26,374 --> 00:07:27,994
- Want a refill, Winger?
- Mm.

152
00:07:28,016 --> 00:07:29,317
- Is that Hickey?
- Yeah.

153
00:07:29,338 --> 00:07:30,617
We're working on syllabuses.

154
00:07:30,637 --> 00:07:33,367
Hey, let's turd some lockers!

155
00:07:34,394 --> 00:07:35,933
Gotta go! Teacher thing!

156
00:07:36,548 --> 00:07:38,795
It's "syllabi."

157
00:07:39,014 --> 00:07:41,566
Guterman. Droppin' mad science?

158
00:07:41,581 --> 00:07:44,737
Ooh, Elaine, take it easy
on the Oxford commas.

159
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:47,370
Hey, walk, don't run, mister!
This isn't a racetrack!

160
00:07:47,396 --> 00:07:50,240
Okay, dangerous minds,
let's break into groups,

161
00:07:50,268 --> 00:07:53,762
discuss chapter one,
and if you are lucky,

162
00:07:53,836 --> 00:07:56,175
we might sneak in
a little Planet Earth.

163
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:57,519
Any questions?

164
00:07:57,536 --> 00:07:58,944
Ahem.

165
00:07:59,468 --> 00:08:01,119
Just a few.

166
00:08:02,286 --> 00:08:06,026
Ahh, she in your class, yo!

167
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:14,151
So, I guess... Uh... Just...

168
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:15,923
Read chapter one...

169
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,293
And memorize the federal
rules of civil procedure.

170
00:08:18,312 --> 00:08:19,947
Class dismissed.

171
00:08:20,185 --> 00:08:22,069
Not so fast, Jeff.

172
00:08:26,136 --> 00:08:28,447
I assume you know why I'm
keeping you after class.

173
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:31,456
Not really. Ski Cap and White
Dave got lots of stuff wrong too.

174
00:08:31,475 --> 00:08:33,267
- You're the teacher, Jeff.
- You don't have to rub it in.

175
00:08:33,277 --> 00:08:35,760
What I saw today was embarrassing.

176
00:08:36,413 --> 00:08:38,899
You were late, you
clearly had no idea...

177
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:40,221
Hey!

178
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,304
You had no idea what
Tort Reform meant,

179
00:08:42,311 --> 00:08:44,104
and when I asked you to
explain the Sixth Amendment,

180
00:08:44,116 --> 00:08:45,533
- you pled the Fifth!
- I know my rights.

181
00:08:45,546 --> 00:08:47,730
No, you don't.
That's the problem.

182
00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:53,884
Here.
I gathered some materials.

183
00:08:53,897 --> 00:08:55,549
Tomorrow morning, before class,

184
00:08:55,572 --> 00:08:57,559
I need to verify that you
know enough to teach.

185
00:08:57,581 --> 00:08:59,702
You're gonna quiz me?
You're the worst.

186
00:08:59,716 --> 00:09:02,071
I wish Troy was in my
class instead of you!

187
00:09:02,304 --> 00:09:03,955
I hate her, I hate her,
I hate her, I hate her,

188
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:05,727
I hate her, I hate her, I hate her,
I hate her, I hate her.

189
00:09:05,755 --> 00:09:08,796
Hey, wait, I warned you
to separate these worlds.

190
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:11,754
She's lead, we're chalk.

191
00:09:13,222 --> 00:09:15,514
She needs to be taken out.

192
00:09:16,662 --> 00:09:19,330
Of your class.
I say minus her.

193
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,030
- Minus her?
- Give her A-minuses.

194
00:09:21,051 --> 00:09:23,977
- It'll drive her nuts, she'll drop.
- She'll call me on it. She'll report me.

195
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,860
Teachers don't have to
explain minuses.

196
00:09:25,868 --> 00:09:27,908
Why do you think
we invented 'em?

197
00:09:27,977 --> 00:09:29,933
- She's my friend.
- Eh.

198
00:09:29,947 --> 00:09:32,902
You like the Leonard Meatballs?
They added something special.

199
00:09:37,727 --> 00:09:39,662
It's Leonard.

200
00:09:43,169 --> 00:09:45,826
Come on, I'm just
messing with you.

201
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:48,090
You done with your bit?
I'd like my earring back.

202
00:09:48,115 --> 00:09:49,123
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

203
00:09:49,147 --> 00:09:52,038
Go get your earring,
you piece of human garbage.

204
00:10:00,657 --> 00:10:02,037
Uh...

205
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,952
Oh, my God.

206
00:10:07,511 --> 00:10:09,051
Okay, hey,
I have a working theory,

207
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:10,850
and don't react until you've
heard the whole thing.

208
00:10:10,864 --> 00:10:13,149
If you watch closely, at the
seven-minute mark in Snake Eyes,

209
00:10:13,169 --> 00:10:14,715
you'll notice the moment
where an alien arm

210
00:10:14,735 --> 00:10:17,644
- could've come up and...
- Abed, this isn't worth it.

211
00:10:17,885 --> 00:10:21,495
Maybe Nicolas Cage is just...
crazy.

212
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,962
All actors are crazy, Annie.
Some crazy actors are good,

213
00:10:23,981 --> 00:10:25,354
some are bad, but none
of them are neither.

214
00:10:25,393 --> 00:10:26,932
There's no such thing as
both, so which one is...

215
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,432
Nicolas Cage, huh? Oh! Oh!

216
00:10:33,761 --> 00:10:35,797
Okay, so break into groups,

217
00:10:35,817 --> 00:10:38,409
and then, you guys
quiz each other.

218
00:10:38,447 --> 00:10:41,673
Mr. Winger, is that really
the best use of our time?

219
00:10:41,691 --> 00:10:43,582
Seems like the value
of having you here is...

220
00:10:43,595 --> 00:10:46,384
I think my value as a teacher
is to teach you how to learn.

221
00:10:46,403 --> 00:10:48,010
I think you're telling us
we should teach ourselves.

222
00:10:48,024 --> 00:10:49,638
I don't think you're gonna learn
if I tell you how to think.

223
00:10:49,662 --> 00:10:51,336
I think if you tell us what you
think, then we'll learn that.

224
00:10:51,361 --> 00:10:53,562
I thought you should break into
groups, but you failed to learn that,

225
00:10:53,581 --> 00:10:54,868
so your theory's invalid.

226
00:10:56,527 --> 00:10:58,263
Ooh, snap.

227
00:11:00,532 --> 00:11:01,827
Break into groups.

228
00:11:01,847 --> 00:11:04,243
Mr. Winger, how did you do that?

229
00:11:04,255 --> 00:11:06,982
- Do what? - You won an
argument against Annie Edison.

230
00:11:07,003 --> 00:11:08,875
You don't argue with
Annie, Garrett,

231
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:10,975
you let her argue with
herself until she loses.

232
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,607
- You can win by not arguing?
- Yeah, Ski Cap.

233
00:11:13,634 --> 00:11:15,453
Anyone that tries to
argue has already lost,

234
00:11:15,471 --> 00:11:17,491
because they pick
an argument to lose.

235
00:11:17,528 --> 00:11:19,455
I mean, that's why
I never lost a case.

236
00:11:19,466 --> 00:11:22,760
Prosecutors beat themselves,
because they d... Here.

237
00:11:23,009 --> 00:11:26,135
Because they draw a circle

238
00:11:26,408 --> 00:11:28,821
around something called
"The Truth,"

239
00:11:28,846 --> 00:11:31,961
and they say that everything
outside it is a lie.

240
00:11:33,049 --> 00:11:34,393
Annie,

241
00:11:34,584 --> 00:11:36,928
don't cry, you were right.

242
00:11:36,956 --> 00:11:38,789
I actually might enjoy teaching.

243
00:11:38,812 --> 00:11:41,351
I'm not crying because of you.

244
00:11:41,388 --> 00:11:43,644
I got this from Professor Hickey.

245
00:11:43,663 --> 00:11:45,567
What the hell? He
gave you a dead rat?

246
00:11:45,596 --> 00:11:47,779
No, this is my witness
intimidation project.

247
00:11:47,801 --> 00:11:49,797
He gave me this.

248
00:11:49,821 --> 00:11:53,503
- A-minus. - I guess I
overextended my schedule.

249
00:11:53,841 --> 00:11:56,722
I'm sorry, Jeff. I have
to drop your class.

250
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:00,857
Okay, thoughts on Nicolas Cage.

251
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:03,587
I think he's a genius. I mean, he
keeps getting hired for some reason,

252
00:12:03,594 --> 00:12:05,089
and it's not because
of his hair.

253
00:12:05,118 --> 00:12:07,995
I don't know, if I was in
70 films over 30 years,

254
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,234
and I spent each one
talking at random volumes,

255
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,164
I might accidentally
win an Oscar.

256
00:12:12,171 --> 00:12:14,738
I think our opinions about
pop culture are fed to us

257
00:12:14,754 --> 00:12:18,248
- by machines designed to criminalize
human autonomy. - Good one.

258
00:12:21,235 --> 00:12:22,302
Dear God.

259
00:12:22,336 --> 00:12:23,827
- Abed.
- No, stand back.

260
00:12:23,847 --> 00:12:25,456
Give him space.

261
00:12:30,397 --> 00:12:32,389
Nicolas Cage, good or bad.

262
00:12:32,804 --> 00:12:36,863
A challenge, certainly,
but not unsolvable,

263
00:12:37,133 --> 00:12:40,981
because all actors have distinct
values, which I use to find answers.

264
00:12:41,001 --> 00:12:43,883
Abed, how much Nicolas
Cage did you...

265
00:12:43,898 --> 00:12:45,414
Enough!

266
00:12:46,976 --> 00:12:50,245
I watched enough to find...
the answers.

267
00:12:51,099 --> 00:12:53,969
Because this...
this is my reality,

268
00:12:53,988 --> 00:12:57,428
this is how I learned to be, and my
being doesn't allow for Nicolas...

269
00:12:57,437 --> 00:12:59,990
Freaking Cage, okay?

270
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:01,921
Oh, yeah!

271
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:05,769
Yeah! Oh! Oh!

272
00:13:12,763 --> 00:13:15,600
Oh, I'm a cat.
I'm a sexy cat.

273
00:13:18,371 --> 00:13:21,571
Oh! Oh! Oh!

274
00:13:21,597 --> 00:13:24,517
O-o-ohh!

275
00:13:32,413 --> 00:13:37,703
Abed? Think of something safe like
Holly Hunter, or Don Cheadle!

276
00:13:38,334 --> 00:13:40,177
Abed? Abed!

277
00:13:43,878 --> 00:13:45,471
That was brilliant.

278
00:13:48,616 --> 00:13:50,024
You gave Annie an A-minus?

279
00:13:50,051 --> 00:13:51,798
How could you? What
were you thinking?

280
00:13:51,835 --> 00:13:54,270
- Are you drawing a peanut?
- It's a duck,

281
00:13:54,296 --> 00:13:56,080
and it's none of your
concern, actually.

282
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,456
Are you trying to cartoon?

283
00:13:57,475 --> 00:13:59,975
Trying and succeeding.
State your business.

284
00:13:59,988 --> 00:14:03,842
I want to know what kind of monster
minuses the best student in his class.

285
00:14:03,863 --> 00:14:04,990
I'm a monster?

286
00:14:05,009 --> 00:14:08,123
I was in the storm drain lair
of the Black River Ripper.

287
00:14:08,135 --> 00:14:11,419
I have seen human heads used
for things other than heads,

288
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:14,951
so best not be calling
me a monster.

289
00:14:14,957 --> 00:14:17,136
Okay, you're a bad teacher.

290
00:14:17,164 --> 00:14:19,511
- I got her off your back.
- I was handling it.

291
00:14:19,528 --> 00:14:21,885
Unlike you, I know how
to engage my students.

292
00:14:21,897 --> 00:14:25,250
I mean, I may not love teaching, but
I did fool around with it today,

293
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:27,222
and I may hook up with it again
a few more times

294
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,932
even if I do dump it
right before Christmas.

295
00:14:28,966 --> 00:14:31,846
- We do not work for them.
- Maybe we do.

296
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,465
That does not count
as an argument.

297
00:14:33,484 --> 00:14:36,184
Yeah, well, drawing ducks
doesn't count as cartooning!

298
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:40,491
It's one duck, his name is Jim,
and publishers are interested!

299
00:14:41,309 --> 00:14:43,614
Miss Edison, good news.

300
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:46,926
I talked to Professor Hickey and it
turns out your project was an "A."

301
00:14:46,946 --> 00:14:49,336
You used your connections
to change my grade?

302
00:14:49,363 --> 00:14:51,797
No, an A-minus means
you actually earned an "A,"

303
00:14:51,818 --> 00:14:53,118
but the teacher doesn't like you.

304
00:14:53,136 --> 00:14:55,341
- It's a secret faculty thing.
- What?

305
00:14:55,359 --> 00:14:57,792
- Are you kidding?
- Et tu, Brute?

306
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,759
Am I using that right?

307
00:14:58,783 --> 00:15:01,495
I've been busting my
butt for five years,

308
00:15:01,523 --> 00:15:05,985
and the whole thing comes down to a
few old losers' petty insecurities?

309
00:15:06,004 --> 00:15:08,384
- Oligarchy!
- Et tu, Brute!

310
00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:11,422
- We've got to tell people!
- Mm.

311
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:14,039
Minuses are made up!

312
00:15:15,433 --> 00:15:18,231
It's riot time! Yeah!

313
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:20,924
Ugh! Bring me their heads!

314
00:15:22,894 --> 00:15:25,229
Pop pop!

315
00:15:31,817 --> 00:15:35,697
Abed? I couldn't find you
at school, so I got worried.

316
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:38,356
You're throwing away all
your little movies, why?

317
00:15:38,383 --> 00:15:40,096
They have no value anymore.

318
00:15:40,133 --> 00:15:43,037
Well, if you're looking for
something to believe in,

319
00:15:43,056 --> 00:15:46,912
I know a skinny, little Hebrew
handyman you could meet.

320
00:15:46,948 --> 00:15:50,177
I'm not going to become Christian,
Shirley, or a better Muslim.

321
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:51,565
This was my religion.

322
00:15:51,571 --> 00:15:53,640
I thought the meaning of
people was somewhere in here.

323
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:56,294
Then I looked inside Nicolas
Cage and I found a secret.

324
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,019
People are random and pointless.

325
00:15:58,048 --> 00:16:00,202
Well, in my religion,
the whole point

326
00:16:00,216 --> 00:16:02,157
is that you can't understand
every little thing,

327
00:16:02,177 --> 00:16:04,744
and you know, there's a word
for people who remind you

328
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:07,230
that you're not God, and invite
you to try a little harder.

329
00:16:07,256 --> 00:16:09,927
Prophets, messiahs,
kung fu pandas.

330
00:16:10,754 --> 00:16:12,754
- So Nicolas Cage is Jesus?
- Uh, no,

331
00:16:12,774 --> 00:16:15,096
but he clearly works
in mysterious ways,

332
00:16:15,115 --> 00:16:18,051
and maybe that's just his job.

333
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:20,567
And that's why critics can
call him a genius or an idiot

334
00:16:20,586 --> 00:16:21,662
and be right no matter what.

335
00:16:21,686 --> 00:16:24,717
A demon to some and an angel
to others, like a cenobite.

336
00:16:24,974 --> 00:16:26,221
Excuse me, did you say cenobite?

337
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,847
Yeah, you know, cenobite,
like from Hellraiser.

338
00:16:27,864 --> 00:16:30,524
You like Hellraiser? You
know the word "Hellraiser"?

339
00:16:30,567 --> 00:16:34,368
I thought pinhead in space was a bit
of a letdown, but I'm in for the ride.

340
00:16:38,028 --> 00:16:40,205
Rise up, Greendale!

341
00:16:40,225 --> 00:16:42,432
Your teachers have
been lying to you!

342
00:16:42,457 --> 00:16:46,270
You deserve slightly
higher grades!

343
00:16:46,308 --> 00:16:49,119
Slightly higher grades!
Slightly higher grades!

344
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:51,686
The whole world is watching this!

345
00:16:51,706 --> 00:16:53,075
- Yeah!
- Oh, wait.

346
00:16:53,087 --> 00:16:54,268
I'm out of data minutes.

347
00:16:54,288 --> 00:16:58,259
The whole world will be watching
this on the first of next month!

348
00:16:58,284 --> 00:17:01,429
Slightly higher grades!
Slightly higher grades!

349
00:17:01,462 --> 00:17:03,702
- Jeffrey, do something!
- Slightly higher grades.

350
00:17:03,711 --> 00:17:05,077
Distract them.
Take your shirt off!

351
00:17:05,115 --> 00:17:07,584
- Here.
- Slightly higher grades!

352
00:17:07,615 --> 00:17:11,273
- Slightly higher grades!
- Everybody, calm down! Just listen!

353
00:17:11,295 --> 00:17:14,117
Do you think the students
and teachers at Harvard

354
00:17:14,144 --> 00:17:18,586
are at each other's throats?
No, because they're all rich.

355
00:17:18,615 --> 00:17:21,015
We all have something
in common too.

356
00:17:21,037 --> 00:17:23,517
We all suck.

357
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,288
We're all broke.

358
00:17:25,301 --> 00:17:27,655
We all just went
through an entire week

359
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:30,431
of meatball lunches
without even blinking.

360
00:17:30,461 --> 00:17:31,928
Oh, that's on me.

361
00:17:31,953 --> 00:17:33,806
I converted the lunch menu
to a spreadsheet.

362
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:36,579
The teachers here
are teachers here

363
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:41,277
because they did something
wrong, same as the students.

364
00:17:41,305 --> 00:17:45,778
So get on the same team,
because, take it from me,

365
00:17:45,805 --> 00:17:50,708
those of us that get to leave
aren't going anywhere.

366
00:17:53,788 --> 00:17:55,613
- Boo!
- No, you suck!

367
00:17:55,813 --> 00:17:56,673
Ugh!

368
00:17:56,683 --> 00:17:58,923
Jeffrey, go with my
"take off your shirt" plan!

369
00:17:58,936 --> 00:18:02,990
May I point out that you're
doing this together?

370
00:18:03,259 --> 00:18:06,730
It's all based on rows
and columns of cells.

371
00:18:06,743 --> 00:18:08,369
I think that's why
the call it "Excel."

372
00:18:08,393 --> 00:18:09,353
- I don't care.
- Mm-kay,

373
00:18:09,376 --> 00:18:13,333
now, I know it's unrealistic to think
that we can eliminate riots completely,

374
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:15,383
but I have been
crunching the numbers,

375
00:18:15,403 --> 00:18:17,516
and I believe we can
reduce them by 40%.

376
00:18:17,538 --> 00:18:20,202
Let's hope the man doesn't target
you for dreaming this big.

377
00:18:20,229 --> 00:18:21,672
Here's my plan.

378
00:18:21,691 --> 00:18:24,940
You know that "Save Greendale"
committee you pretended to form?

379
00:18:24,972 --> 00:18:26,756
We need one of those for real.

380
00:18:26,778 --> 00:18:30,449
I want a student/teacher
alliance, with you in charge.

381
00:18:30,469 --> 00:18:32,316
- I vote myself out.
- You don't have a quorum.

382
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:37,676
And don't forget, if I fire you, you're
likely starve and die, so you know.

383
00:18:37,724 --> 00:18:39,164
Do you want me
to cut your meatball?

384
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,820
All right, look,

385
00:18:44,398 --> 00:18:46,832
there are two things
I don't do well,

386
00:18:46,864 --> 00:18:49,415
apologies and
drawing duck bills.

387
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:51,930
I lost perspective.
Students aren't the enemy,

388
00:18:51,955 --> 00:18:55,516
and, I don't know, maybe
my bills are a little pointy.

389
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,742
Maybe I'm basing them on beaks.

390
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,968
- Apologize to Annie.
- I did, I gave her an "A."

391
00:19:01,818 --> 00:19:04,159
I don't know how else
to make it right.

392
00:19:04,979 --> 00:19:08,488
Oh. I guess, I don't
know, I quit.

393
00:19:11,311 --> 00:19:12,801
I got a better idea.

394
00:19:12,826 --> 00:19:17,619
As our first order of business for the
student/teacher Save Greendale Committee,

395
00:19:17,647 --> 00:19:21,295
we hereby ban the Dean from
attending future meetings.

396
00:19:21,457 --> 00:19:23,829
- Yeah.
- Our second order of business...

397
00:19:23,851 --> 00:19:25,992
- Lunch.
- Yeah.

398
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:42,127
I'm taste-testing rations
for the shelter I'm digging.

399
00:19:42,421 --> 00:19:44,228
Are you the coolest
person in the world?

400
00:19:44,257 --> 00:19:45,634
I doubt it.

401
00:19:45,653 --> 00:19:47,116
I would like to address
the fact that there are

402
00:19:47,136 --> 00:19:49,314
no Asian-Americans
represented here.

403
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,580
We can get Chang.

404
00:19:50,602 --> 00:19:53,962
No need to rush into anything,
I just wanted to address it.

405
00:19:54,142 --> 00:19:55,991
Anybody want some nuts?

406
00:19:57,338 --> 00:20:00,276
__

407
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,880
__

408
00:20:02,933 --> 00:20:07,550
__

409
00:20:08,769 --> 00:20:11,621
__

410
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:14,737
__

411
00:20:21,741 --> 00:20:24,826
- Quiet, I think he's just coming.
- This is gonna be hilarious.

412
00:20:35,474 --> 00:20:37,375
Yeah, pharmacy please.

413
00:20:38,292 --> 00:20:40,516
Yeah, this is Buzz Hickey.

414
00:20:40,526 --> 00:20:44,417
I think you gave me the wrong
medication. I usually get Lipitor.

415
00:20:44,865 --> 00:20:47,898
What do you mean my insurance
won't cover it anymore?

416
00:20:47,925 --> 00:20:51,304
My body doesn't respond well
to the generic stuff.

417
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:54,853
Let me ask you a question, lady,
can you pay out of pocket?

418
00:20:54,883 --> 00:20:59,141
I'm an educator, ma'am,
living on a teacher's salary!

419
00:20:59,366 --> 00:21:02,829
No, I-I'm sorry.
What's your name?

420
00:21:03,275 --> 00:21:07,222
Leia, well, let me tell
you something, Leia,

421
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:10,086
I wake up every night screaming.

422
00:21:10,112 --> 00:21:13,126
Life is unfair, but it's
the only thing we g...

423
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:16,135
Yeah, yeah. Yeah,
I'll call back later.

424
00:21:22,423 --> 00:21:25,134
Mom, it's Buzz. I'm gonna
say this as fast as I can.

425
00:21:25,156 --> 00:21:28,009
We can't afford to bury dad
with the rest of the family.

426
00:21:29,195 --> 00:21:35,332
