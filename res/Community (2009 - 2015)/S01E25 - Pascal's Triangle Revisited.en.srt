1
00:00:11,212 --> 00:00:12,181
- Thanks for a great year.
- You got it.

2
00:00:12,849 --> 00:00:13,950
Mr. Winger!

3
00:00:14,518 --> 00:00:16,653
I hope you will be seizing
the day this summer.

4
00:00:16,721 --> 00:00:18,121
Thanks, Professor Whitman.

5
00:00:18,189 --> 00:00:20,491
And I hope you'll be seizing
a more contemporary movie.

6
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:22,393
Looking good, Leonard.

7
00:00:22,461 --> 00:00:23,661
Stroke or tai chi?

8
00:00:23,729 --> 00:00:24,796
Tai chi.

9
00:00:24,863 --> 00:00:26,164
Keep it up.

10
00:00:26,231 --> 00:00:29,035
And keep up whatever
it is you're doing, Garrett.

11
00:00:29,103 --> 00:00:30,903
It's called "chillaxing".

12
00:00:30,971 --> 00:00:31,972
Duh!

13
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:33,940
Hey... hey, what's up, Jeff? Hi.

14
00:00:34,008 --> 00:00:36,443
Hello, good morning, howdy.

15
00:00:36,511 --> 00:00:38,280
Wait, Jeff. I'll walk with you.

16
00:00:42,418 --> 00:00:43,651
Uh...

17
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:46,054
I got class in, like, five hours, so...

18
00:00:46,122 --> 00:00:47,522
All right, I'll see you, babe.

19
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:48,590
Sayonara.

20
00:00:48,658 --> 00:00:49,858
I can't believe I made it

21
00:00:49,926 --> 00:00:51,359
through my first year of college.

22
00:00:51,427 --> 00:00:52,527
I finally get to click send

23
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,362
on so many "I told you so" emails.

24
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,630
Yeah, it's pretty great.
Not much could ruin today.

25
00:00:56,698 --> 00:00:57,865
Hi!

26
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:59,566
Oh, shoot. I forgot saying
that summons him.

27
00:00:59,634 --> 00:01:00,801
Will you two be attending

28
00:01:00,868 --> 00:01:02,802
tomorrow's, uh, transfer
ceremony to send off

29
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:05,472
all the students leaving
for so-called real schools?

30
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,275
There's a formal dance afterward.

31
00:01:07,343 --> 00:01:09,678
How many dances is
this school gonna have?

32
00:01:09,745 --> 00:01:10,979
Five.

33
00:01:11,047 --> 00:01:13,816
If you come to all of them,
you get one of these.

34
00:01:13,884 --> 00:01:15,985
I assumed your whole posse
would be coming to the dance,

35
00:01:16,053 --> 00:01:17,988
having heard the exciting
news about Britta.

36
00:01:19,491 --> 00:01:21,158
Banana rhino.

37
00:01:21,226 --> 00:01:23,661
Banana Sam Elliott.

38
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:24,863
LeVar "Banana" Burton.

39
00:01:26,032 --> 00:01:27,333
Banana King Tut.

40
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,336
Here, give me that.

41
00:01:29,403 --> 00:01:32,005
It's more like this.

42
00:01:34,243 --> 00:01:35,877
B... banana penis.

43
00:01:37,547 --> 00:01:39,982
Sure, you would've
loved it if he did it.

44
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,184
What?

45
00:01:41,251 --> 00:01:43,119
What's happened to you and me, Troy?

46
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:44,420
Remember how hard we laughed

47
00:01:44,488 --> 00:01:46,022
When we first heard the
term "teacher's aids"?

48
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,257
Yeah.

49
00:01:47,325 --> 00:01:49,326
And then we found out
a teacher did have aids.

50
00:01:49,394 --> 00:01:51,528
So what's everybody doing this summer?

51
00:01:51,596 --> 00:01:53,197
I'm taking the boys on a trip.

52
00:01:53,265 --> 00:01:55,033
Money's tight, so I hope
I can convince them

53
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,836
for one more year that motels
are tiny, little theme parks.

54
00:01:57,903 --> 00:01:59,871
Yeah, I got to find
a new place to live.

55
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:01,273
My dad wants me to leave the nest,

56
00:02:01,341 --> 00:02:02,975
so he feels less weird
that his girlfriend is 20.

57
00:02:03,042 --> 00:02:04,810
You could live in a pyramid.

58
00:02:04,877 --> 00:02:06,478
Oh, wait.

59
00:02:06,546 --> 00:02:08,680
Abed, your dorm room's
got a bunk bed, right?

60
00:02:08,748 --> 00:02:10,882
Yep.

61
00:02:12,985 --> 00:02:15,820
Um, everyone has to go to
the transfer dance tomorrow.

62
00:02:15,887 --> 00:02:16,921
I'm going.

63
00:02:16,988 --> 00:02:18,556
My friend Gary's transferring.

64
00:02:18,623 --> 00:02:19,556
Oh, good.

65
00:02:19,624 --> 00:02:20,691
- Finally.
- Thank God.

66
00:02:20,758 --> 00:02:22,059
Hope he transfers to hell.

67
00:02:22,126 --> 00:02:23,193
More importantly,

68
00:02:23,261 --> 00:02:25,997
our very own Britta Perry,
it turns out,

69
00:02:26,064 --> 00:02:28,766
has been nominated for transfer queen.

70
00:02:28,834 --> 00:02:31,203
Oh, that's nice!

71
00:02:31,271 --> 00:02:33,339
What the hell is a transfer queen?

72
00:02:33,406 --> 00:02:35,007
It's like prom queen.
You wear a sash.

73
00:02:35,075 --> 00:02:36,442
And there's a vote, and if you win,

74
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:38,511
they put a crown on your head,
and I am so jealous, Britta,

75
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:40,113
I want to murder you.
Aren't you excited?

76
00:02:40,181 --> 00:02:41,114
No.

77
00:02:41,181 --> 00:02:42,382
How did I get nominated?

78
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:43,850
Don't let it upset you, Britta.

79
00:02:43,918 --> 00:02:45,351
It's the last day of the semester.

80
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:46,452
Nothing can ruin that.

81
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,520
Hi!

82
00:02:47,588 --> 00:02:49,689
Amazing. He's like an evil genie.

83
00:02:49,756 --> 00:02:51,190
Just spreading the news.

84
00:02:51,258 --> 00:02:52,858
Some folks say "transfer formal"

85
00:02:52,926 --> 00:02:54,526
isn't really rolling off the tongue,

86
00:02:54,594 --> 00:02:58,730
so we're just gonna call
it "The tranny dance"!

87
00:02:58,798 --> 00:03:00,465
Much more Greendale.

90
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:10,809
What kind of community
college has a prom?

91
00:03:10,877 --> 00:03:12,311
Proms weren't even cool in high school.

92
00:03:12,379 --> 00:03:14,513
It's that kind of crap that made
me drop out in the first place.

93
00:03:14,581 --> 00:03:15,748
You know, you don't actually have

94
00:03:15,815 --> 00:03:18,484
to lie on a sofa like
it's a Woody Allen movie.

95
00:03:18,552 --> 00:03:20,820
Thank you for telling me that
in the last session, dumbass.

96
00:03:20,887 --> 00:03:22,321
Now, look...

97
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:24,657
There are bugs on the
windshield of your mind

98
00:03:24,725 --> 00:03:26,558
you may never be able to squeegee,

99
00:03:26,626 --> 00:03:28,428
like a certain birthday party

100
00:03:28,495 --> 00:03:30,663
attended by a rather
enterprising transient

101
00:03:30,731 --> 00:03:32,232
in a dinosaur costume.

102
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,501
But there are other more recent streaks

103
00:03:34,568 --> 00:03:36,503
that you might yet
be able to wipe clear,

104
00:03:36,571 --> 00:03:38,338
like your adolescent fear

105
00:03:38,406 --> 00:03:40,507
of being a so-called blow-up doll.

106
00:03:40,575 --> 00:03:43,176
I really think this nomination
may actually help that.

107
00:03:43,244 --> 00:03:45,011
So you think I'd feel
better about myself

108
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:46,846
if I got all sexed up, went over there,

109
00:03:46,914 --> 00:03:49,617
and really tried to be crowned
queen of the dingbats?

110
00:03:49,684 --> 00:03:51,418
- Precisely.
- Wow.

111
00:03:51,486 --> 00:03:54,021
Guess you really get what
you pay for with free therapy.

112
00:03:54,089 --> 00:03:55,656
Ouch. That stung a little bit.

113
00:03:55,723 --> 00:03:56,657
Thanks.

114
00:03:56,724 --> 00:03:58,325
- Oh.
- Oh.

115
00:03:58,392 --> 00:04:00,627
I'll save you some time.

116
00:04:00,695 --> 00:04:01,962
He listens to you talk for a year,

117
00:04:02,029 --> 00:04:03,296
then recommends a makeover.

118
00:04:03,364 --> 00:04:04,798
Well, don't wear as much lipstick

119
00:04:04,865 --> 00:04:06,132
as you did on Valentine's Day.

120
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,368
Your mouth looked like a coin purse.

121
00:04:08,436 --> 00:04:10,803
Senor Chang...

122
00:04:10,871 --> 00:04:13,639
Greendale's foremost,
if only, Spanish teacher.

123
00:04:13,707 --> 00:04:15,174
What can I do for you?

124
00:04:15,241 --> 00:04:17,609
I am actually a student now.

125
00:04:17,677 --> 00:04:19,477
- Oh.
- But I was thinking,

126
00:04:19,545 --> 00:04:22,147
as a teacher and as my friend,

127
00:04:22,214 --> 00:04:25,316
um, if you could help me...

128
00:04:25,384 --> 00:04:27,285
Cheat my way through school.

129
00:04:27,352 --> 00:04:29,053
I have a counterproposal.

130
00:04:29,121 --> 00:04:30,788
How about...

131
00:04:30,856 --> 00:04:33,658
I point out to you that we've
never actually been friends,

132
00:04:33,726 --> 00:04:36,661
then laugh at your very
well-deserved misfortune?

133
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:39,330
Let's just try that a second.

134
00:04:43,869 --> 00:04:45,670
No, Jorge, you killed it.

135
00:04:45,738 --> 00:04:47,505
Are you going to Abed's kegger?

136
00:04:47,573 --> 00:04:49,174
Sweet.

137
00:04:49,241 --> 00:04:51,176
You probably don't want to talk to me.

138
00:04:51,244 --> 00:04:52,844
Well, it's not junior high.

139
00:04:52,912 --> 00:04:55,514
We're mature adults, Michelle.
We can talk.

140
00:04:55,582 --> 00:04:58,517
I think I handled our breakup poorly.

141
00:04:58,585 --> 00:04:59,852
Before I respond to that,

142
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,121
I'll have to take a
extra-strength vitamin duh.

143
00:05:04,591 --> 00:05:05,790
Duh.

144
00:05:05,858 --> 00:05:07,625
We started getting serious,
and I got scared,

145
00:05:07,693 --> 00:05:10,294
and it's possible I made a mistake.

146
00:05:10,362 --> 00:05:13,130
Maybe we can talk about it sometime.

147
00:05:13,198 --> 00:05:16,166
I miss you.

148
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:17,967
Mm-mmm.

149
00:05:18,035 --> 00:05:21,304
Why don't you take a picture?
It'll last longer.

150
00:05:21,371 --> 00:05:23,406
Cool.

151

152
00:05:35,885 --> 00:05:37,986
- Dope kegger.
- Thanks.

153
00:05:38,054 --> 00:05:39,087
Funny...

154
00:05:39,155 --> 00:05:41,323
You know, I... I spend
so much time here,

155
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,658
I forget that we don't live together.

156
00:05:45,327 --> 00:05:46,661
Then I think...

157
00:05:46,728 --> 00:05:48,696
"What if we lived together?"

158
00:05:48,763 --> 00:05:51,332
Here, I'm gonna check on the other keg.

159
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:53,200
Hey, Troy, you ever seen one of these?

160
00:05:53,268 --> 00:05:54,368
It's called a beer bong.

161
00:05:54,435 --> 00:05:56,336
You're not supposed to inhale, though.

162
00:05:56,404 --> 00:05:57,771
I almost died outside.

163
00:05:57,838 --> 00:05:59,439
Why does abed hate me?

164
00:05:59,506 --> 00:06:00,940
What, are you kidding?
Look at him.

165
00:06:01,008 --> 00:06:02,141
He probably hates America.

166
00:06:02,209 --> 00:06:03,543
Hey, babe, babe.

167
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:04,610
Guess what.

168
00:06:04,678 --> 00:06:06,112
Your boyfriend just got offered a spot

169
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,614
on the number-one
community-college

170
00:06:07,682 --> 00:06:09,049
hacky sack team in the nation.

171
00:06:09,117 --> 00:06:10,818
- Oh, my God! Sweetie!
- Oh, my God.

172
00:06:10,885 --> 00:06:12,086
I'm assuming that's huge.

173
00:06:12,154 --> 00:06:13,388
Of course it's huge.
Are you kidding me?

174
00:06:13,455 --> 00:06:15,457
I mean, you know,
I'm not into the fame and stuff,

175
00:06:15,524 --> 00:06:17,592
but I could be the next
Yngwe Mackadangdang junior.

176
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,161
I know.

177
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:20,630
There's just one thing,
mountain flower,

178
00:06:20,697 --> 00:06:22,798
and that's that the, uh...

179
00:06:22,866 --> 00:06:24,667
the school's in Delaware.

180
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,470
Thank you.

181
00:06:27,538 --> 00:06:28,804
You know...

182
00:06:28,872 --> 00:06:30,305
If you don't go to this dance tomorrow,

183
00:06:30,373 --> 00:06:32,041
we are not gonna see
each other for months.

184
00:06:32,109 --> 00:06:34,843
It's not a Jane Austen novel.
We have cell phones.

185
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:38,113
- What? Aah! Oh.
- Oh, jeez, sorry.

186
00:06:38,181 --> 00:06:39,214
What are you doing?

187
00:06:39,282 --> 00:06:41,450
Well, you had hair I was gonna move.

188
00:06:41,518 --> 00:06:43,319
- You were gonna move my hair?
- I don't know.

189
00:06:43,386 --> 00:06:44,654
Have you ever thought of yourself

190
00:06:44,721 --> 00:06:45,955
as a guarded person, Britta?

191
00:06:46,023 --> 00:06:46,956
Am I?

192
00:06:47,024 --> 00:06:49,492
Watch.

193
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,161
See? It's alarming, right?

194
00:06:51,229 --> 00:06:52,729
Right?

195
00:06:53,732 --> 00:06:55,266
Oh...

196
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,635
Professor Slater, hi.
What are you doing here?

197
00:06:57,703 --> 00:07:00,505
Oh, you know, end of the year,
randomly wandering.

198
00:07:00,573 --> 00:07:01,773
Hi, Jeff.

199
00:07:01,841 --> 00:07:03,142
Are you two...?

200
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:04,310
- No.
- No.

201
00:07:04,377 --> 00:07:05,444
The two of you aren't...?

202
00:07:05,512 --> 00:07:06,679
- No.
- No.

203
00:07:06,746 --> 00:07:08,213
- No, just friends.
- Same here.

204
00:07:08,281 --> 00:07:09,815
Good... for you.

205
00:07:09,882 --> 00:07:12,117
Will I see you at the dance, Britta?

206
00:07:12,185 --> 00:07:13,619
Kind of obligated,

207
00:07:13,686 --> 00:07:15,554
seeing as I'm nominated for queen,

208
00:07:15,621 --> 00:07:16,788
- so...
- Oh.

209
00:07:16,856 --> 00:07:18,656
I thought you were all
into female empowerment.

210
00:07:18,724 --> 00:07:20,791
What's more empowering
than a woman in a crown?

211
00:07:22,961 --> 00:07:25,229
Just did my first keg stand!

212
00:07:25,297 --> 00:07:26,364
Ha ha!

213
00:07:26,432 --> 00:07:28,632
Can't feel my legs.

214
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,700
Mm!

215
00:07:33,006 --> 00:07:37,408
* Dancing in your underwear,
taking air conditioner repair *

216
00:07:38,476 --> 00:07:40,577
* So you can get a job *

217
00:07:40,644 --> 00:07:45,014
* Greendale's the way it goes *

218
00:07:47,352 --> 00:07:48,685
Whoo! Ha ha!

219
00:07:48,753 --> 00:07:52,389
Our original school song by
the venerable Pierce Hawthorne.

220
00:07:52,457 --> 00:07:54,024
He made that up. Hmm?

221
00:07:54,092 --> 00:07:57,194
Everyone remember to vote
before the coronation.

222
00:07:57,262 --> 00:07:59,697
The nominees are identified with sashes

223
00:07:59,765 --> 00:08:01,865
that say "Tranny Queen".

224
00:08:01,933 --> 00:08:04,368
By the way, we do offer summer classes,

225
00:08:04,436 --> 00:08:07,071
which are a great way to, um...

226
00:08:07,138 --> 00:08:09,039
Um, broaden your mind.
Have fun.

227
00:08:10,575 --> 00:08:11,642
Hi. You're here for me.

228
00:08:11,709 --> 00:08:13,010
Guys! Guys...

229
00:08:13,078 --> 00:08:15,879
Vaughn got recruited to
a college in Delaware.

230
00:08:15,947 --> 00:08:17,448
I'm gonna go with him for the summer.

231
00:08:17,516 --> 00:08:19,850
Finally, a classic
last-day-of-school plot twist.

232
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:22,720
He's gonna be the next
Yngwe Mackadangdang junior.

233
00:08:22,788 --> 00:08:24,022
It's a hacky sack guy.

234
00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:25,557
Hey, you don't have to tell us who

235
00:08:25,624 --> 00:08:28,226
Ingmar Mackadingdong junior is.

236
00:08:28,294 --> 00:08:30,729
Jeff, help me with some refreshments.

237
00:08:30,797 --> 00:08:34,033
Please don't tell anyone
until after I'm gone.

238
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:37,403
I'm not just going to
Delaware for the summer.

239
00:08:37,471 --> 00:08:40,171
I'm transferring with Vaughn.

240
00:08:40,239 --> 00:08:41,906
What? When did you decide that?

241
00:08:41,974 --> 00:08:44,909
I spent three months
researching backpacks

242
00:08:44,977 --> 00:08:48,078
before I chose the one that I use now.

243
00:08:48,146 --> 00:08:51,315
I don't want to be that person anymore.

244
00:08:51,383 --> 00:08:53,384
I want to live in the moment.

245
00:08:53,451 --> 00:08:56,020
Well, for your and Vaughn's sake,

246
00:08:56,087 --> 00:08:57,688
I hope it works out.

247
00:08:57,756 --> 00:08:59,857
But on behalf of the rest of the group,

248
00:08:59,925 --> 00:09:01,692
I hope it's a catastrophe.

249
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,730
- You better visit.
- Whoa!

250
00:09:04,797 --> 00:09:07,599
I can't believe nobody's
taken this cookie.

251
00:09:10,103 --> 00:09:12,038
Senor Chang...

252
00:09:12,105 --> 00:09:13,772
Is there a word in Spanish

253
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,241
for someone who used to
pretend to be a professor,

254
00:09:16,309 --> 00:09:18,877
but was a teacher,
but wasn't actually a teacher,

255
00:09:18,945 --> 00:09:20,211
and he's now a student?

256
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:21,946
Is there a word for that?

257
00:09:22,014 --> 00:09:24,382
Oh, if it was in Spanish,
you wouldn't know, would you?

258
00:09:24,449 --> 00:09:25,549
Ah, bup, bup, bup.

259
00:09:25,617 --> 00:09:27,885
Hit a professor, you'll get expelled.

260
00:09:27,952 --> 00:09:31,054
I will find a loophole.

261
00:09:31,122 --> 00:09:32,389
Oh, good luck with that.

262
00:09:32,457 --> 00:09:34,257
Then I'll kill you.

263
00:09:34,325 --> 00:09:35,892
- Good.
- Dudley Moore.

264
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,227
Spray tan.

265
00:09:37,295 --> 00:09:39,129
I'd go easy on that punch if I was you.

266
00:09:39,197 --> 00:09:41,465
I've put in a little... hot person.

267
00:09:41,533 --> 00:09:43,134
Hot people.

268
00:09:43,202 --> 00:09:44,535
There are two of them coming this way.

269
00:09:44,603 --> 00:09:45,536
Which one do you want?

270
00:09:45,604 --> 00:09:47,239
- Hi, Jeff.
- Hi, Jeff.

271
00:09:47,306 --> 00:09:49,108
- Oh.
- Oh.

272
00:09:49,175 --> 00:09:50,909
Britta, you look great.

273
00:09:50,977 --> 00:09:52,444
Such a stunning improvement.

274
00:09:52,512 --> 00:09:53,913
Thank you.
God, you look gorgeous.

275
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,315
It must've taken all day.

276
00:09:56,382 --> 00:09:58,116
Oh.

277
00:09:58,184 --> 00:09:59,518
Oh, Jeff, you've got a...

278
00:09:59,585 --> 00:10:01,653
Oh. It's right there.

279
00:10:01,721 --> 00:10:02,921
- I do? What?
- Actually...

280
00:10:05,158 --> 00:10:06,591
Guys, guys...

281
00:10:06,659 --> 00:10:07,960
Cleanest face ever.

282
00:10:08,027 --> 00:10:09,461
Hey, am I okay?

283
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:11,697
- Yes.
- Yeah.

284
00:10:11,764 --> 00:10:13,931
You know, Troy, uh,
our study group...

285
00:10:13,999 --> 00:10:16,267
After all we've been through,
we got to stick together.

286
00:10:16,335 --> 00:10:19,104
You, me, and Jeff and rain man

287
00:10:19,172 --> 00:10:22,441
and big boobs and medium
boobs and black boobs...

288
00:10:22,508 --> 00:10:23,642
We're a family.

289
00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:24,809
What's your point?

290
00:10:24,877 --> 00:10:26,278
I've been looking at your situation,

291
00:10:26,345 --> 00:10:27,445
and I'd like to make an offer.

292
00:10:27,513 --> 00:10:29,947
Okay.

293
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,482
Am I black boobs?

294
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,585
Last call.

295
00:10:43,197 --> 00:10:44,966
Study over.

296
00:10:48,337 --> 00:10:50,171
What are you doing?

297
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,073
Just giving things a finale vibe.

298
00:10:52,141 --> 00:10:54,175
Well, how's this for a finale vibe?

299
00:10:54,243 --> 00:10:55,877
Pierce asked me to move in with him...

300
00:10:55,945 --> 00:10:57,145
in his mansion.

301
00:10:57,213 --> 00:10:59,280
More of a spin -off vibe,
but you should do it.

302
00:10:59,348 --> 00:11:01,449
- I thought we were friends.
- We are.

303
00:11:01,517 --> 00:11:03,585
Best friends... That's why
we shouldn't be roommates.

304
00:11:03,653 --> 00:11:05,253
We'll end up fighting and
putting a masking-tape line

305
00:11:05,321 --> 00:11:06,387
down the middle of our room.

306
00:11:06,455 --> 00:11:08,623
We just won't get masking tape.

307
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:09,924
Troy, you should live
with someone who you like,

308
00:11:09,992 --> 00:11:11,259
but whose friendship
wouldn't be altered

309
00:11:11,327 --> 00:11:13,261
because of constant
irritation... that's Pierce.

310
00:11:13,329 --> 00:11:14,929
If you and I move in,
we jump the shark.

311
00:11:14,997 --> 00:11:18,766
That'll end it.
Well, maybe you're ending it.

312
00:11:18,834 --> 00:11:20,935
Oh, and for the record,

313
00:11:21,003 --> 00:11:22,604
there was an episode of Happy Days

314
00:11:22,671 --> 00:11:25,773
where a guy literally
jumped over a shark,

315
00:11:25,841 --> 00:11:28,242
and it was the best one.

316
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,114
I think I'm winning.

317
00:11:33,182 --> 00:11:35,683
- Winning... Tranny Queen.
- Yeah.

318
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,451
So, uh, isn't it nice

319
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,154
that Jeff and Slater are
getting back together?

320
00:11:40,222 --> 00:11:42,123
- What?
- Aha! And psych!

321
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,457
But they will get back together

322
00:11:43,525 --> 00:11:45,126
if you don't stop competing with her

323
00:11:45,193 --> 00:11:47,027
and start communicating with Jeff.

324
00:11:47,095 --> 00:11:48,495
She already has a head start.

325
00:11:48,563 --> 00:11:51,532
They slept together.

326
00:11:51,599 --> 00:11:54,568
Holy macaroni with pepper Jack.

327
00:11:54,636 --> 00:11:56,370
When? Where?

328
00:11:56,438 --> 00:11:57,905
During paintball

329
00:11:57,973 --> 00:12:00,174
in the study room with colonel mustard.

330
00:12:00,241 --> 00:12:01,408
Does it matter?

331
00:12:01,476 --> 00:12:02,409
Well, now it does matter.

332
00:12:02,477 --> 00:12:03,744
Where... where in the study room?

333
00:12:03,811 --> 00:12:06,346
On the couches.

334
00:12:06,414 --> 00:12:08,348
- We use those!
- Oh, get over it.

335
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:10,250
I've seen you shake the Dean's hand.

336
00:12:10,318 --> 00:12:12,052
Who knows where he's been?

337
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,055
Do you believe in soul mates?

338
00:12:15,123 --> 00:12:16,489
Oh.

339
00:12:16,557 --> 00:12:18,424
Um, okay, now, don't be mad at me.

340
00:12:18,492 --> 00:12:20,593
I didn't think that more than
one person would answer the ad.

341
00:12:20,661 --> 00:12:21,894
Yes, dream coming true.

342
00:12:21,962 --> 00:12:23,863
You guys are leaving already?

343
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:25,964
Yeah, got to be in Delaware
by tomorrow night.

344
00:12:26,032 --> 00:12:28,133
First practice is Monday morning.

345
00:12:29,635 --> 00:12:33,171
See you soon.

346
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,875
Have a good summer.

347
00:12:36,943 --> 00:12:39,344
I'll see you in the fall, Annie.

348
00:12:45,719 --> 00:12:46,986
We're gonna miss you.

349
00:12:47,054 --> 00:12:48,188
Yeah, you're the one

350
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,456
that didn't even want me
in the study group.

351
00:12:49,523 --> 00:12:50,557
Come on, that's not true.

352
00:12:50,624 --> 00:12:52,726
Yeah, none of us did.

353
00:12:52,793 --> 00:12:54,927
I say things others won't.
That has value.

354
00:12:54,995 --> 00:12:57,130
Well...

355
00:12:57,197 --> 00:12:58,230
Bye.

356
00:12:58,298 --> 00:12:59,565
See ya.

357
00:12:59,633 --> 00:13:00,666
Lates.

358
00:13:05,871 --> 00:13:07,738
Good evening, Michelle.

359
00:13:07,806 --> 00:13:10,274
Or may I say, "meow-chelle"?

360
00:13:10,342 --> 00:13:12,810
- Who has your car keys?
- They're in the taco meat.

361
00:13:12,877 --> 00:13:14,912
Now, what say you and
I blow this pop stand

362
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,248
and head off for a
spot of slap n' tickle?

363
00:13:17,316 --> 00:13:18,583
I mean sex,

364
00:13:18,651 --> 00:13:21,320
in case the lingo hasn't
made it to the States.

365
00:13:21,387 --> 00:13:23,622
I think I'm probably
leaving here with Jeff.

366
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:24,924
Really? I'm sorry, I just...

367
00:13:24,992 --> 00:13:26,259
just assumed that you two were done,

368
00:13:26,326 --> 00:13:27,593
since, uh...

369
00:13:27,661 --> 00:13:31,431
Jeff and Britta did, uh,
the Yankee Doodle.

370
00:13:31,498 --> 00:13:33,266
Oh, don't tell me that
didn't make it to the States.

371
00:13:33,334 --> 00:13:35,268
It clearly originated here.

372
00:13:37,604 --> 00:13:42,041
Okay, we finished
tallying all 36 votes,

373
00:13:42,109 --> 00:13:43,442
so everyone get ready!

374
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:46,345
Yo, Goldilocks.

375
00:13:46,413 --> 00:13:47,346
Drop the smirk.

376
00:13:47,413 --> 00:13:48,680
I know about your grungy tumble,

377
00:13:48,748 --> 00:13:50,282
and I'm sure it was the
highlight of your diary,

378
00:13:50,349 --> 00:13:52,050
but it was during a pit
stop in something real.

379
00:13:52,118 --> 00:13:53,385
You were the pit stop.

380
00:13:53,452 --> 00:13:56,155
He used you to numb the
pain of not getting with me.

381
00:13:56,222 --> 00:13:58,223
Jeff needs a girl who doesn't
just not wear underwear

382
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:00,559
because oprah told her
it would spice things up.

383
00:14:00,626 --> 00:14:02,394
He needs a girl who
doesn't wear underwear

384
00:14:02,462 --> 00:14:04,730
because she hasn't done
laundry in three weeks.

385
00:14:04,798 --> 00:14:07,066
He's been to flavor country now.

386
00:14:07,134 --> 00:14:08,968
They should retire
the table we did it on.

387
00:14:09,036 --> 00:14:10,236
Table?

388
00:14:10,304 --> 00:14:12,706
Miss britta perry!

389
00:14:12,773 --> 00:14:14,741
Oh, I'm sorry. I have to go.

390
00:14:14,809 --> 00:14:17,143
I just won a contest for being hot.

391
00:14:18,311 --> 00:14:21,079
Oh, wow.

392
00:14:21,147 --> 00:14:22,981
This is a huge honor.

393
00:14:23,049 --> 00:14:24,917
This may come as a surprise to you,

394
00:14:24,984 --> 00:14:27,386
but I've never actually
won anything before.

395
00:14:27,453 --> 00:14:28,754
Okay, well, you still haven't.

396
00:14:28,821 --> 00:14:30,088
I'm just listing the nominees,

397
00:14:30,156 --> 00:14:31,823
so not a great time to get cocky.

398
00:14:31,891 --> 00:14:35,359
Okay. Christine Hollinsworth!

399
00:14:37,329 --> 00:14:39,230
Britney Baker!

400
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,501
Mary Jones!

401
00:14:46,671 --> 00:14:48,939
Amy Sm...

402
00:14:49,006 --> 00:14:51,975
Jeff Einger, do not
get back with Slater.

403
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:55,946
I love you.

404
00:15:00,118 --> 00:15:01,885
Psst, psst, Britta.

405
00:15:01,953 --> 00:15:03,086
Britta!

406
00:15:03,154 --> 00:15:04,688
Your lipstick looks better.

407
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:17,070
Hey, man.

408
00:15:17,137 --> 00:15:18,904
How's it going?

409
00:15:18,972 --> 00:15:20,572
Uh, don't shoot the messenger,

410
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,074
but everyone at this dance

411
00:15:22,141 --> 00:15:25,477
is kind of waiting for
your reaction to all this.

412
00:15:25,545 --> 00:15:26,912
Look, I'm trying to think, okay?

413
00:15:26,979 --> 00:15:28,880
Yeah, that's cool.
Take your time.

414
00:15:28,948 --> 00:15:30,916
Hey, how's it going?
You look great.

415
00:15:30,983 --> 00:15:32,784
Very fatal attraction.

416
00:15:32,852 --> 00:15:35,286
Ah.

417
00:15:35,354 --> 00:15:37,755
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm sick.

418
00:15:37,823 --> 00:15:39,924
I don't know why.

419
00:15:39,991 --> 00:15:41,158
Have you considered

420
00:15:41,226 --> 00:15:42,460
the 60-inch-diameter
cookie you're eating?

421
00:15:42,527 --> 00:15:44,362
How can something that's delicious

422
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:45,930
make me sick?

423
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,367
Unless too much of a good thing...

424
00:15:50,435 --> 00:15:53,371
is actually a bad thing.

425
00:15:53,439 --> 00:15:55,640
My friendship with Abed
is a giant cookie.

426
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,242
Look, I kind of got my own
thing going on right now.

427
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:59,078
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

428
00:16:10,858 --> 00:16:13,393
First of all...

429
00:16:13,461 --> 00:16:14,728
I'm flattered.

430
00:16:14,795 --> 00:16:16,563
Second...

431
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,431
Have you ever heard of...

432
00:16:18,499 --> 00:16:20,600
email?

433
00:16:20,668 --> 00:16:22,769
You love me?

434
00:16:24,638 --> 00:16:25,805
Do you love me?

435
00:16:25,872 --> 00:16:28,774
I have something to say.

436
00:16:28,842 --> 00:16:31,743
Jeff...

437
00:16:31,811 --> 00:16:32,945
I love you.

438
00:16:33,013 --> 00:16:35,047
I wonder where she got that from.

439
00:16:35,115 --> 00:16:37,683
I'm sorry. Do you have a
patent on loving people?

440
00:16:37,751 --> 00:16:39,651
Would you like a patent
in getting your ass kicked?

441
00:16:39,719 --> 00:16:41,620
Okay, okay.

442
00:16:41,688 --> 00:16:43,789
Can you stand over there?

443
00:16:45,391 --> 00:16:47,559
And can you sit down...

444
00:16:47,626 --> 00:16:48,960
please?

445
00:16:56,101 --> 00:16:57,602
Jeffrey...

446
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,836
Choose Britta.

447
00:16:58,904 --> 00:16:59,904
- Yeah, Team Britta.
- Yeah, that's right.

448
00:16:59,972 --> 00:17:01,139
Britta's lame.

449
00:17:01,206 --> 00:17:02,473
Team Slater.

450
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:03,675
- Team Slater.
- Choose Britta.

451
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,010
Bring Conan back!

452
00:17:06,946 --> 00:17:08,547
Shh.

453
00:17:08,614 --> 00:17:10,516
Ye... It's been a... a great year.

454
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:13,251
Can't hear you.
No one can hear you.

455
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:20,326
Uh, hi, it's, um...

456
00:17:20,393 --> 00:17:22,161
Oh, come on, who are you choosing?

457
00:17:32,972 --> 00:17:34,173
I... I don't know.

458
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,008
Oh.

459
00:17:39,813 --> 00:17:42,348
Everybody sh...
Everybody close their faces.

460
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:43,850
All right, he's got a lot on his mind.

461
00:17:43,917 --> 00:17:45,017
Leave him alone.

462
00:17:45,085 --> 00:17:46,519
Oka... I got it from here.

463
00:17:46,586 --> 00:17:49,856
My name is Professor Ian Duncan,

464
00:17:49,923 --> 00:17:52,860
and I would like to rap for you.

465
00:17:52,927 --> 00:17:54,194
Drop a beat.

466
00:17:54,262 --> 00:17:56,697
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

467
00:17:56,765 --> 00:17:59,167
* My name is Ian Duncan,
and I'm here to say*

468
00:17:59,234 --> 00:18:01,536
* I'm going to rap to the beat
in a rapping way *

469
00:18:01,604 --> 00:18:04,038
* I've got a real big penis,
and I drink lots of tea *

470
00:18:04,106 --> 00:18:05,272
Oh, okay. Okay, okay.

471
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,474
No, no, no, you know what, Duncan?

472
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:07,475
- What?
- That's enough.

473
00:18:07,542 --> 00:18:08,475
- Why?
- You have a problem.

474
00:18:08,543 --> 00:18:09,710
- Oh, I have a problem?
- Yes.

475
00:18:09,778 --> 00:18:12,146
Who is it here who
has a dalmatian fetish?

476
00:18:12,213 --> 00:18:13,380
Oh, ok... okay.

477
00:18:13,448 --> 00:18:15,549
Well, that is a oversimplification,

478
00:18:15,617 --> 00:18:16,917
and you are suspended.

479
00:18:16,985 --> 00:18:18,451
Oh, come on.

480
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:19,886
Oh, not a teacher anymore.

481
00:18:19,953 --> 00:18:21,387
What's this?

482
00:18:21,455 --> 00:18:22,755
A roll of quarters. Why?

483
00:18:22,823 --> 00:18:24,056
Funny question. Oh, man!

484
00:18:24,124 --> 00:18:25,558
- Friends, help me, friends!
- Help me!

485
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:27,427
He's on me! He's on me!

486
00:18:27,495 --> 00:18:29,562
I'll do it. I'll move in with you.

487
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,231
Fantastic, buddy!

488
00:18:31,298 --> 00:18:32,565
Why don't you come over on Saturday?

489
00:18:32,633 --> 00:18:34,134
My tailor will fit you for a uniform.

490
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:39,772
Guys, let's break it up.
Come on, let's not fight.

491
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,973
Let's not fight.

492
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:42,709
No, no!

493
00:19:03,932 --> 00:19:05,099
I thought you left.

494
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:07,702
I couldn't go.

495
00:19:07,769 --> 00:19:08,736
What happened?

496
00:19:08,804 --> 00:19:10,371
I guess as we were driving away,

497
00:19:10,439 --> 00:19:12,874
I finally started living in the moment,

498
00:19:12,941 --> 00:19:15,709
and I realized that, in the moment,

499
00:19:15,777 --> 00:19:17,178
greendale is where I belong.

500
00:19:18,747 --> 00:19:20,315
What are you doing out here?

501
00:19:20,383 --> 00:19:22,217
Oh, you know...

502
00:19:22,285 --> 00:19:24,153
Britta and Slater told me
they loved me.

503
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,054
- Really?
- Yeah.

504
00:19:26,122 --> 00:19:28,057
- What did you do?
- I ran away.

505
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,059
I don't know. It's hard.

506
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,894
Slater makes me feel like I do

507
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:34,064
when I write my new year's resolutions.

508
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:36,300
She makes me feel like
the guy I want to be.

509
00:19:36,368 --> 00:19:38,402
And britta makes me
feel like the guy I am

510
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,238
three weeks after new year's,

511
00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:41,739
when I'm back to
hitting my snooze button

512
00:19:41,807 --> 00:19:43,341
and screening my
mom's phone calls...

513
00:19:43,408 --> 00:19:44,875
back to who I really am.

514
00:19:44,943 --> 00:19:46,577
So...

515
00:19:46,645 --> 00:19:48,746
Do you try to evolve...

516
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:51,749
or do you try to know what you are?

517
00:19:51,817 --> 00:19:53,084
I don't know.

518
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:54,919
I wish I could live two lives.

519
00:19:54,987 --> 00:19:57,688
One of me would go with Vaughn,
and one of me could stay here.

520
00:19:57,756 --> 00:19:59,090
Yeah, one of me could
be back with Slater,

521
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:00,591
and the other could try it with Britta.

522
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:02,092
And then we could all get together

523
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,526
for some weird foursome.

524
00:20:04,962 --> 00:20:07,763
Um, I guess I got to...

525
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:08,898
got to deal with it.

526
00:20:08,965 --> 00:20:10,266
Good luck.

527
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:13,101
Um...

528
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:14,369
I'm glad you're staying.

529
00:20:30,122 --> 00:20:40,191

530
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,120
Oh, my God.

531
00:20:43,187 --> 00:20:45,289
I'm finally popular enough
to be in the yearbook.

532
00:20:45,356 --> 00:20:46,957
What do you mean "video yearbook"?

533
00:20:47,024 --> 00:20:48,459
Where do I sign?

534
00:20:48,527 --> 00:20:50,461
Photo not available.

535
00:20:50,528 --> 00:20:52,597
This better not be one of those
take-your-top-off videos.

536
00:20:52,665 --> 00:20:54,266
I don't believe in yearbooks.

537
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:55,934
I just want people to remember

538
00:20:56,002 --> 00:20:57,803
there's a guy in between these things.

539
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,137
What a year.

540
00:20:59,205 --> 00:21:00,505
Only two pregnancy scares.

541
00:21:00,573 --> 00:21:04,408
I give this year a "D"
for "delightful".

542
00:21:04,476 --> 00:21:07,946
I can't believe
I spent ten bucks on this.

543
00:21:08,014 --> 00:21:09,914
I don't know any of these people.

544
