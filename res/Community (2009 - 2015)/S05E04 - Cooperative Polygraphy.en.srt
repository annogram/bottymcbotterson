1
00:00:02,104 --> 00:00:04,156
Well, that was a weird afternoon.

2
00:00:04,315 --> 00:00:08,277
I guess I knew Pierce
was part of a weird, futuristic cult...

3
00:00:08,444 --> 00:00:11,790
...but I wasn't prepared for a funeral
with so much beeping.

4
00:00:11,947 --> 00:00:13,158
Well, let's not judge.

5
00:00:13,324 --> 00:00:14,415
Everyone has a right...

6
00:00:14,575 --> 00:00:17,624
...to whatever fake religion
they delusionally choose.

7
00:00:17,786 --> 00:00:21,168
Abed, you were by the coffin
for a long time. Are you okay?

8
00:00:21,332 --> 00:00:23,419
I'm okay. Although...

9
00:00:24,335 --> 00:00:26,340
Troy and Abed are in mourning

10
00:00:26,504 --> 00:00:27,595
Please stop doing that.

11
00:00:27,755 --> 00:00:31,682
I can't believe you did it
during your eulogy. So uncomfortable.

12
00:00:31,842 --> 00:00:34,560
I don't think they got we were singing
"mourning" with a U.

13
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,018
You were singing "mourning" with a U?
Oh, no.

14
00:00:38,182 --> 00:00:40,982
I still don't fully understand
the laser lotus theology.

15
00:00:41,143 --> 00:00:44,192
So Pierce's body is in the coffin,
and we buried it...

16
00:00:44,355 --> 00:00:47,701
...but this energon pod
contains his life vapour?

17
00:00:47,858 --> 00:00:51,204
All right here in this incredibly
persuasive literature they passed out.

18
00:00:51,362 --> 00:00:54,708
Once you reach level 16,
you can see the colour blurble.

19
00:00:54,865 --> 00:00:57,285
Ridiculous cartoon nonsense.
If there is a blurble...

20
00:00:57,451 --> 00:01:00,334
- ...the Lord keeps it hidden for a reason.
- What up, N-bombs?

21
00:01:00,496 --> 00:01:02,501
How was the funeral? Awesome?

22
00:01:02,665 --> 00:01:05,512
No, Chang, our friend's funeral
was not awesome.

23
00:01:05,668 --> 00:01:08,218
It was deeply sad.
You know, funeral style.

24
00:01:08,379 --> 00:01:10,882
Excuse me.
I thought you guys hated Pierce.

25
00:01:11,048 --> 00:01:12,341
- No.
- We didn't hate Pierce.

26
00:01:12,508 --> 00:01:13,552
Craziness.

27
00:01:13,717 --> 00:01:17,561
Are you sure you guys aren't just doing
the "respect the dead" jig-a-lig?

28
00:01:17,721 --> 00:01:19,892
I think you have us mistaken
for you, Chang.

29
00:01:20,057 --> 00:01:24,696
I don't know. I definitely remember
you complaining about him a lot.

30
00:01:24,854 --> 00:01:27,571
Complained about him
when he was alive. This is different.

31
00:01:27,731 --> 00:01:31,742
- Can't believe we'll never see him again.
- Reminder, gotta live life to the fullest.

32
00:01:31,902 --> 00:01:35,331
By the time Pierce was my age,
he had already been fired from 15 jobs.

33
00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:37,993
I've only seen two Police Academys.

34
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,879
The last two.

35
00:01:40,035 --> 00:01:42,456
Well, he's gone too soon
but won't be soon forgotten.

36
00:01:42,621 --> 00:01:45,006
I would say you're quite correct,
Mr. Winger.

37
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:47,384
- Who the hell are you?
- My name is Mr. Stone.

38
00:01:47,543 --> 00:01:49,595
That's easy for you to say.

39
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:51,517
And for us to say.

40
00:01:51,672 --> 00:01:52,965
I work for Mr. Hawthorne.

41
00:01:53,132 --> 00:01:56,311
He specified in his will that no matter
how natural in appearance...

42
00:01:56,468 --> 00:01:58,141
...the circumstances of his death...

43
00:01:58,304 --> 00:02:02,065
...a private inquest should be conducted
to determine whether any one of you...

44
00:02:02,224 --> 00:02:03,731
...his former study group...

45
00:02:04,059 --> 00:02:05,103
...murdered him.

46
00:02:05,478 --> 00:02:06,569
- What?
- To be cleared...

47
00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:09,315
...you must all submit
to a polygraph test.

48
00:02:09,482 --> 00:02:12,910
Schnizzle, you guys are in trouble.

49
00:02:13,402 --> 00:02:15,739
- Later.
- Mr. Chang, I presume.

50
00:02:15,905 --> 00:02:18,788
You're also listed as a suspect
and requested to participate.

51
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:20,954
Fine, but I ask the questions.

52
00:02:21,118 --> 00:02:25,211
- I'm afraid I can't allow that.
- All right, then just the "fine" part.

53
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:28,460
We're losing Pierce.

54
00:02:28,626 --> 00:02:30,547
Everyone, quickly.

55
00:02:34,924 --> 00:02:37,095
Someone get a balloon.

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,074
https://www.1800911911.com
WWW.1800911911.com WWW.1800911911.com

57
00:03:03,744 --> 00:03:07,090
I always wanted to try a polygraph.
Like the pie fight of cop movies.

58
00:03:07,248 --> 00:03:09,004
Or the acupuncture
of the legal system.

59
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:11,467
Can't believe Pierce'd think
we might murder him.

60
00:03:11,627 --> 00:03:14,510
Yeah, what a waste of murder.
I mean, he was, like, 79.

61
00:03:14,672 --> 00:03:17,637
Don't suppose anyone wants to know
I consider this a violation.

62
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,639
Come on, it's just Pierce being Pierce.

63
00:03:19,802 --> 00:03:21,522
- Final wish.
- If I had a final wish...

64
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:24,443
- ...I'd use it to stay alive.
- Do it. How do we begin?

65
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:26,354
We're gonna start with Ms. Perry.

66
00:03:26,517 --> 00:03:28,107
- State your name.
- Britta Perry.

67
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:30,523
Had any thoughts of violence
towards Pierce?

68
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,862
- No.
- Lie.

69
00:03:32,189 --> 00:03:35,867
I mean, we all wanted to slap him
now and again, but I didn't kill him.

70
00:03:36,026 --> 00:03:38,032
In all your sexual fantasies
about Pierce...

71
00:03:38,195 --> 00:03:40,366
- ...none of them involved his murder?
- What? No.

72
00:03:40,531 --> 00:03:42,702
You had sexual fantasies
about Mr. Hawthorne.

73
00:03:42,867 --> 00:03:45,797
- No! What kind of question is that?
- I'm asking the questions...

74
00:03:45,953 --> 00:03:48,717
...just as Mr. Hawthorne
wrote them down, I assure you.

75
00:03:48,873 --> 00:03:51,506
- Mr. Winger, state your name.
- Jeffrey Winger.

76
00:03:51,667 --> 00:03:52,711
- Are you gay?
- No.

77
00:03:52,877 --> 00:03:54,348
- You sure you're not gay?
- Yes.

78
00:03:54,503 --> 00:03:55,891
- Gay murderer says what?
- What?

79
00:03:56,046 --> 00:03:59,012
- He's telling the truth.
- I'll point out that means you're gay.

80
00:03:59,175 --> 00:04:01,725
- Ms. Bennett. State your name.
- Shirley Bennett.

81
00:04:01,886 --> 00:04:03,227
Are you a dishonest person?

82
00:04:03,387 --> 00:04:04,894
- No.
- She thinks that's true.

83
00:04:05,055 --> 00:04:08,152
You could have just said no.
I'm watching you acting scientific...

84
00:04:08,309 --> 00:04:11,737
...and then adding your little two cents
every now and again. Continue.

85
00:04:11,896 --> 00:04:16,487
Is it true you're a donor with the pro-life
organisation prenatalpatriots.org?

86
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,204
- What?
- Keep it cool, girls.

87
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,662
It's my money. It's my choice.

88
00:04:20,821 --> 00:04:24,831
If I wanted the government in my uterus,
I'd fill it with oil and Hispanic voters.

89
00:04:24,992 --> 00:04:27,127
Keep it frosty.
Don't let your goats get got.

90
00:04:27,286 --> 00:04:29,421
Mr. Barnes, state your name.

91
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,003
Troy Barnes.

92
00:04:31,165 --> 00:04:32,506
I meant to say Butts Carlton.

93
00:04:32,917 --> 00:04:34,423
He did mean to say Butts Carlton.

94
00:04:35,503 --> 00:04:37,923
Barnes, you get angry
when Mr. Hawthorne told you...

95
00:04:38,088 --> 00:04:39,595
...Fat Albert died of diabetes?

96
00:04:39,757 --> 00:04:41,560
Yes, like any American would.

97
00:04:41,717 --> 00:04:43,224
- Angry enough to murder him?
- No.

98
00:04:43,385 --> 00:04:46,648
Is it true you and Abed Nadir have
an elaborate doomsday escape plan...

99
00:04:46,805 --> 00:04:49,771
...to be used in the event
of zombie attacks?

100
00:04:49,934 --> 00:04:52,235
We may have
a designated rendezvous point...

101
00:04:52,394 --> 00:04:56,025
...and a couple of bug-out bags
filled with gold coins and condoms...

102
00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:00,413
...in case we need to bargain our way
onto a boat. Gold coins for buying food.

103
00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:04,413
Does your doomsday plan account for
the welfare of any of your other friends?

104
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,080
- Pass.
- Answer the question.

105
00:05:07,368 --> 00:05:09,254
- No.
- Troy. Rude.

106
00:05:09,411 --> 00:05:11,499
It's a doomsday plan, not a picnic plan.

107
00:05:11,664 --> 00:05:15,211
You wanna see the horrors we might
have to endure just to get on a boat?

108
00:05:15,376 --> 00:05:16,633
- Guess not.
- That's a lie.

109
00:05:17,086 --> 00:05:18,343
He's doing it again.

110
00:05:18,504 --> 00:05:19,975
Pierce is doing it again.

111
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,803
Mr. Chang, state your name.

112
00:05:21,966 --> 00:05:25,312
Benjamin Franklin Chang,
ready to deal out the truth.

113
00:05:25,469 --> 00:05:28,269
Nothing to hide. Let's do this.

114
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,981
Have you ever masturbated
in the study room?

115
00:05:33,894 --> 00:05:36,575
- Mr. Nadir, state your name.
- Abed Nadir.

116
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,866
- Have you ever 9/11 'd anyone?
- No.

117
00:05:39,024 --> 00:05:43,200
When you were a child, did you kill a
squirrel, surprised you felt nothing...

118
00:05:43,362 --> 00:05:46,328
...and wonder if you were capable
of doing it to a human?

119
00:05:48,492 --> 00:05:50,046
No.

120
00:05:51,912 --> 00:05:54,332
Do you and Troy still use
Jeff's Netflix account...

121
00:05:54,498 --> 00:05:57,179
- ...without his permission?
- You told Pierce that?

122
00:05:57,334 --> 00:05:59,422
You logged in at our place,
never logged out.

123
00:05:59,587 --> 00:06:02,173
Is that why my review of The Grey
is changing?

124
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:04,594
- Stop giving it four stars.
- I like Liam Neeson.

125
00:06:04,758 --> 00:06:06,230
Send him a message about roles.

126
00:06:06,385 --> 00:06:08,521
This is not the issue.
You're stealing from me.

127
00:06:08,679 --> 00:06:11,265
And as your roommate,
you're making me an accomplice.

128
00:06:11,432 --> 00:06:12,689
- I had no idea.
- Lie.

129
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,487
Why would I even try that?

130
00:06:14,643 --> 00:06:17,692
- State your name please, miss.
- Annie Edison.

131
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:20,536
Did you use your intelligence
and organizational skills...

132
00:06:20,691 --> 00:06:23,704
...to plot the foolproof murder
of Pierce Hawthorne?

133
00:06:23,861 --> 00:06:25,202
And no.

134
00:06:25,362 --> 00:06:28,791
Is it true you overcharged Troy and
Abed for their share of the rent?

135
00:06:29,408 --> 00:06:31,627
- Pierce.
- Annie?

136
00:06:31,785 --> 00:06:33,791
Yes, but for a good reason.

137
00:06:33,954 --> 00:06:35,757
You guys know
you're bad with money.

138
00:06:35,915 --> 00:06:37,836
I padded your share of the rent
by $10.

139
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,049
I've been putting it into a savings
account that yields 4 percent.

140
00:06:41,212 --> 00:06:44,889
You'll be thanking me in six years
when you find out you have $86.

141
00:06:45,049 --> 00:06:46,223
That's jacket money.

142
00:06:46,383 --> 00:06:49,064
Did you hear that, Abed?
We've been washing paper plates...

143
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,355
...and making our own toothpaste.
Don't worry.

144
00:06:51,514 --> 00:06:54,064
When we have robot bodies,
we can share a free jacket.

145
00:06:54,225 --> 00:06:57,404
You should know better than to hoard
money. That's a stereotype.

146
00:06:57,561 --> 00:06:59,898
- Was that anti-Semitism?
- No.

147
00:07:00,064 --> 00:07:01,108
That's sensitivity.

148
00:07:01,273 --> 00:07:04,655
It's anti-Semitic to do things like that
when you know you're Jewish.

149
00:07:05,569 --> 00:07:07,906
We could have bought a tyre
for our tyre swing.

150
00:07:08,072 --> 00:07:09,365
Or your own Netflix account?

151
00:07:09,532 --> 00:07:11,038
Liam Neeson? Not that great.

152
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,585
As if you were ever gonna get that tyre.

153
00:07:15,246 --> 00:07:16,918
All right.

154
00:07:18,415 --> 00:07:19,673
Let's begin.

155
00:07:19,834 --> 00:07:22,598
Wait, wait.
What do you mean, "begin"?

156
00:07:22,753 --> 00:07:26,265
That completes calibration questioning.
We're ready to begin the inquest.

157
00:07:26,423 --> 00:07:28,927
We're ready to end.
We've humoured this long enough.

158
00:07:29,093 --> 00:07:31,180
Jeff, it's for Pierce.

159
00:07:31,345 --> 00:07:33,849
Look, respect for the dead
is only a thing...

160
00:07:34,014 --> 00:07:36,565
...because the dead usually
don't do any more damage.

161
00:07:36,934 --> 00:07:39,520
- That's true.
- You can quit any time you like.

162
00:07:39,687 --> 00:07:43,199
It should be noted Mr. Hawthorne's
estate is worth over $20 million.

163
00:07:43,357 --> 00:07:46,620
Only those cleared of his murder
can receive their bequeathments.

164
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:50,451
I'm only gonna say this once.
Clearly, Pierce is trying to lure us...

165
00:07:50,614 --> 00:07:54,327
...into a labyrinth of emotional
manipulation and strategic instigation.

166
00:07:54,493 --> 00:07:57,875
We're all smart enough to know
we should quit while we're not ahead.

167
00:07:58,038 --> 00:08:00,090
- I do believe we should.
- Yes, definitely.

168
00:08:00,249 --> 00:08:01,803
- Absolutely.
- Right.

169
00:08:02,334 --> 00:08:06,095
- They're all lying.
- We all know that, you judgmental bitch.

170
00:08:09,133 --> 00:08:11,103
PIERCE ANASTASIA HAWTHORNE

171
00:08:12,303 --> 00:08:14,771
Ms. Perry, have you ever eaten
at the sandwich shop...

172
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:17,066
...started by Mrs. Bennett
and Mr. Hawthorne?

173
00:08:17,224 --> 00:08:19,942
- Yes.
- And what sandwich would you order?

174
00:08:20,102 --> 00:08:22,321
Only one I can,
the Helen of Soy with no mayo.

175
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,410
- Helen of Soy.
- Are you aware that to save money...

176
00:08:25,566 --> 00:08:29,078
...Shirley stopped using real tofu and
replaced it with Midwestern tofu...

177
00:08:29,236 --> 00:08:31,076
...called meatfu?

178
00:08:31,238 --> 00:08:32,828
Oh, my God!

179
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,790
It's still not actually meat, legally.

180
00:08:35,951 --> 00:08:39,249
You have never respected anything
that I hold sacred.

181
00:08:39,413 --> 00:08:41,252
- I'm sorry.
- Did you know that Britta...

182
00:08:41,415 --> 00:08:44,345
...was high on marijuana
at your son's baptism?

183
00:08:44,752 --> 00:08:45,796
I'm sorry?

184
00:08:45,961 --> 00:08:48,595
- Well, no higher than usual.
- Not true.

185
00:08:48,756 --> 00:08:50,761
You did drugs in my church?

186
00:08:50,925 --> 00:08:53,096
I did drugs in the parking lot
of your church.

187
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,143
How do you expect somebody
to sit through something like that?

188
00:08:56,305 --> 00:08:58,476
With a bris,
there's an element of suspense.

189
00:08:58,641 --> 00:09:00,977
Next time, I'll have Cheech and Chong
do warm-up.

190
00:09:01,143 --> 00:09:03,528
Guys, these questions
are obviously designed...

191
00:09:03,687 --> 00:09:06,701
...to turn us against each other.
If we wanna beat Pierce...

192
00:09:06,857 --> 00:09:09,361
...we own up to our mistakes
and forgive each other.

193
00:09:09,527 --> 00:09:13,038
Mr. Winger, is it true that you keep
trophies of your sexual conquests?

194
00:09:13,197 --> 00:09:15,036
In a church, Britta?

195
00:09:15,199 --> 00:09:16,456
For shame.

196
00:09:16,617 --> 00:09:18,124
It's where Jesus gets his mail.

197
00:09:18,285 --> 00:09:20,373
Answer the question, Adrien Grody.

198
00:09:20,746 --> 00:09:22,668
I know what Pierce is referring to.

199
00:09:22,832 --> 00:09:26,046
I have a box of forgotten items
in my apartment.

200
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:27,551
I happen to be a single male.

201
00:09:27,711 --> 00:09:28,969
Visitors leave things.

202
00:09:29,129 --> 00:09:31,680
Is one of your trophies
a pair of Ms. Perry's panties?

203
00:09:32,716 --> 00:09:34,722
You told me a hawk stole them.

204
00:09:34,885 --> 00:09:36,226
You exploited me...

205
00:09:36,387 --> 00:09:39,685
...and made me believe
in a slightly more magical world.

206
00:09:39,849 --> 00:09:41,486
To collect women's underwear,
can't you buy them?

207
00:09:41,642 --> 00:09:43,279
They have to be won in battle.

208
00:09:43,561 --> 00:09:45,151
- Gross.
- Awesome.

209
00:09:45,312 --> 00:09:49,738
I think we can all agree the gross thing
is Pierce snooping through my stuff.

210
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,036
Abed and I go through
your stuff all the time.

211
00:09:52,194 --> 00:09:53,582
Why keep bread in the freezer?

212
00:09:53,737 --> 00:09:55,992
Why's your bathroom mirror
say "you're special"?

213
00:09:56,157 --> 00:09:59,004
- I don't have to ans... You took a shower?
- Yeah.

214
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,840
- Mr. Barnes.
- Okay. I did it, okay? I killed Pierce.

215
00:10:01,996 --> 00:10:03,549
- Lie.
- Okay, good.

216
00:10:03,706 --> 00:10:04,749
Just making sure.

217
00:10:04,915 --> 00:10:08,261
You and Abed have a specialised,
exclusive handshake you refuse to do...

218
00:10:08,419 --> 00:10:11,218
- ...with your other friends?
- Absolutely.

219
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,385
Mr. Barnes,
did you invent that handshake?

220
00:10:13,549 --> 00:10:15,269
- Yes.
- Lie.

221
00:10:15,634 --> 00:10:19,063
Mr. Barnes, are you a subscriber
to the video blog Fun For Friends?

222
00:10:19,221 --> 00:10:20,432
- No.
- Lie.

223
00:10:20,598 --> 00:10:21,939
Silence, wench!

224
00:10:23,184 --> 00:10:24,394
Hi, I'm Kevin.

225
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,617
This is Kyle, and here's a fun handshake
you can do with your best friend.

226
00:10:29,273 --> 00:10:31,112
All right. Thanks for watching, guys.

227
00:10:31,275 --> 00:10:34,075
Don't forget to rate us,
comment, and subscribe.

228
00:10:34,236 --> 00:10:36,621
- I can't look at you.
- You should know I'm crying.

229
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,995
I forgive you. To escape the pattern
of self-righteous indignation...

230
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:42,709
- ...followed by immediate comeuppance.
- Mr. Nadir.

231
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,089
It's happening. You broke my heart.
Continue.

232
00:10:45,247 --> 00:10:48,510
Is it true you planted trafficking devices
on everyone so you'd know...

233
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:50,423
- ...where they are at all times?
- Yes.

234
00:10:53,255 --> 00:10:55,474
You're changing your faces.
Mad at me or hungry?

235
00:10:55,633 --> 00:10:56,974
You're tracking us?

236
00:10:57,134 --> 00:10:59,898
- We're mad at you, Abed.
- Why?

237
00:11:00,054 --> 00:11:02,984
Because we already live
in a totalitarian surveillance state.

238
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:06,355
- Do you not read my updates?
- I'm not the government. I'm your friend.

239
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:08,191
That's what governments say, nimrod.

240
00:11:08,354 --> 00:11:12,067
When one of you gets kidnapped
you'll be glad you don't have to count...

241
00:11:12,233 --> 00:11:16,113
- ...the bumps from the trunk of a car.
- Are those blinking dots us?

242
00:11:16,278 --> 00:11:19,826
- What's this one all the way to the side?
- That's where Pierce is buried.

243
00:11:20,908 --> 00:11:24,254
Is that why you were spending
so much time by the coffin?

244
00:11:24,537 --> 00:11:26,755
I was trying to get it back.
They're expensive.

245
00:11:26,914 --> 00:11:28,836
Abed,
where did you plant these things?

246
00:11:28,999 --> 00:11:30,672
Feel better, you'll never find them.

247
00:11:30,835 --> 00:11:35,176
I know you know it's wrong to do that
without telling us. Shame on you.

248
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:37,593
- Okay, I'm ashamed. Lie.
- Lie.

249
00:11:37,758 --> 00:11:40,855
Ms. Edison, is it true you once dosed
the members of your group...

250
00:11:41,011 --> 00:11:43,396
...with a pharmaceutical
amphetamine?

251
00:11:48,018 --> 00:11:49,691
- Yes, kind of.
- What?

252
00:11:49,854 --> 00:11:52,322
It sounds worse on paper than it was.

253
00:11:52,481 --> 00:11:56,112
We were cramming for the anthro final.
Everyone was falling asleep.

254
00:11:56,277 --> 00:12:00,203
I put 5 milligrams of something in your
coffees and we all got an A. Done.

255
00:12:00,364 --> 00:12:03,995
I'm a bad person for tracking you,
but you altered brain chemistry?

256
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,251
I was up for three days.

257
00:12:05,411 --> 00:12:07,831
I invented a language,
you fiiztbarping gitzgorg.

258
00:12:07,997 --> 00:12:10,168
- Sorry.
- You messed with my brain. A big deal.

259
00:12:10,332 --> 00:12:12,219
I don't mess with your brain, Annie.

260
00:12:12,376 --> 00:12:14,049
- You kind of do.
- I don't think I do.

261
00:12:14,211 --> 00:12:16,631
- What about her Facebook boyfriend?
- It's different.

262
00:12:16,797 --> 00:12:20,012
You made a profile for a fake dude
and lured her into a relationship.

263
00:12:20,176 --> 00:12:21,219
He's catfishing you.

264
00:12:22,136 --> 00:12:25,398
You're Olympic pole-vaulting hopeful
Brent Underjaw?

265
00:12:25,556 --> 00:12:28,902
Whenever you were in a relationship,
you hummed a lot and made pancakes.

266
00:12:29,059 --> 00:12:31,195
I did what I did
in the name of breakfast.

267
00:12:31,353 --> 00:12:33,821
I bore my soul to you.

268
00:12:33,981 --> 00:12:37,078
I told you about my
holding hands at Disneyland fantasy.

269
00:12:37,568 --> 00:12:40,249
Do you care about people at all, Abed?

270
00:12:40,404 --> 00:12:42,990
Answer on the polygraph.

271
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,503
Jeff made me apply for handicapped
parking so he can get a better spot.

272
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:49,164
Britta invited Garrett
to Annie's birthday party.

273
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,335
Troy won't sit on the toilet seat
after Jeff.

274
00:12:51,499 --> 00:12:54,002
When alone, Shirley refers
to you as "those people."

275
00:12:54,168 --> 00:12:56,932
When Annie's with other females,
she calls Jeff her uncle.

276
00:12:57,087 --> 00:13:00,682
- Shirley thinks we're all going to hell.
- You are all going to hell.

277
00:13:00,841 --> 00:13:04,270
We're not necessarily gonna go to hell.
I mean, what is hell?

278
00:13:04,428 --> 00:13:08,272
Guys, stop! We have to stop
letting Pierce do this to us.

279
00:13:08,641 --> 00:13:11,855
Mr. Hawthorne hasn't asked a question
in quite some time, Mr. Winger.

280
00:13:13,312 --> 00:13:14,819
He's right.

281
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,780
I actually forgot for a second
that Pierce was dead.

282
00:13:17,942 --> 00:13:19,781
Maybe that's what he wanted.

283
00:13:19,944 --> 00:13:22,494
Or he wanted us to know
we're no better off without him.

284
00:13:22,655 --> 00:13:24,245
Or no better than him.

285
00:13:26,325 --> 00:13:27,796
He kind of nailed it, didn't he?

286
00:13:28,577 --> 00:13:31,211
I didn't just masturbate
in the study room.

287
00:13:31,372 --> 00:13:34,504
I masturbated everywhere.

288
00:13:34,667 --> 00:13:37,632
Everywhere!

289
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:44,094
Confession is good for the soul.

290
00:13:44,385 --> 00:13:45,726
You should try it sometime.

291
00:13:51,684 --> 00:13:54,567
There's another round of questions,
if you'd like to continue.

292
00:13:54,728 --> 00:13:58,608
Give us a moment to sit in our own filth
before you heap another bucket on us.

293
00:13:58,774 --> 00:14:02,321
Strange, after all these years how much
we've kept hidden from each other.

294
00:14:02,611 --> 00:14:05,411
You'd think by now we would
have learned to be better people.

295
00:14:05,573 --> 00:14:09,832
I think we got into this mess by thinking
there was such a thing as better people.

296
00:14:10,411 --> 00:14:12,831
Wait. That's it.

297
00:14:13,622 --> 00:14:16,422
If we're no better than Pierce,
Pierce is no worse than us...

298
00:14:16,584 --> 00:14:19,264
...then that means
nobody's really that bad.

299
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:22,434
So what if we're willing to suffer
and inflict pain...

300
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:25,140
...at the mere prospect
of material reward?

301
00:14:25,301 --> 00:14:27,353
If we stop now,
that doesn't make us better.

302
00:14:27,511 --> 00:14:29,018
It just makes us so dishonest...

303
00:14:29,513 --> 00:14:32,443
...that we would rather be poor
than admit we're flawed.

304
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,480
Pierce admitted he was flawed,
and he died rich.

305
00:14:36,645 --> 00:14:40,358
Let's celebrate his life and death
in the honest way...

306
00:14:40,524 --> 00:14:42,944
...not by saying fake nice things
around a casket...

307
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:48,164
...but by admitting we're monsters and
clawing joyfully for some of his cash.

308
00:14:48,657 --> 00:14:52,880
So does anybody have anything left
before we continue?

309
00:14:53,037 --> 00:14:56,465
Let's empty our tanks of lies
once and for all.

310
00:14:56,624 --> 00:14:58,960
I'm Jeff Winger,
and if I had my choice...

311
00:14:59,126 --> 00:15:02,720
...I would rather look at myself naked
than the women I sleep with.

312
00:15:03,255 --> 00:15:05,841
I'm the one who hit Jeff's Lexus
in the parking lot.

313
00:15:06,008 --> 00:15:07,182
It wasn't a taco truck.

314
00:15:07,343 --> 00:15:10,356
Racist of me to improvise
such an ethnically specific vehicle.

315
00:15:10,513 --> 00:15:13,230
I only give money to homeless people
when I'm with someone.

316
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:15,111
I've never been to Legoland.

317
00:15:15,267 --> 00:15:17,403
I just wanted you guys
to think I was cool.

318
00:15:17,561 --> 00:15:20,065
I can be passive-aggressive
sometimes.

319
00:15:20,523 --> 00:15:22,076
Don't everybody disagree at once.

320
00:15:22,233 --> 00:15:25,246
- Oh, Lord, I did it again.
- When you chew gum I wanna punch you.

321
00:15:25,402 --> 00:15:28,416
May as well have machine guns
in your mouths. Vibrates my skull.

322
00:15:28,572 --> 00:15:29,830
Everybody clear?

323
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:31,201
- Yeah.
- All right.

324
00:15:31,617 --> 00:15:34,417
Mr. Stone,
hit us with your grand finale.

325
00:15:34,578 --> 00:15:37,046
May it be as brutal as we deserve.

326
00:15:37,206 --> 00:15:38,250
Very well.

327
00:15:38,415 --> 00:15:40,586
Mr. Hawthorne's final round
of questions.

328
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:45,765
"Britta Perry. Do you know that you
hate yourself more than you should...

329
00:15:45,923 --> 00:15:47,762
...and that your passion inspired me?"

330
00:15:49,009 --> 00:15:50,053
No.

331
00:15:50,386 --> 00:15:51,857
That's true. She didn't know.

332
00:15:52,012 --> 00:15:54,183
"To Ms. Perry, I leave my iPod nano...

333
00:15:54,807 --> 00:15:57,856
...filled with music to take life
less seriously by."

334
00:15:58,018 --> 00:15:59,940
Oh, that's nice.

335
00:16:00,104 --> 00:16:03,616
"Also this liquid nitrogen cooled
cylinder of my hyper-virile sperm...

336
00:16:03,774 --> 00:16:06,278
...in case your lesbian lifestyle
one day wears out...

337
00:16:06,443 --> 00:16:09,029
...and you wish to raise an army
of geniuses.

338
00:16:09,321 --> 00:16:13,118
Shirley. Did you know you are not only
a credit to your race and gender...

339
00:16:13,284 --> 00:16:16,878
...but to our species? I was intimidated
by your strength of character...

340
00:16:17,037 --> 00:16:18,793
- ...and business acumen?"
- Yes.

341
00:16:18,956 --> 00:16:22,135
"To Shirley Bennett, I leave
my spacious timeshare in Florida...

342
00:16:22,751 --> 00:16:26,382
...where she can take what's-his-name
and however many children she has.

343
00:16:26,547 --> 00:16:29,181
I also leave you
a cylinder of my sperm.

344
00:16:30,134 --> 00:16:34,061
Annie Edison. Did you know
that you were always my favourite?"

345
00:16:34,221 --> 00:16:35,514
You mentioned it once, but...

346
00:16:35,681 --> 00:16:38,944
"I leave you this tiara,
which you once refused to accept.

347
00:16:39,101 --> 00:16:41,865
Same tiara I used to wear when
my mother would assault me...

348
00:16:42,021 --> 00:16:43,611
...for not being a little girl.

349
00:16:43,772 --> 00:16:44,816
Also sperm.

350
00:16:45,733 --> 00:16:46,777
Jeff Winger.

351
00:16:46,942 --> 00:16:48,829
- Did you know you're gay?"
- No.

352
00:16:48,986 --> 00:16:50,374
"Agree to disagree.

353
00:16:50,529 --> 00:16:52,866
To you, I leave this bottle
of fine Scotch...

354
00:16:53,032 --> 00:16:57,338
...so that you're less tempted to
drink this cylinder of even finer sperm.

355
00:16:57,495 --> 00:16:59,713
Abed Nadir.
Did you know that you are insane...

356
00:16:59,872 --> 00:17:02,007
...and nothing you said
made any sense to me?"

357
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:04,005
- Yep.
- "Here's your sperm.

358
00:17:04,168 --> 00:17:05,342
Troy Barnes.

359
00:17:06,003 --> 00:17:09,052
Did you know that you possess
the greatest gift life can give?

360
00:17:09,215 --> 00:17:10,342
The heart of a hero.

361
00:17:11,258 --> 00:17:14,640
And that it's up to you
not to waste it like I did?"

362
00:17:15,846 --> 00:17:16,973
I think.

363
00:17:17,139 --> 00:17:18,979
"To Troy,
I leave the obligatory sperm."

364
00:17:21,185 --> 00:17:23,404
Maybe it's because everyone else
got one...

365
00:17:23,562 --> 00:17:28,865
...and because it's an old man's semen,
but I'm kind of disappointed.

366
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:33,284
"Also, I am prepared to leave
Troy Barnes my remaining shares...

367
00:17:33,447 --> 00:17:38,003
...in the Hawthorne Wipes Company
currently valued at $14.3 million.

368
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,212
On one condition.

369
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:45,672
You must first sail my boat,
the Childish Tycoon...

370
00:17:45,835 --> 00:17:48,303
...by yourself around the entire world."

371
00:17:48,462 --> 00:17:50,550
- What?
- Again with the bait and switch.

372
00:17:50,714 --> 00:17:53,728
"When I was 23, my father asked me
to do the same thing...

373
00:17:53,884 --> 00:17:55,724
...to earn my adulthood
and his fortune.

374
00:17:55,886 --> 00:17:58,105
I cheated
and floated off the coast of Belize...

375
00:17:58,264 --> 00:18:01,396
...for a year doing coke with
John Denver. I always regretted it.

376
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:04,572
I'd like to give you a chance
to do what I never did:

377
00:18:04,979 --> 00:18:07,315
Become your own man."

378
00:18:07,731 --> 00:18:09,285
Okay, I'm a lawyer, Troy.

379
00:18:09,441 --> 00:18:13,155
It should be possible to contest
these conditions as unreasonable.

380
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,038
Pierce can take his mind games,
his sperm and he can put...

381
00:18:16,198 --> 00:18:18,250
- I'll do it.
- What?

382
00:18:20,035 --> 00:18:21,079
Troy?

383
00:18:21,245 --> 00:18:24,591
Pierce was a crazy old coot, yeah...

384
00:18:24,748 --> 00:18:28,509
...but I think he knew something about
me that even I didn't know until now.

385
00:18:28,669 --> 00:18:33,593
Because he's offering me something
I've been searching for my whole life.

386
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:38,263
Millions of dollars.

387
00:18:38,429 --> 00:18:41,442
And being a man or whatever he said.

388
00:18:41,807 --> 00:18:43,895
Jeff, say something.

389
00:18:46,145 --> 00:18:47,438
I'm speechless.

390
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:52,739
Somebody say something. Abed?

391
00:18:56,614 --> 00:18:58,085
Cool.

392
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,043
Cool, cool, cool.

393
00:19:00,367 --> 00:19:02,088
That's a lie.

394
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,516
And then that sperm came down.

395
00:19:14,673 --> 00:19:16,643
I mean, I couldn't say anything.

396
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,141
But, oh, my God.

397
00:19:18,302 --> 00:19:19,856
I was gonna explode.

398
00:19:20,012 --> 00:19:22,646
And then that one, that last question...

399
00:19:22,806 --> 00:19:25,440
...with all of that nice stuff
out on the table.

400
00:19:25,601 --> 00:19:28,401
You were having this discussion
about whether or not to quit?

401
00:19:28,562 --> 00:19:30,283
At first, I was like:

402
00:19:31,106 --> 00:19:32,281
But you did it.

403
00:19:32,441 --> 00:19:33,652
You did it.

404
00:19:33,818 --> 00:19:35,455
It was amazing.

405
00:19:35,611 --> 00:19:36,952
You're amazing, man.

406
00:19:37,112 --> 00:19:40,161
You're amazing. Guys, this is the best.

407
00:19:40,324 --> 00:19:42,459
We should do this every week.

408
00:19:42,618 --> 00:19:44,588
Oh, I'm a fun guy, you know?

409
00:19:44,745 --> 00:19:46,667
I mean, you talk about lying?

410
00:19:46,831 --> 00:19:48,171
I was lying the whole time.

411
00:19:48,332 --> 00:19:50,420
This is who I really am. This is me.

412
00:19:50,584 --> 00:19:52,755
This is the real me. I'm artistic.

413
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,432
Ideas come to me all the time.

414
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,512
I have this idea for a movie.

415
00:19:58,676 --> 00:20:01,357
It's about this guy
who oversees polygraph tests...

416
00:20:01,512 --> 00:20:04,098
...and the biggest obstacle
is how good-looking he is.

417
00:20:04,265 --> 00:20:06,601
People can't focus and tell the truth.

418
00:20:06,767 --> 00:20:07,978
It's unbelievable.

419
00:20:08,644 --> 00:20:12,191
By the way, we never found out
how Pierce died.

420
00:20:12,356 --> 00:20:15,322
Oh, my God.
I can't believe I didn't tell you yet.

421
00:20:15,484 --> 00:20:19,874
It was dehydration from filling up
all of those cylinders.

422
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:23,293
I mean, it's how I wanna go,
but, hey, I'm a little nutty.

423
00:20:25,077 --> 00:20:27,581
Are you guys thinking
what I'm thinking?

424
00:20:27,746 --> 00:20:29,716
