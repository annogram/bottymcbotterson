1
00:00:04,193 --> 00:00:07,195
even, what, two months
after being kicked out

2
00:00:07,197 --> 00:00:09,477
of you know where.

3
00:00:09,534 --> 00:00:10,814
Yeah, good thing I came up

4
00:00:10,852 --> 00:00:12,271
with this idea
for potluck dinners.

5
00:00:12,319 --> 00:00:13,919
Pierce, all you said was,
"I'm hungry."

6
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:15,670
All Henry Ford said was,
"I need a ride."

7
00:00:15,672 --> 00:00:18,257
Troy, is that a casserole?

8
00:00:18,257 --> 00:00:19,094
It's bagel bites

9
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:20,814
in a deconstructed
hot pocket reduction

10
00:00:20,867 --> 00:00:22,067
with a doritos glaze.

11
00:00:22,091 --> 00:00:24,044
I just really want
to make my food, you know.

12
00:00:24,047 --> 00:00:27,099
Did anybody bring anything
that isn't poison?

13
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,969
I need to eat
natural, organic foods,

14
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:32,454
or I'm never gonna get rid
of this hangover.

15
00:00:32,454 --> 00:00:33,722
Jeff, what'd you bring?

16
00:00:33,722 --> 00:00:35,557
Pack of lifesavers.

17
00:00:36,593 --> 00:00:38,109
Sorry.
Dead battery.

18
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,761
Where's Abed?

19
00:00:39,762 --> 00:00:41,229
Have you seen Abed?

20
00:00:41,231 --> 00:00:43,716
He's probably out getting
something really cool

21
00:00:43,716 --> 00:00:45,267
for the dinner.

22
00:00:45,268 --> 00:00:51,240
See? Cool.
Abed brought delicious police.

23
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,209
Abed, what happened?

24
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:54,576
Found your friend going
through the dumpster

25
00:00:54,578 --> 00:00:56,777
outside the administration
building in Greendale again.

26
00:00:56,779 --> 00:01:01,216
This cadet could use a lesson
in intergalactic protocol.

27
00:01:01,218 --> 00:01:02,334
It's okay, officer.

28
00:01:02,335 --> 00:01:04,453
He's just playing a character
from TV.

29
00:01:04,453 --> 00:01:07,590
Oh, yes, I'm very familiar
with Inspector Spacetime.

30
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,623
You think a guy becomes a cop

31
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:10,259
because his prom night
was a dream?

32
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,179
If this were comic-con,
I'd take a bullet for that kid.

33
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,647
But, here in the real world,
trespassing is a crime.

34
00:01:15,649 --> 00:01:16,814
We're sorry, officer.

35
00:01:16,816 --> 00:01:19,067
Our friend has been having
a hard time

36
00:01:19,069 --> 00:01:22,403
adjusting to being expelled
from Greendale.

37
00:01:22,405 --> 00:01:24,390
- It won't happen again.
- That's for sure.

38
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,475
I talked to your former Dean.
I recommended he press charges.

39
00:01:27,477 --> 00:01:28,576
He said he'd hold off

40
00:01:28,578 --> 00:01:30,811
on the condition that you set
an appointment with this guy.

41
00:01:30,813 --> 00:01:32,164
He's offering to foot

42
00:01:32,164 --> 00:01:33,781
the bill for the consultation
himself.

43
00:01:33,783 --> 00:01:35,167
It's the number
for a psychiatrist.

44
00:01:35,168 --> 00:01:37,319
What? No.
Abed's not crazy.

45
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:39,587
Where does the Dean get off?
He's not the real Dean.

46
00:01:39,588 --> 00:01:41,456
He's been replaced
by an identical life-form

47
00:01:41,457 --> 00:01:42,908
for some nefarious purpose.

48
00:01:42,908 --> 00:01:44,793
Reggie, to the time booth.

49
00:01:44,793 --> 00:01:46,844
We haven't much...
space.

50
00:01:46,846 --> 00:01:49,965
I'll be right there, Inspector.

51
00:01:49,966 --> 00:01:52,668
Hey, before I go, you really
shouldn't be using this

52
00:01:52,668 --> 00:01:54,436
to prop open
your building's door.

53
00:01:54,436 --> 00:01:55,938
This is an antique fire brick.

54
00:01:55,938 --> 00:01:57,555
I'd say pre-civil war.

55
00:01:57,557 --> 00:02:01,310
Note the uneven orange hue
and the embossment on the back.

56
00:02:01,311 --> 00:02:03,361
What a nifty little piece
of americana.

57
00:02:03,362 --> 00:02:07,115
You could get 50, 60 bucks
for it from the right collector.

58
00:02:07,117 --> 00:02:08,850
<i>I watch a lot
of antiques roadshow.</i>

59
00:02:08,852 --> 00:02:11,135
Oh.

60
00:02:11,137 --> 00:02:14,122
Anyway, walk to your cars
in pairs tonight.

61
00:02:14,123 --> 00:02:17,009
Rape's up 8%.

62
00:02:18,527 --> 00:02:21,963
$60?

63
00:02:21,965 --> 00:02:24,415
Hello?
Rich people, Troy's joining you.

64
00:02:24,417 --> 00:02:25,967
Yes, I'll hold.

Abed.

74
00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:01,986
I'm Dr. Heidi.

75
00:03:01,987 --> 00:03:03,705
We're going to have
a little chat tonight,

76
00:03:03,706 --> 00:03:04,956
you and I.
How does that sound?

77
00:03:04,957 --> 00:03:06,061
I don't need therapy.

78
00:03:06,109 --> 00:03:08,067
Well, that's
a perfectly normal response.

79
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:10,191
I concur
with Dr. Heidi's diagnosis.

80
00:03:10,513 --> 00:03:12,181
I haven't diagnosed
anything yet.

81
00:03:12,181 --> 00:03:14,104
Psych major.
Got your back, brah.

82
00:03:15,576 --> 00:03:19,978
I have to say, I didn't expect
to see so many of you.

83
00:03:20,389 --> 00:03:22,775
Abed won't go to any kind
of doctor on his own.

84
00:03:22,776 --> 00:03:23,776
We caught him last year

85
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,544
trying to remove
his own tonsils.

86
00:03:25,545 --> 00:03:27,695
Well, why don't you let me
take it from here?

87
00:03:27,697 --> 00:03:28,881
You have to understand
about Abed.

88
00:03:28,882 --> 00:03:30,765
He's usually,
you know, adorable weird,

89
00:03:30,766 --> 00:03:33,384
like mork from ork,
but, since we got expelled,

90
00:03:33,385 --> 00:03:36,237
he's been creepy weird,
like present-day Robin Williams.

91
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,272
- I'm not crazy.
- Well, Abed,

92
00:03:38,274 --> 00:03:40,241
I don't deal in crazy.

93
00:03:40,242 --> 00:03:42,276
- I deal in health.
- Hmm.

94
00:03:42,277 --> 00:03:45,913
So how long has Abed needed
a crazy amount of help?

95
00:03:48,884 --> 00:03:54,288
All of this behavior
started after you were expelled?

96
00:03:54,289 --> 00:03:57,141
There may have been
a ramp-up.

97
00:03:59,062 --> 00:04:01,263
It's okay, buddy.

98
00:04:01,264 --> 00:04:03,264
Just a few more minutes, and
we're good until spring, okay?

99
00:04:03,265 --> 00:04:04,800
But it doesn't make any sense.

100
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,068
Think of it this way.

101
00:04:06,068 --> 00:04:08,403
We get the hour back
later in the year.

102
00:04:08,405 --> 00:04:11,407
Yeah.

103
00:04:11,407 --> 00:04:13,074
<i>I "Rent Tower Heist"
last night,</i>

104
00:04:13,075 --> 00:04:14,643
and I won't spoil the ending,
but let me tell you,

105
00:04:14,644 --> 00:04:16,829
it was quite
the hilarious Thrill Ride.

106
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:20,365
That Brett Ratner, he's a master
at comedic action-adventure.

107
00:04:20,367 --> 00:04:23,035
Mm.
A master at storytelling.

108
00:04:23,036 --> 00:04:25,286
He's just a master
at making movies in general.

109
00:04:25,288 --> 00:04:27,656
I'm gonna say it.
He's the new Spielberg.

110
00:04:27,656 --> 00:04:30,826
Oh!

111
00:04:30,826 --> 00:04:32,543
I have to go.
Excuse me.

112
00:04:32,545 --> 00:04:34,463
Okay.

113
00:04:34,463 --> 00:04:40,334
You're a bad person.
You're a bad person.

114
00:04:40,336 --> 00:04:43,471
Time enough at last
to eat a sandwich.

115
00:04:43,473 --> 00:04:45,023
Though even he knew
that this sandwich

116
00:04:45,024 --> 00:04:46,975
was nearer his last sandwich
than his first.

117
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,110
Abed, I'm trying to eat.

118
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,345
He said, oldly,

119
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,093
his brittle bones straining
to support the weight

120
00:04:51,101 --> 00:04:53,526
of his wrinkly skin.

121
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,488
Stop narrating me.

122
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:57,702
He shouted to no one,

123
00:04:57,704 --> 00:04:59,036
just a man alone in time
with nothing

124
00:04:59,038 --> 00:05:01,456
but the cold squishiness
of tuna salad to comfort him.

125
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:02,908
I take it back.

126
00:05:02,908 --> 00:05:04,877
I don't want
to be in your novel.

127
00:05:04,877 --> 00:05:07,028
Pierce Hawthorne had nearly
lost his grip on reality.

128
00:05:07,028 --> 00:05:08,797
Lately, he'd begun to think
he was in a novel.

129
00:05:08,798 --> 00:05:12,418
And action.

130
00:05:12,418 --> 00:05:14,369
Abed, what the hell
are you doing?

131
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,036
Cut. We got it.
One more for safety.

132
00:05:16,038 --> 00:05:17,271
Abed, it's 4:30
in the morning,

133
00:05:17,273 --> 00:05:18,540
and you're in my bedroom.

134
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,540
Use that.
Okay.

135
00:05:19,542 --> 00:05:21,310
And action.

136
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,379
But that's almost completely
nearly all of it.

137
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:26,264
If Abed is as sick
as you all say,

138
00:05:26,266 --> 00:05:27,598
then I have no...
Wait a minute.

139
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,218
Nobody in this room
gets to define sick.

140
00:05:30,218 --> 00:05:31,353
I do.

141
00:05:31,353 --> 00:05:32,821
I'm a psychiatrist.

142
00:05:32,822 --> 00:05:34,856
Any kind of doctor can really.

143
00:05:34,858 --> 00:05:36,057
- Really?
- Yes.

144
00:05:36,057 --> 00:05:37,358
Well, if Abed's sick,

145
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,661
then we're all sick.
Yeah.

146
00:05:39,661 --> 00:05:41,279
You can't determine
a person's sanity

147
00:05:41,281 --> 00:05:42,898
from a few amusing stories.

148
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:44,332
- Exactly.
- That's right.

149
00:05:44,334 --> 00:05:47,034
I mean, if anything,
Abed's more sane than any of us.

150
00:05:47,036 --> 00:05:48,069
Yeah. Well.

151
00:05:48,069 --> 00:05:50,923
I mean, he's certainly
the craziest one of us,

152
00:05:50,923 --> 00:05:55,961
but, you know, we're all
kind of crazy-town banana pants.

153
00:05:55,961 --> 00:05:58,430
Talk to me
about crazy-town banana pants.

154
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,098
Look, we're just saying
it's been a crazy year

155
00:06:00,098 --> 00:06:01,233
for everybody.

156
00:06:01,233 --> 00:06:03,134
Who among us hasn't had
the odd banana

157
00:06:03,136 --> 00:06:04,636
in his or her pants, right?

158
00:06:04,637 --> 00:06:06,254
I have.

159
00:06:13,312 --> 00:06:17,699
How long does peyote last?
Just asking for a friend.

160
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:21,603
♪ Troy and Abed and Annie
in the morning ♪

161
00:06:21,603 --> 00:06:22,870
What are you doing?

162
00:06:22,872 --> 00:06:24,206
Nothing.

163
00:06:24,206 --> 00:06:25,339
Nothing my ass.

164
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:27,274
What are all these cameras
doing here?

165
00:06:31,713 --> 00:06:34,048
Here, take my coat.

166
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,500
Oh.

167
00:06:35,502 --> 00:06:37,386
Thank you.

168
00:06:37,387 --> 00:06:39,954
That's so sweet.

169
00:06:39,956 --> 00:06:41,923
Just don't eat anything
or drink anything,

170
00:06:41,925 --> 00:06:44,927
and no sweating
or bending at the elbows,

171
00:06:44,927 --> 00:06:47,795
and no chairs with backrests,
and if you take it off,

172
00:06:47,797 --> 00:06:51,567
wooden hangers only.

173
00:06:51,567 --> 00:06:53,634
You're probably
warm now, right?

174
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:58,740
Good news, guys.

175
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,158
I spent all my money.

176
00:07:00,158 --> 00:07:01,810
Troy, you can't bring that
in here.

177
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:03,644
Yes, I can.
It's all-terrain, dummy.

178
00:07:03,646 --> 00:07:05,363
I made a plate of cookies
for the study group,

179
00:07:05,365 --> 00:07:06,665
but my boys ate them,

180
00:07:06,665 --> 00:07:08,449
so since they took something
of yours,

181
00:07:08,451 --> 00:07:10,369
you all get something
of theirs.

182
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,170
Elijah loves this, Britta.

183
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,822
There you go, Jeff.
There you go, Troy.

184
00:07:13,822 --> 00:07:15,824
There you go, Pierce.

185
00:07:15,824 --> 00:07:19,177
Karate championship,
second place!

186
00:07:19,177 --> 00:07:20,928
Now I'll be unstoppable.

187
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:23,163
Oyay!

188
00:07:23,165 --> 00:07:24,800
So you see
what you call insanity

189
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,552
we call solidarity.

190
00:07:26,552 --> 00:07:27,769
I'm sorry.

191
00:07:27,769 --> 00:07:29,855
We just finished telling him
about it,

192
00:07:29,855 --> 00:07:31,189
and you grab it and squeeze it?

193
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:33,173
- I said I was sorry.
- Uh-huh.

194
00:07:33,175 --> 00:07:36,228
And so as a group,
do you always indulge Abed

195
00:07:36,228 --> 00:07:38,346
in these little misadventures?

196
00:07:38,346 --> 00:07:39,480
Take that back.

197
00:07:39,481 --> 00:07:44,351
Our adventures are very manly.

198
00:07:44,353 --> 00:07:45,853
I have to say
there's more important

199
00:07:45,855 --> 00:07:47,822
to mental health
than a support system.

200
00:07:47,824 --> 00:07:49,490
And assuming
that this group is,

201
00:07:49,492 --> 00:07:52,110
for Abed, said support system,

202
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,161
I think I've heard everything
I need to hear

203
00:07:54,163 --> 00:07:56,281
in order to make a decision.

204
00:07:56,281 --> 00:07:58,516
I think
that Abed should be committed.

205
00:08:00,185 --> 00:08:03,038
You mean committed
to his character work, right?

206
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:05,372
Because he already is.
Abed, show him your Don Draper.

207
00:08:05,374 --> 00:08:06,807
Cigarettes.

208
00:08:06,809 --> 00:08:10,095
No, I mean an institution.

209
00:08:10,096 --> 00:08:11,779
You mean like marriage?

210
00:08:11,781 --> 00:08:13,264
I mean a mental institution.

211
00:08:13,266 --> 00:08:15,166
Ah. So do I.

212
00:08:15,168 --> 00:08:17,218
Will someone please help me
lighten the mood?

213
00:08:22,442 --> 00:08:24,957
Please,
Mr. Dr. psychiatrist, sir,

214
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:28,262
please don't send my best friend
to crazy people jail.

215
00:08:28,314 --> 00:08:29,814
Relax.
He doesn't have the right.

216
00:08:29,814 --> 00:08:31,031
Abed's not dangerous.

217
00:08:31,033 --> 00:08:33,768
Yeah, he's just unique,
like a snowflake

218
00:08:33,769 --> 00:08:35,102
who gets bent out of shape

219
00:08:35,104 --> 00:08:36,738
<i>when you mix up Star Wars
and space treks.</i>

220
00:08:36,739 --> 00:08:38,840
Or a serial killer's signature.

221
00:08:38,841 --> 00:08:40,290
I'm a psych major.

222
00:08:40,292 --> 00:08:42,726
His continued obsession
with Greendale Community College

223
00:08:42,727 --> 00:08:44,712
suggests the potential
for escalation.

224
00:08:44,713 --> 00:08:46,630
And, frankly, these stories
you've been telling me

225
00:08:46,631 --> 00:08:47,966
are very troubling.

226
00:08:47,966 --> 00:08:49,299
You're troubled?

227
00:08:49,301 --> 00:08:51,052
I don't remember
any of those things happening.

228
00:08:51,052 --> 00:08:53,370
Since when do these three
live together?

229
00:08:53,371 --> 00:08:54,705
Look, Abed's obsession
with Greendale

230
00:08:54,706 --> 00:08:55,807
doesn't make him crazy.

231
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,008
If you had gone
to school there,

232
00:08:57,009 --> 00:08:58,209
you'd be obsessed with it too.

233
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:59,727
It was a messed-up place.

234
00:08:59,729 --> 00:09:01,129
- We had lockers.
- Yeah.

235
00:09:01,129 --> 00:09:02,764
We're survivors.

236
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:07,051
My name is Pwofussa Wobinswin.

237
00:09:07,052 --> 00:09:09,437
Who's weady to wearn?

238
00:09:09,437 --> 00:09:13,024
Dean, this is not the way
to agree on parking

239
00:09:13,024 --> 00:09:15,559
for the job fair!
It's inhumane.

240
00:09:15,561 --> 00:09:17,028
You have a better idea, Britta?

241
00:09:17,028 --> 00:09:19,831
Yes.
Thousands of them.

242
00:09:19,831 --> 00:09:22,616
Vicki to Queen 3.

243
00:09:22,618 --> 00:09:24,568
Neigh.

244
00:09:30,509 --> 00:09:33,411
That's all for today.
Read chapter four.

245
00:09:37,133 --> 00:09:39,517
Okay, we're
just gonna ignore that.

246
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:51,980
- Bananas?
- Yes.

247
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,431
- Toast?
- Yes.

248
00:09:53,432 --> 00:09:55,149
- Bubble gum?
- Yes.

249
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,600
- Pancakes?
- Yes.

250
00:09:56,601 --> 00:09:59,571
- Fries?
- Get out.

251
00:09:59,572 --> 00:10:01,873
Get out.

252
00:10:01,874 --> 00:10:05,043
There's one every year.
I will not tolerate clowning.

253
00:10:05,043 --> 00:10:06,610
- Car keys?
- Yes.

254
00:10:06,611 --> 00:10:12,250
Okay, last bathroom break.
We've got to cram for...

255
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,951
Excuse me, sir,
can we get to our...

256
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,340
Slow your bones, Rufus.

257
00:10:19,341 --> 00:10:21,958
We got a long road tomorrow.

258
00:10:22,977 --> 00:10:25,312
Welcome...

259
00:10:28,734 --> 00:10:30,434
to ladders.

260
00:10:32,904 --> 00:10:35,072
Interesting.

261
00:10:35,073 --> 00:10:36,407
Eh.

262
00:10:36,408 --> 00:10:38,610
Just wanted to see
if we got the same thing.

263
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:41,580
It sounds as though this
Greendale had quite an effect

264
00:10:41,592 --> 00:10:42,811
on all of you.

265
00:10:42,844 --> 00:10:44,837
You should all definitely
stop dwelling on it

266
00:10:44,866 --> 00:10:45,917
if you want to be healthy.

267
00:10:45,918 --> 00:10:48,253
Well, come on,
it wasn't all bad.

268
00:10:48,254 --> 00:10:50,504
I was there longer than anybody,
and I'm fine.

269
00:10:50,505 --> 00:10:51,673
How are you?

270
00:10:51,673 --> 00:10:53,124
Why do you ask?
3:30.

271
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,342
Uh-oh.

272
00:10:55,344 --> 00:10:56,376
What Pierce was saying

273
00:10:56,378 --> 00:10:58,629
before he started sundowning
is true.

274
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,965
We can't just pass
the crazy buck to Greendale.

275
00:11:00,966 --> 00:11:02,600
It could be a good place too.

276
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,668
That really doesn't matter.

277
00:11:03,668 --> 00:11:05,019
Yeah, we have a lot of memories

278
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:06,770
of Greendale
being in our corner.

279
00:11:06,772 --> 00:11:07,855
Dean-a-ling.

280
00:11:07,856 --> 00:11:09,139
I just wanted to drop by

281
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,058
and tell you we ought
to be hot-stepping it out

282
00:11:11,059 --> 00:11:14,010
to the parking lot
in a brisk, but orderly fashion.

283
00:11:14,011 --> 00:11:15,062
Is there a fire drill?

284
00:11:15,063 --> 00:11:16,614
No, sir,
there's an actual fire.

285
00:11:16,615 --> 00:11:18,149
I wanted you guys
to be the first to know

286
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:19,450
before I tell everyone else.

287
00:11:19,451 --> 00:11:21,286
I know. It's not right
to play favorites,

288
00:11:21,287 --> 00:11:23,037
but it is no more right
to sit on your feelings,

289
00:11:23,038 --> 00:11:24,572
and I don't know
what I'd do without you guys.

290
00:11:24,572 --> 00:11:25,706
Whoa.

291
00:11:25,707 --> 00:11:27,991
Okay, fire, fire!
There's a fire!

292
00:11:37,302 --> 00:11:38,503
Darcy, you've got a cold.

293
00:11:38,504 --> 00:11:41,038
- I feel fine.
- You're sick. Go home!

294
00:11:41,038 --> 00:11:42,423
Get out of here.
Get out of here.

295
00:11:42,423 --> 00:11:44,308
Get out of here.
Get out of here!

296
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:47,144
I can't believe we got here
too late for pizza.

297
00:11:47,145 --> 00:11:48,879
Worst pizza day ever.

298
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:50,181
Oh, darn it.

299
00:11:50,182 --> 00:11:54,851
What am I gonna do
with all this garbage?

300
00:11:54,852 --> 00:11:58,188
Psst, it's me, the Dean.

301
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:02,225
I pulled the last six pieces
of pizza for you.

302
00:12:02,226 --> 00:12:04,195
Ohh.

303
00:12:04,196 --> 00:12:06,447
Back to garbage detail.

304
00:12:06,447 --> 00:12:09,232
We have a few students
with birthdays today,

305
00:12:09,234 --> 00:12:11,336
but, hey, why single them out?

306
00:12:11,336 --> 00:12:12,470
What about the students

307
00:12:12,471 --> 00:12:14,087
who aren't celebrating
anything at all?

308
00:12:14,089 --> 00:12:16,707
Are they any less special?

309
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:20,244
♪ Troy and Jeffrey ♪

310
00:12:20,245 --> 00:12:22,179

students in the world ♪

314
00:12:33,057 --> 00:12:35,559
Damn it.
Out of slugs.

315
00:12:35,561 --> 00:12:37,729
Next time, I'll put you square,

316
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:40,597
you pickle-sucking
MacGillycuddy.

317
00:12:40,599 --> 00:12:43,234
Why did you save me, Dean?

318
00:12:43,235 --> 00:12:46,453
I know how important
paintball is to you, Abed.

319
00:12:46,455 --> 00:12:48,072
I wanted you to win.

320
00:12:48,072 --> 00:12:50,207
It's not important anymore.
I get it now.

321
00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:52,610
It just feels forced.

322
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:55,111
You just enjoy your prize...

323
00:12:55,113 --> 00:12:58,048
Free tickets to...

324
00:12:58,049 --> 00:12:59,950
<i>to see 'Chicago"
at the Greendale Civic Center...</i>

325
00:13:01,952 --> 00:13:06,224
with George Wendt and...

326
00:13:06,225 --> 00:13:10,595
Stefanie Powers.

327
00:13:11,897 --> 00:13:16,400
Lame!

328
00:13:16,402 --> 00:13:17,884
Okay.

329
00:13:17,885 --> 00:13:19,302
That was great,

330
00:13:19,303 --> 00:13:21,188
but you really didn't need
to go into it.

331
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:22,807
You know what occurs to me?

332
00:13:22,807 --> 00:13:25,860
What all those great Greendale
memories have in common?

333
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,860
I was barely in them?

334
00:13:26,861 --> 00:13:28,229
They were all
about Dean Pelton.

335
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,397
That's what I've been trying
to make

336
00:13:29,398 --> 00:13:30,831
you guys understand
for the last two months.

337
00:13:30,832 --> 00:13:32,250
I keep telling you,

338
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,668
we weren't expelled
by the real Dean.

339
00:13:33,668 --> 00:13:35,586
It couldn't have been him.
He loved us.

340
00:13:35,586 --> 00:13:38,489
Maybe we've been so concerned
with moving past Greendale,

341
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,073
we've been living in denial.

342
00:13:40,075 --> 00:13:42,543
It's true.
I mean, let's face it.

343
00:13:42,543 --> 00:13:45,078
We weren't driven crazy
by Greendale.

344
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,633
And Abed's not the crazy one
for obsessing about it.

345
00:13:48,634 --> 00:13:50,717
Abed, we're sorry.
We haven't been supporting you,

346
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,937
and we haven't been honest
with ourselves.

347
00:13:52,937 --> 00:13:55,306
Dr. Heidi, something weird
is going on with that school.

348
00:13:55,307 --> 00:13:59,342
Abed doesn't need to be here.
We need to be there.

349
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:02,113
But there is no there.

350
00:14:02,114 --> 00:14:04,514
That's the problem.
That's why we have to go back.

351
00:14:04,515 --> 00:14:06,783
No, you can't go back
to Greendale.

352
00:14:06,784 --> 00:14:08,152
Why?
Because it isn't healthy?

353
00:14:08,153 --> 00:14:11,788
'Cause it doesn't exist.

354
00:14:12,857 --> 00:14:14,859
I parked by a meter.

355
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,628
Any of y'all park by a meter?

356
00:14:17,629 --> 00:14:18,926
Wait, what?

357
00:14:24,176 --> 00:14:26,143
What you mean,
Greendale doesn't exist?

358
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:28,443
Well, there is a place
called Greendale,

359
00:14:28,469 --> 00:14:30,803
and you all spent
three years there,

360
00:14:30,821 --> 00:14:33,956
but it was
not a community college.

361
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:41,520
These memories that you people
have been sharing

362
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:44,881
are a shared psychosis.

363
00:14:44,945 --> 00:14:46,211
You were patients there
together,

364
00:14:46,212 --> 00:14:48,518
you were released together,
and I am alarmed to see

365
00:14:48,534 --> 00:14:51,638
that you are now relapsing
together.

366
00:14:51,671 --> 00:14:53,667
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

367
00:14:53,691 --> 00:14:56,576
This is not real.
You're lying.

368
00:14:56,607 --> 00:14:59,326
Search your mind
for the real memories.

369
00:14:59,509 --> 00:15:02,227
Try to look past the trauma
you've been blocking out.

370
00:15:02,229 --> 00:15:04,355
- What trauma?
- You all came

371
00:15:04,368 --> 00:15:06,677
to this community college

372
00:15:06,701 --> 00:15:08,177
after your lives had fractured.

373
00:15:08,268 --> 00:15:10,514
Pill addiction,
failed legal career,

374
00:15:10,832 --> 00:15:13,719
broken marriage,
lost scholarship,

375
00:15:13,932 --> 00:15:15,407
- old.
- Enough!

376
00:15:15,442 --> 00:15:17,187
I don't want to hear mine.

377
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:19,293
And, if we were going
to fabricate a delusion,

378
00:15:19,427 --> 00:15:22,116
why would we fabricate
a community college?

379
00:15:22,133 --> 00:15:26,163
Ah, yes, this fantastical
community college

380
00:15:26,187 --> 00:15:29,278
where everything that happens
is unbelievably ridiculous

381
00:15:29,293 --> 00:15:32,346
and it all revolves
around you as a group.

382
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:35,552
The same reason anyone plunges
into psychosis, miss Perry.

383
00:15:35,664 --> 00:15:37,716
It was a mentally-compatible
alternative

384
00:15:37,787 --> 00:15:39,903
to your grim reality.

385
00:15:45,246 --> 00:15:47,480
Can you believe the secret
trampoline we found?

386
00:15:47,501 --> 00:15:49,834
I know.
It's so great.

387
00:15:58,008 --> 00:15:59,290
For Greendale!

388
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,405
Charge!

389
00:16:01,437 --> 00:16:02,720
Come on, Leonard.

390
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,274
- Yow!
- Ooh!

- Harrison Ford.

398
00:16:18,674 --> 00:16:19,975
- Remember when we went camping?
- Yes.

399
00:16:19,975 --> 00:16:21,143
Remember when we painted
the nursery?

400
00:16:21,144 --> 00:16:22,561
- Yes.
- Remember when we remembered

401
00:16:22,562 --> 00:16:24,139
going camping
while we were in the nursery?

402
00:16:27,225 --> 00:16:29,813
I'm a millionaire,
I'm an inventor,

403
00:16:29,852 --> 00:16:32,822
I'm a legend,
and I had sex with Eartha Kitt.

404
00:16:32,822 --> 00:16:33,989
It's sad.

405
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,490
Should we increase
their lithium?

406
00:16:35,491 --> 00:16:36,557
Not yet.

407
00:16:36,558 --> 00:16:38,159
I want to see what happens

408
00:16:38,161 --> 00:16:40,495
if we confiscate
one of their pens.

409
00:16:45,501 --> 00:16:49,955
- It's not possible.
- Mm.

410
00:16:49,956 --> 00:16:54,275
You say you started
as a Spanish study group.

411
00:16:54,277 --> 00:16:55,760
Do any of you speak Spanish?

412
00:16:55,761 --> 00:16:58,297
<i>Mi hambre es bombero tirantes.</i>

413
00:16:58,298 --> 00:16:59,914
And you've attended Greendale
for three years,

414
00:16:59,915 --> 00:17:02,717
but don't community colleges
end after two?

415
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,519
Everyone's always saying that.

416
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,021
The average community college
student attends school

417
00:17:07,022 --> 00:17:08,223
five to seven years.

418
00:17:08,224 --> 00:17:09,724
Many offer four-year degrees.

419
00:17:09,726 --> 00:17:11,527
In your mind, they do.

420
00:17:11,528 --> 00:17:12,811
In your mind.

421
00:17:12,813 --> 00:17:16,597
And you shared this delusion
with each other, like that time

422
00:17:16,598 --> 00:17:18,200
all those people
got into swing dance music

423
00:17:18,201 --> 00:17:19,351
back in the '90s.

424
00:17:19,352 --> 00:17:21,088
And then you were released,

425
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:22,767
probably because your insurance
ran out.

426
00:17:22,807 --> 00:17:25,319
But the official story
is that you're now fit

427
00:17:25,357 --> 00:17:27,826
to live within society again.

428
00:17:27,827 --> 00:17:30,962
You just have to accept
the truth.

429
00:17:41,758 --> 00:17:43,759
Wait.

430
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:45,427
Give me a break.

431
00:17:45,429 --> 00:17:47,179
That made no sense.

432
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,180
Yeah, it's me.

433
00:17:48,181 --> 00:17:49,981
No, I think they bought it.

434
00:17:49,982 --> 00:17:51,317
I had to do a little riffing
at the end,

435
00:17:51,317 --> 00:17:54,019
but I was pretty convincing.

436
00:17:54,019 --> 00:17:56,905
Well, if it looks like I'm
sneaking out the window,

437
00:17:56,906 --> 00:17:59,325
it's just a symptom
of your deepening psychosis.

438
00:17:59,326 --> 00:18:01,777
- Don't hurt me.
- Greendale doesn't exist?

439
00:18:01,778 --> 00:18:03,362
How long did you think
we'd buy that?

440
00:18:03,363 --> 00:18:05,498
I'm literally carrying
a Greendale backpack.

441
00:18:05,499 --> 00:18:07,333
I have, like, 1,000 pictures
of the campus on my phone.

442
00:18:07,334 --> 00:18:08,834
I have children
I see every day.

443
00:18:08,835 --> 00:18:10,806
I have definitely
not been locked up.

444
00:18:10,867 --> 00:18:11,888
Get him.

445
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:15,094
Why would you lie to make us
think we were crazy?

446
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:16,476
Because, Ms. Edison,

447
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,376
Greendale is purgatory,

448
00:18:18,377 --> 00:18:20,429
and I am the devil.

449
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:22,631
- What?
- I knew it.

450
00:18:22,632 --> 00:18:25,718
Stop letting him
make you realize stuff.

451
00:18:25,719 --> 00:18:27,102
These aren't even good lies.

452
00:18:27,103 --> 00:18:28,804
All right, fine,
I had to come up with something.

453
00:18:28,805 --> 00:18:30,556
- You were getting too close.
- Close to what?

454
00:18:30,557 --> 00:18:31,773
To the truth.

455
00:18:31,775 --> 00:18:32,892
The Indian kid was right.

456
00:18:32,893 --> 00:18:34,292
- He's Arabic.
- Also Polish.

457
00:18:34,294 --> 00:18:35,693
Whatever.
I'm a fake psychiatrist,

458
00:18:35,694 --> 00:18:36,811
not a fake ethnologist.

459
00:18:36,813 --> 00:18:38,646
The point
is your Dean was kidnapped

460
00:18:38,647 --> 00:18:40,065
by Ben Chang and replaced

461
00:18:40,066 --> 00:18:41,232
with a double.

462
00:18:41,233 --> 00:18:42,701
I was hired
to keep you off the scent.

463
00:18:42,701 --> 00:18:44,286
Chang kidnapped the Dean?

464
00:18:44,287 --> 00:18:45,621
Even for him, that's insane.

465
00:18:45,622 --> 00:18:47,490
Is it?
Think about it.

466
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:57,333
Whoo!
I said hot damn!

467
00:18:57,334 --> 00:19:00,336
Chang...

468
00:19:00,336 --> 00:19:01,670
What are you doing?

469
00:19:01,671 --> 00:19:03,255
I'm predicting future crimes.

470
00:19:04,257 --> 00:19:05,840
Now I'm sick.

471
00:19:05,842 --> 00:19:07,893
See, you said
that would happen.

472
00:19:07,894 --> 00:19:09,511
You are a pre-cog!

473
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:21,990
Again.

474
00:19:25,111 --> 00:19:27,729
You're weak.

475
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:29,615
Uh, guys,

476
00:19:29,615 --> 00:19:31,200
while we were remembering
Chang is crazy,

477
00:19:31,201 --> 00:19:32,634
the fake doctor sneaked away.

478
00:19:32,635 --> 00:19:34,002
- Oh, crap!
- What?

479
00:19:34,003 --> 00:19:35,871
There goes our only chance
of clearing our names.

480
00:19:35,872 --> 00:19:38,673
You guys, forget about us.
The Dean has been kidnapped.

He's out there somewhere,
alone and cold

482
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,511
and most likely
trying to cobble together

483
00:19:43,512 --> 00:19:45,047
a sexy Patty Hearst costume.

484
00:19:45,048 --> 00:19:47,016
Britta's right.
Wait, what?

485
00:19:47,017 --> 00:19:48,767
We need to rescue the Dean.

486
00:19:48,768 --> 00:19:50,102
We need to get back
to that school.

487
00:19:50,103 --> 00:19:51,804
And we definitely never need
to do another paintball.

488
00:19:51,805 --> 00:19:53,388
- Yeah.
- See, therapy does work.

489
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,773
- We're cured.
- Aw. Aw.

490
00:19:59,028 --> 00:20:01,063
Sounds like the study group
has gotten wise

491
00:20:01,064 --> 00:20:03,398
to Operation Doppel-Deaner.

492
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,734
It's time for phase two.
What's phase two?

493
00:20:06,736 --> 00:20:08,487
Hey, I'm making up
the same plan you are.

494

Pitches, pitches, pitches.

495

Ah, thank you, Megan.
